        "The data is in a spreadsheet, with rows that correspond to each letter, and columns that identify the text of the letter (transcribed by a human, not OCR), the date it was sent, and who received it. This is a type of **structured data**.\n",

This repository includes a file of correspondence, `letters.csv`, which has the columns `text`, `date` (generally in YYYY-MM-DD format, but sometimes in YYYY-MM and sometimes just YYYY) and `recipient`. Each row in 'letters.csv' is a different letter, for a total of 269 letters. The mybinder.org notebook has the following R libraries preloaded:** \n",

        "For this, we will see if we can create some sort of data visualization based on the letters. R can do very basic visualizations. For more robust visualizations, or for more control, it is usually more advantageous to have the R code create a CSV file that you can then import into a data visualization program such as Flourish.Studio.\n",
