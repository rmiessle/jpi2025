TKE denied
College loan

Haaland "not confident in their ability
to function as a fraternity"

class," said Smith. "Our GPA went up a
good deal. . . and we stayed out of
trouble," he said. According to Smith,
Haaland "decided to go ahead without
looking" at the new class and the GPA.

point," said Haaland. "I want them to

The President of the Alumni
Board of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity,
which was closed down last spring due
to damages caused to the house by
brothers of the fraternity, has written a
letter to Gordon A. Haaland, President
of the College, to reconsider his deci
sion to deny the loan to the fraternity
to renovate.
"President Haaland deferred his
decision to make the loan until Decem
ber of 1998," said Dennis M. Murphy,
College Life. "It was too soon to tell
whether TKE was headed as a positive
contributor to Gettysburg life."
"I didn't think that TKE was ready
as a fraternity to participate in our loan
program," said Haaland.
Daniel Smith, President of Tau
Kappa Epsilon said that Haaland had
"promised to wait after rush."
"He was supposed tq wait and see
the pledge class and our GPA," said
Smith. Haaland decided a "bit earlier,"
he added.

Tau Kappa Epsilon was expected
to improve their GPA, maintain a high
behavior standard, and "recruit a strong
and diverse pledge class," said Murphy.
There are the "same issues that they are
recruiting the same Athletic team," he
said. "We feel we got a large diverse

organization."
"Another year would enable us to
determine the direction TKE is
heading,"said Murphy. "We are saying
to TKE to not to plan on staying in their
house and go through the hosing pro
cess." Tau Kappa Epsilon members plan
to live in their house next semester.
"Our board is trying to look at other
means," said Smith. "We are currently
looking at outside financial institu
tions."
If the loan is approved, the col
lege could provide up to $300,000 pro
vided the fraternity raises at least
$100,000. "The exact amount of the
loan is negotiated based on the nature
of the project," said Haaland.
The fraternity Alumni Board is
currently negotiating with Haaland. In
the interim, members of the fraternity
attended a retreat at a Manor in
Taneytown, Maryland, "as a group to
go over about our formal evaluations,"
said Smith.

$50,000 result of increased enrollment

by Keith Davis
Staff Reporter Many students question
the source behind the funding
of the Student Life Committee.
The $50,000 given to the
SLC by the administration is a
direct result of the increased
enrollment of first year stu
dents in the fall of 1997, ac
cording to President Haaland.
"The money basically
comes from more students en
rolled than we had budgeted
for," Haaland said.
The extra money avail
able is used as a contingency.
Because of the desire to im
prove social outlets for students
by both the student body and
the administration, the possi
bility for improvement became
more tangible. The available
desire and money lead to the
creation of the SLC experi¬

. "It was a spontaneous
decision but was made in con
junction with a lot of thinking
about the College's social life,"
Haaland.

President Haaland spoke
of the dilemma the administra
tion and some students, now
members of the SLC faced in a
forum. This forum met at the
end of last semester to discuss
the problems of social life for
students. According to
Haaland, the dilemmas faced
were rooted in the design of
current social activities. He
states that the are a lot of op
tions currently available such as,
readings, musical performances
and so forth but mentioned the

conflict between these events
and the diversity of students.
"The students are very
diverse and some activities are
just not designed for them," he
said. The SLC is responsible
for allocating the $50,000 to
groups interested in sponsoring
events for the entire campus.
There are a certain criteria the
committee will follow. Because
the committee of students is an
experiment its direction is not
yet known. The administration
has given no guarantee that

funding will continue into fu
ture semesters, however both
President Haaland and Dean
Ramsey are confident that SLC

will be successful.
"If it is successful, we will
do the best to keep it going,"
Haaland said.

Charusheela, these sidebars
were intended to stop export
ers from exploiting child labor.
During her presentation,
Charusheela will discuss
whether these sidebars "help or
hurt the group they are sup
posed to be protecting - the
abused children." She will also
examine possible alternatives
to, existing legislation that she
hopes might "ensure that the

legislative efforts."

According to Jan Pow
ers, adjunct associate professor
of interdepartmental studies
and coordinator of this year's
Area Studies Symposium, hu
man rights groups in the United
States have been at odds over
the question of whether child
labor is essential for the sur
vival of poor families in South
Asia, even though children's
health and safety are endan
gered by long working hours,
lack of schooling, and danger
ous worksites.

Sabres, rifles, and smiles

by Cara Masucci
Staff Reporter There are many different
activities and clubs on campus
that offer a wide variety of cul
tural experiences. The newly
founded Indoor Color Guard
is one of them. With sabres,
rifles, flags, and intricate dance
moves, the nine members at
tempt to capture beauty and
grace at its finest.
Indoor Color Guard is a
relatively new activity on cam
pus, drawing heavily upon the
initiative of several persistent
young women.
An extension of the Out
door Color Guard in the fall,
cofounders Clair Roberts and
Maureen Miller, Melanie
Milburn, Melodie Foster,
Mandi Latronica, Christina
Dickert, Kristin O'Neill, Laura
Fairbairn, and Katy Roy have
put forth a tremendous effort
to get this activity off the
ground this semester.

Color Guard itself is the
highly skilled performance
group of eight to fifteen mem
bers. It involves choreograph
ing moves and tosses of flags,
sabres, and rifles to a variety of
different types of music.
A performance based
upon interpretation, color
guard allows for a huge expres
sion of individuality and inten
sity by the performers, accord
ing to president Maureen
Miller.
This, the first year for the
Gettysburg College Indoor
Color Guard, has been a build
ing experience. Miller, a jun
ior, and Roberts, a first year
student, both came from very
competitive high school teams.
The rest of the team has

varying levels of experience.
What is really great is how they
are willing to work together,
says Miller.
Speaking to Miller, it be
came very clear how much of
effort has been put into the rou
tine. At the beginning of the
semester, the guard had two

grueling nine hour practice ses
sions where they learned the
basics of the performance.
Since then, they have
been practicing four hours a
week with an optional practice
for those who feel they need
to work on their technique.

The
women are very
con
cerned
with the
precision and ex
ecution of
their

moves.
Both Miller and Rob
erts com
mented
on the im
portance of timing,
and work
ing to
gether.
Ev
erything
has to be
exact for
the show
to be a
hit. That
takes a lot
of effort
on the
part of ev
eryone in
volved.

can mes appear
easier than they really are, but
there are things people do not
realize about the motions.
Some technical aspects include
posture and the positioning of
hands for tosses and spins.
Miller was quick to point
out that she was really happy
with how things were develop
ing. "I'm really proud of ev
eryone, and it's a lot of fun
when there are moments that

everything comes together."
For the newly formed In
door Color Guard, individual
ity and expression takes the
theme of Celtic Nights. Com
bining a very Irish selection of
music and a series of intricately
designed dance moves, the

theme burns throughout the
show. The group decided on the
Celtic theme because, according
to Roberts, they wanted to
make it beautiful. "It [color
guard] is an art form." The
music is full of passion, inten
sity, and radiance, much like the
art form itself.
Miller and Roberts wrote
the routine over winter break,
and Milburn (the choreogra¬

pher) helped iron out the rough
edges. The women used their
own experience in high school
color guard as a basis for teach
ing and instructing the other
members.
As Mandi Latronica,
whose mother made the flags

said, "It's amaz
ing that we put
this together as
kids." It has not
been an easy
battle, though.
Between gruel
ing practices
and having to go
out and find
their own equip
ment, the girls
know the real
meaning of hard
work. Over va
cation, and even

through their
season, the team
has devoted
much time to
making and fix
ing old equip
ment for the
routine. The
team also sets up
and takes down
their equipment
during the per
formances, since
they are given
only so much
time to get on
and off the
floor.

The group
is quick to point
out that the

campus community has been
very supportive of their efforts.
Earlier this year, Student Sen
ate allotted $500 to the guard.
Miller was enthusiastic about
the money and recognition the
team will be receiving from
Senate at the beginning of next
year. "Campus support means
so much to us," Miller said.
"We [perform] for the cam
pus."

The Indoor Color Guard
will be performing for the cam
pus on Wednesday, February
18th, at halftime of the men's
varsity basketball game. Gear
ing up for that performance, on
Saturday the women will travel
to Philadelphia for a competi
tion. The team will perform
against at least fifteen other
guards.
They would also like to
perform on campus again dur
ing Get Acquainted Day, and
another as yet unspecified per
formance.
One of the team's main
goals, outside of performing,
has been to boost membership
and interest in the organiza
tion. The women are very ea
ger to point out that the Indoor
Color Guard is something any
one can join.

It is not necessary to have
previous experience, one needs
only dedication and the willing
ness to work hard. The women
would like to expand the color
guard to include men as well.
Anyone interested in join
ing need not wait until next
fall. It is possible, according to
Robert and Miller, to come and
practice with the team.
While it might be too late
to compete, there are advan
tages to having a semester more
of training. That way, the
whole process can become
quite cyclical. If one were in
terested, he or she should con
tact Maureen Miller or Clair
Roberts.
The Indoor Color Guard
members are quite excited
about the future. Prospects for
success look good, and like the
Dance Ensemble, the guard
hopes to become an integral
part of campus life.

The hard work should
pay off, and from the laughs
and smiles at practices, the nine
women have gained a sense of
accomplishment and achieve
ment from laying the founda
tion for the Indoor Color
Guard, not to mention a feel
ing of fun.

Beware the
"Grim Reefer"

Valentine's Day for the lonely

by Kyle Heulitt
GECO Columnist

For years, people have
been awed by the beaury of
coral reefs. Aside from their
aesthetic appeal, coral reefs
give rise to a very complex and
diverse ecosystem, and provide
an ideal habitat for many or
ganisms. Unfortunately,
throughout the world, coral
reefs are being threatened by
human activity.
Reefs occur around the
world in clear, shallow, tropi
cal waters. Over thousands of
years, they are built up by tiny
coral animals called polyps,
which are aided by minute al
gae called zooxanthellae that
live in their tissue. Biologically,
coral reefs are the second most
productive systems in the
world after tropical rainforests.
Although they cover only one
percent of the earth's surface,
they are home to twenty-five
percent of all marine fish.
Reefs are also a potential
source for new medicines.

Chemical compounds from
tropical reef organisms show
promise of being effective
against diseases such as arthri
tis, cancer, and AIDS.
Threats to the reefs have
never been greater than they
are today. Their ecosystems are
disturbed by commercial fish
ing and harvesting of valuable
species, mining of reef lime
stone for building materials,
pollution and sedimentation
caused by deforestation, and
excessive coastal development.
Disease and damage from
pollution has wiped out huge

areas of the Florida Reef Tract,
the third largest coral reef sys
tem in the world, as well as in
parts of the Caribbean and
Asia. An increase in phospho
rous and nitrogen levels due to
human waste and agricultural
run-off has caused life-destroy
ing algal blooms, covering the
coral and killing it. Careless
anchoring and accidental boat
groundings have also de
stroyed years of coral growth
in minutes.
Experts also agree that if
reefs are to be preserved, the
sale, importation, and harvest
ing of corals must end. In third
world countries, thousands of
tons of living corals are being
ripped from the reef by cranes
and sold in foreign markets,
notably the U.S.

Worldwide, approxi
mately ten percent of all reefs
have degraded beyond recov
ery, and if current practices go
unchecked, it is estimated that
twenty to thirty percent of the
resource could be destroyed
within the next ten to twenty
years. Fortunately, many
threats to coral reefs are re
versible and preventable, but
we must act before any more
damage is done. If we do not,
we will have destroyed in mere
decades what it took thousands
of years to create.

Saturday is the big day, and the card and candy makers will not let us forget it.
There is a large number of people out there who think that Valentine's Day should be
wiped off the calendar forever. Obviously, we are the people who do not have a "signifi
cant other" (s.o.) this Valentine's Day. Valentine's Day was a happy day until about
fourth grade, when we stopped exchanging valentines with everyone in our class. For us,
it is now a day of pure misery, when our lack of a boyfriend/girlfriend is clearly shown.
Unfortunately for us, this year, the big V-Day falls on a Saturday. So what do we do this
Saturday night, without someone special to share it with? Here's a list that I've come up
with (with the help of my many single friends).
1. Sit in your room with some Ben &C Jerry's and cry.
2. Pretend it's just any other day and conduct business as usual.
3. Hit on every guy/girl/farm animal you see in hopes of getting a s.o. by the end of
the evening.

4. (Over 21) Go to JD's and get wasted
(Under 21) Goto LD's and just be happy
5. Hang out with other people who don't have a s.o.
6. Crash someone else's date
7. Send yourself roses.
8. Listen to sappy music.
9. Read a trashy romance novel.
10. Call the psychic hotline.
11. Write a nasty letter to an ex.
12. Flirt with someone on the Internet.
13. Think up evil sayings for those little candy hearts.
14. Send evil valentines to people.
15. Watch romantic comedies and boo at the end.
16. Watch tragic love stories and cheer at the end.
17. Leave town and spend the night in a cave.
18. One word: Chocolate.
19. Go see Titanic—you're going to have to eventually anyway. If it's not at the
Majestic, I'm sure it's somewhere within driving distance.
20. Make hearts out of red construction paper and burn them with a few close
friends.

the time.
• 70% of rape survivors
physically resisted the rape in
some manner.

• 92% of the time when
a woman reports a rape, she's
telling the truth.
• 84% of rape survivors
tried unsuccessfully to reason
with the man who raped her.
In the last half of 1995,
432,700 incidents of rape, at
tempted rape, and sexual as
sault, happened to women in
the United States. This
amounts to 99 women every
hour. • 42% of rape survivors
told no one about the rape.
• 42% of rape victims
had sex again with the rapist.
• 41% of women who are
raped expect to be raped again.

• 30% of rape victims
contemplate suicide after the
rape. • 84% of men who com
mitted rape said that what they
did was definitely not rape.
• 55% of gang rapes on
college campuses are done by
fraternities, 40% by sports
teams, 5% by others.
• 35% of men report
some likelihood that they
would rape if they could be as
sured thy would not be caught.
Women who are raped
define their experience as such:
1/4 define it as rape, 1/4 think
it was a crime but did not know
it was rape, 1/4 believed it was
serious sexual abuse but did not
know it was a crime, 1/4 did
not feel victimized by the ex
perience.

Rape is common world
wide, with 19%-28% of col
lege women reporting rape or
attempted rape all over the
world. In many countries,
women are treated far worse
than in the United States.
Statistics were taken from
John D. Foubert's "The Men's
Program: 'How to Help a
Sexual Assault Survivor: What
Men Can Do."
These may be difficult
facts to accept, but they are
facts. Rape can happen to any
one: friend, family member, co
worker, or peer - male or fe
male. However, in 99% of all
rapes or attempted rapes

women are the victims. Yes,
rape occurs on the small cam
pus of Gettysburg College, as
it is a problem on every college
campus.
If someone who is close
to you is a recent survivor, here
are some ways that you can
help: 1. Tend to her needs.
Make sure both her medical
and emotional needs are met.
Be sure that she can feel safe.
2. No More Violence.
Saying that you are going to
beat him up is usually the last
thing she wants to hear. The
best advice is to let her know
you are upset that this hap
pened to her and that you will
do anything to help her re
cover.

3. Comfort her. What
she does need from you is to
be comforted. Let her be in
charge - she may want a hug,
some don't want to be touched.
4. Listen. Don't ask for
details. Don't suggest why it
happened. Listen to what she
wants to say, and don't judge
her. 5. Believe her. The single
most important factor in recov
ery is whether or not she is be
lieved. There is a 92% chance
she's telling the truth.
6. Give her control. Get
her to make small decisions,
whether about a restaurant or
a soda. Accept her decisions
even if you don't agree. Be

patient, it will take her a long
time to decide.
7. Realize limitations.
Victims often remain in acute
trauma for three months. One
year recovery time is common,
even with counseling, and some
take years.
Refer the rape victim to
counseling!
Don't talk to the survivor
about your own feelings, but do
talk to others. If you are over
whelmed, get counseling for
yourself.
We are fortunate at
Gettysburg to have a number
of resources for survivors. En
courage the survivor to get the
medical attention that they
need as well as the crucial coun
seling she needs.
• Health Center (x6972)
• Gettysburg Hospital
(334-2121 or 334-0468)
• Counseling Center
(x6960)
• Crisis Intervention

(334-2121)
• Survivors (334-9777)
If the individual wants to
report the rape, call Security
(x6911) or the Borough Police
(334-1168).
If you are a survivor, you
are not alone. One in four. . .
look around.
All-male peer education
programs are the most effective
means to change men's atti
tudes toward rape. If you are
interested in taking part in such

a group, contact Dennis

Activities, or e-mail him at

Blues redux
All the music; few of the laughs

Reel Hits & Misses

by Dan Larkin and Mike Petro
Movie Columnists
Mike: Jake's dead, and
Elwood is back to bring the
world the blues. That is, Dan
Aykroyd and John Landis have
teamed up to bring the Blues
Brothers back to the big screen.
Dan: To be honest, the
very idea of resurrecting this
classic of American comedy
without John Belushi is some
thing close to blasphemy. De
spite this, I still tried to enter

Blues Brothers 2000 with a
relatively open mind. I'm re
ally not sure why I bothered.
In BB2K, Jake has passed
on to that big gig in the sky,
and Elwood is left to face the
world on his own. So as you
may very well guess, he does
the only thing he knows how
to do: he buys an old police car
from a surplus yard owned by
aspiring musician Malvern
Gasperon (B.B. King), and sets
about "getting the band back
together."

What follows is more in
tune with a remake than a se
quel. Elwood, played by a sig
nificantly slimmer Dan
Aykroyd (Dragnet), teams up
with some new "brothers":

Mighty Mack, the replacement
big guy, played by John
Goodman (Barton Fink), Cabel
"Cab" Chamberlain, played by
Joe Morton (Terminator 2),
and Buster, played by J. Evan
Bonifant (3 Ninjas Kick Back).
As a general rule, Dan
Aykroyd is only funny when he
teams up with someone else
who can carry the comedic
weight (i.e. Belushi in the origi
nal Blues Brothers, Bill Murray
in Ghostbusters, Eddie Murphy
in Trading PlacesJ. In BB2K,
Aykroyd has to carry the entire
movie on his shoulders, and it
just doesn't work.
The only laughs the movie
provides come more from a rec
ognition factor than actual
comedy, as the sequel revisits
the original ad nauseam.
Goodman, who is capable of
excellent comedic perfor
mances, is not an asset here.

As Elwood and his new
found "family" set about to
find the scattered band, they
become the focus of a state to
state police chase, upset the
Russian mafia, and enrage
some right-wing militia mem
bers. Sound familiar?
This is a movie that never
should have been revived. The

biggest indicator of a franchise
showing its age and lack of en
ergy is the addition of an obnox
ious little kid. Buster's addition
to the cast is reminiscent of the
introduction of Oliver to the
Brady Bunch in its last season
after Bobby and Cindy weren't
as cute as they used to be. While
he may not be as annoying as
Oliver, Buster is yet another of
the many strikes against BB2K.
Let me be honest with
everyone. This movie's plot is
terrible. The first Blues Broth
ers became a revered cult hit
because it is genuinely funny
throughout the movie, and it
had an unbelievable cast. This
movie's plot is not funny, and I
found it lacking energy.
Lacking a certain energy
is putting it mildly to say the
least. BB2K goes through the
motions, duplicating the plot of
the original, minus most of the
laughs. The best example of this
can be seen in the car chase

scenes, which attempt to repli
cate some of the fun of the first
movie, but fall so short of their
mark that one wonders why the
film's creators even bothered.
HOWEVER, this movie
flat out blows away the first
when it comes to music. With

the exception of Aretha
Franklin singing "Respect" to
Matt "Guitar" Murphy, all the
songs are different from the
original movie.
Furthermore, the talent
overflows in this movie.
Aykroyd, Goodman, Bonifant,
and Morton are all solid, but
it is the entire band that really
rocks this movie. Even beyond
the Blues Brothers band itself,
we see other music greats such
as James Brown, Wilson
Pickett, Johnny Lang, Blues
Traveller, and much more than

my knowledge of music allows
me to even recognize.
The best scene in this
movie comes at the end when
the Blues Brothers enter a
battle of the bands against the
Louisiana Gator Boys at
Queen Mousette's, a voodoo
club. Queen Mousette
(Erykah Badu) obviously has
an eye for talent because the
Gator Boys consist of Eric
Clapton, B.B. King, Bo
Diddley, Isaac Hayes, Dr.
John, Billy Preston, Lou
Rawls, Travis Tritt, and Steve
Winwood.

I needn't tell you what
kind of performance they put
on. But I will say this, in a year

when Puff Daddy sells millions
of records for stealing-oops
sorry-"sampling" from every
one under the sun, it was a fan
tastic experience to see and
hear master musicians practice
their craft.
In Puff's defense, he
doesn't strictly sample, but re
record and .update classic
grooves for a new audience
(which, I suppose, is what
Aykroyd and Landis are at
tempting to do with this se
quel). But I digress.
Yeah, the music is good.
But I went to see this movie
hoping to be entertained. What
I got instead is a tepid remake
of a movie that should have
been allowed to rest in peace.
People shouldn't waste
their time or money on this tur
key. For the music, I give this
one star (out of five). If you
want to hear the music, I sug
gest you buy the soundtrack.

I was disappointed that
this installment of the Blues
Brothers didn't make me laugh
as much as the first did. How
ever, the music really impressed
me. I give this movie two and
a half stars out of five. The
movie is the music, and the
music makes it worth seeing.

Happy drives
laughter home

by Eileen O'Donnell
Movie Columnist

Finally, someone has
made golf fun again. Adam
Sandier is hilarious starring in
Happy Gilmore, the best golf
movie since Caddyshack.
Ever since he learned to
skate, Happy Gilmore
(Sandier) has wanted to be a
hockey player. He holds two
junior hockey records: most
minutes spent in the penalty
box, and for being the first
person to take off his skate
and try to stab someone.
Since graduation, Happy has
been working odd jobs be
tween hockey tryouts. After
being passed over again,
Happy's life takes a strange

. Happy's grandmother,
who raised him after his fa
ther was killed by a Terry
O'Reilly slap-shot at a Bruins
hockey game, has had her
home repossessed by the IRS.
After winning a long-drive bet
with the movers, Happy sees
a way to make the $270,000
he needs to buy back the
house his grandfather built.
With his hot temper,
Happy doesn't seem like your
typical placid golfer. With
Chubbs Peterson (Carl Weath
ers) as his coach, Happy wins
a spot on the pro tour. On
the pro tour, Happy battles
Bob Barker and an alligator,

and falls in love with the tour's
PR agent (Julie Bowen). With
her help, Happy will try to beat
the arrogant tour favorite,
Shooter McGavin (Christopher
McDonald).
Sandler's brand of comedy
is one of a kind. In Happy
Gilmore he has the ability to
please all kinds of audiences,
young and old, with his antics
and running commentary about
the "sport" of golf.
Sandler's performance is
bolstered by his supporting cast,
which includes evil nurse Ben
Stiller {Reality Bites), construc
tion foreman Richard Kiel, and

existential golfer Kevin Nealon.
Since leaving Saturday
Night Live, Sandler's career has
skyrocketed. He was a very
popular cast member, playing
such roles as "Opera Man" and
the obsessive host of "The
Denise Show." By the time
Happy Gilmore was released in
1996, Sandier had already re
leased two comedy albums, and
had starred in Billy Madison and
Airheads with Brendan Fraser
(George of the Jungle). Late last
year he released his third album,
What's Your Name?, as well as a
new rendition of the ever-popu
lar "Chanukah Sons."

Sandier currently stars in
The Wedding Singer, which will
be released tomorrow. If it's any
thing like Sandler's other cin
ematic efforts, it will be a defi
nite hif.

Conflict and Consensus

by Christina Dickert
Columnist Welcome to my first col
umn. My apologies to the fans
of political columns, but this
column is definitely not about
the leaders of our land. Actu
ally, it's not really about any
thing. Before Jerry Seinfeld's
lawyers come after me for roy
alties (What would I give them?
My tuition bill?), I'll admit that
this column will have some sort
of topic every time it appears.
What sort of topic? That, my
friends, will be decided a few
hours before it is written. Now
that you know where I am com
ing from, on with the show.
"Shut up. Just shut up.
You had me at hello. (Sniffle.)

You had me at hello."
Even if you hate Tom
Cruise or haven't seen Jerry
Maguire a hundred times, you
know that these words are ut
tered at the end of the movie's
theme song, "Secret Garden."
I don't think that Tom Cruise
is the best actor in the world
(Sorry all you Tom fans out
there!!), but I admit that I know
ever single spoken word in that
song. Even though it is so
cheesy, that song is sacred to
me. It will forever be in my
memory from my high school
days. Picture this: A group of
high school seniors are driving
around on a Friday or Saturday
night when this song comes on
the radio. They all scream the
words at the top of their lungs
with enough emotion for six

drama departments, like they
were Dorothy Boyd with Jerry
Maguire sitting right next to
them. So, when I hear the new
"remixed" version of Celine
Dion's "The Heart Does Go
On" with the neat little twist
of words added from the
movie, it makes me want to lis
ten to Englebert Humperdink.
"Secret Garden" was an acci
dent, folks. Some DJ thought
that it would be cool if he
added these word into this
song. Surprisingly, it worked.
Once. It does not work with
the Titanic song. First of all,
there is background music from
the movie played over the ac
tual song, _s Secondly, there is
about one catch phrase in all
of Titanic. Sure, the movie is

beautifully written, but all you
really remember walking out of
the movie is, "If you jump, I
jump." Lastly, I don't think that
"ICEBERG, RIGHT
AHEAD!!" is on the same ro
mantic level as "You complete
me." I don't know. Maybe it's
just me. Maybe "Secret Gar
den" just holds some amount of
sentimental value from those

oh-so-long-ago high school
weekends. Maybe deep down
inside, I am really a Tom Cruise
fan. But as much as I love Ti
tanic and know every word
that Celine sings, I refuse to lis
ten to that poor excuse for a
remix. I just wish that people
(especially music executives
with dollar signs in their eyes)
would just leave a beautifully
orchestrated ballad alone.

A Message from
President Haaland

In recent months, there's
been a great deal of public dis
cussion about ethnicity and
quotas as factors in the college
admission process. Since this is
an ongoing issue—not just at
Gettysburg, but at colleges and
universities across the U.S.—I
want to take this opportunity
to articulate Gettysburg
College's stance on this impor
tant topic.
As a private institu
tion, Gettysburg College is not
bound by federal or state legis
lation regarding admissions or
hiring. Racial quotas have been
illegal since the 1978 Bakke
decision, and Gettysburg Col
lege has never used a quota sys
tem in its admissions decisions.
The College's private
status does-not, however, ex
empt usfrom a moral and ethi
cal obligation to reach out to
people of all racial and ethnic
backgrounds, both when we
recruit students and when we

hire faculty, administrators, and
staff. At Gettysburg College, we
believe that increasing the di
versity of our student body and
our faculty will create a more
vibrant learning community,
one which better reflects the
reality of life in America.
While it would be a
disservice to all involved to
admit any student who was in¬

capable of succeeding at Get
tysburg, we are working very
hard to attract students who
bring something special to our
community. The admissions
process allows for consider
ation of many factors, includ
ing academic performance, spe
cial talents, community service,
past family associations with
the College, and so on.
In short, students who
bring different cultural and eth
nic backgrounds with them to
Gettysburg enhance the expe
rience of everyone here at the
College. We all benefit from
efforts to make Gettysburg a
more diverse community.

I hope you all will join
me in further examination of
this issue throughout the se
mester. In particular, I invite
you all to the February 19
Town Meeting, which will fo
cus on "Diversity Matters."
Mari Matsuda, professor of law
at Georgetown University and
a vocal supporter of diversity
in higher education, will be our
guest speaker. After her brief
talk, Professor Matsuda, Abbey
Rogers, and I will lead a ques
tion-and-answer period. The
Town Meeting begins at 11:30
a.m. and will be held in the
CUB Ballroom. I look forward
to seeing you there.

Conflict and Consensus

Scarred and Battered:

A student's assessment of our liberal arts education

by Henry Fawell
Staff Writer In two and a half years
here at Gettysburg College, 1
have been fortunate to learn
from a number of intelligent,
energetic, and insightful profes
sors who have a firm under
standing of the responsibilities
inherent in their profession. I
am in debt to these men and
women for their inspiring
teaching which has encouraged
me to explore my dearest in
terests and beliefs to the best
of my ability and for the even¬

tual betterment of my future.
And through my coming
years I will be equally affected
by a small group of professors
who, in my view, willfully ig
nored the passions of their stu
dents and chose instead to use
their respective courses as ve
hicles to promote their own
prejudicial political and social
viewpoints. These professors
presented to their students
ideas that undermined the tra
ditional classroom foundations
of respect and consideration
and quickly entered the realms
of hate.

On January 14, the first
day of classes, I attended a
course pertaining to western
. literature, mostly American.
After listening to the first five
minutes of the professor's
opening remarks, I was
tempted to leave the classroom.
But I chose, rather, to jot down
so <me of her remarks, which
centered around the literature
of Western civilization.
As most of you surely
know, this literature genre en
compasses the works of Walt
Whitman, Harriet Beecher
Stowe, William Shakespeare
and a number of other works,
including the King James Bible.
Here is a list of my notes:
1. White male authority
is looking to control and domi

6. A quote from the pro
fessor, "History people hate
me, but that just means I'm do
ing my job." (My favorite, be
ing a History major).
What left me even more
bewildered was the absence of
Ernest Hemingway, Flannery
O'Conner and other notable
writers of this genre from the
course syllabus.
I later bumped into a peer
from class who, like me,
dropped it as soon as we were
excused. During our conver
sation, I was struck by his com
ment, "I just wanted to read the
things that move me. She won't
let me do that."

For the first time, I sensed
disappointment in a remark
ably easygoing and optimistic
student who, like me, switched
into the section of another pro
fessor whose methods were not
quite so personal. This incident
indicates a problem, not with
the course, but with a specific
section of it.
This semester is not the
first in which I have experi
enced such an instance. Over a
year ago I took a class pertain
ing to the ancient Greeks and
soon discovered the professor

had a far more narrow agenda
than I had anticipated.
To shorten a painfully
complex discussion we had in
class, I remarked that it was
difficult for a civilization to cre
ate a "just" state, but if each
person relied not on others, but
on themselves it would create
a fairly healthy society. The
professor told me, in the pres
ence of over a dozen of my
peers, that I think like a Nazi
and a slave holder. I sincerely
doubt those of you who know
me would subscribe to this no
tion. It is possible that I did not
present my argument clearly

but, nonetheless, the remark
was a shock, and an embarrass
ment, to an 18 year old who
merely wanted to advance his
fledgling knowledge on classi
cal civilization.
Had I dropped the course
at this time, I would not have
heard the professor later praise
the Greek heroine Medea, for
killing her children so that their
father, her former husband,
could no longer see them. I
also would not have been
handed an essay question pro
posing how the Greek epics
The Iliad and The Odyssey had
been written, not by Homer,
but rather by an anonymous

woman.
If the professors in ques
tion are reading this article,
they may be unable to find the
problem at all, since these are
their comments and I imagine
they would stick to them. But
there is a problem that needs
to be addressed, and, fortu
nately, there is a surprisingly
simple solution.
Department chairs
should, before the beginning of
a semester, be well informed of
what curriculum will he used

in a given section and what that
professors' intentions will be.
If the Chair feels the professor
is straying from the structure
of the course, or if the profes
sor refuses to adhere to the de
scription set forth in the Col
lege Catalogue, than a separate
course should be created under
a different title for those stu
dents still interested. This way,
the three sections of a given
course will present the same
general curriculum, thereby
preventing students from being
mislead in the future.
I find the methods prac
ticed by these professors in
complete contradiction to the
liberal arts education, yet I
must support their natural right
to express their ideas. Further
more, I am not concerned with
restricting a professor from his
or her right to teach, but I am
concerned for our right, as stu

Consider this

Overhearing conversa
tions around campus about the
college we attend, it is hard not
to notice the fact that the com
ments made are overwhelm
ingly negative.
Students complain about
everything from tuition and
Gordon Haaland to the food at
Servo. What this college lacks is
school spirit.
Many of us went to high
schools that were overflowing
with school spirit. We got ex
cited about homecoming and
playing our big rivals. We at
tended pep rallies and painted
our faces.
Naturally, there are ex
ceptions to this rule. But there
is nobody out there that does
not know what school spirit is.
Attendance of events on
this campus is pathetic. The
football stadium is practically
empty in the fall, and though
many of our sports teams do
exceedingly well, there is rarely
anybody there to cheer them
on. Sports events are not the
only ones that are neglected.
Theater productions, recitals,
and Common Hours, to name
a few, are incredibly under at
tended.
We attend an outstanding
school. It is not perfect; but
what school is? The problems
that many students find with
Gettysburg would be found at

any similar school. And we too
often forget how lucky we are
to even be attending such an
institution of higher learning.
Maybe nobody notices
those signs that proclaim that
our dining services are among
the best of the nation. Maybe
people spend too much of their
time drunk to notice all the op
portunities available to us.
People complain that
there is nothing to do on this
campus. Check out "This Week
at Gettysburg." The calendar
is full of lectures, social events,
and functions happening
around campus. If a person did
not have to worry about classes
and homework, he or she could
spend all week running from
place to place.
Homecoming weekend
here is geared completely to
wards alumni. Students should
be out at the football game,
rooting on our team and inter
acting with the people that
made Gettysburg what it is.
We should support our
teams, our friends, our peers.
Those people on stage, on the
fields, on the courts are the
same people who we go to
classes with. If you were per
forming, wouldn't you want
someone there to appreciate
you? Gettysburg College is not
perfect, but it is a good place.
We should take the time we're
here to appreciate it.

— Conflict and Consensus—
From the Donkey's Mouth

Clinton will come through this

by Matt Brown
Political Columnist
I don't know about the
rest of you, but I am certainly
starting to get sick of all the at
tention that is being paid to the
stories of Monica Lewinsky.
You would think that with a
crisis in the Middle East brew
ing, that the media would pay
a considerable bit more atten
tion to that situation than to all
the rumors being spread about
our nation's president and
some mixed up girl who we are
starting to learn a lot about.
I wonder if Republicans
would still cry that the media
is liberal after all that has been

said about the president. I can
see our friends on the fringe of
right wing politics foaming at
the mouth, hoping that these
allegations of an affair and sub
orning perjury bring down the
president. The opponents of
the president think they can
dupe the American people into
looking at these allegations
more critically then the
president's many successes.
But that is not going to happen.
The American people are
upset that some of the allega
tions could be true, but they
also see how well our country
is doing. The American people
realize that this is not the first

time that a president has been
accused of or actually had an
affair. In fact, our nation's first
president, the great George
Washington, whom we remem
ber fondly this month, has been
accused of having an affair.
Throughout history, our
president's have had or have
rumored to have had affairs,
Franklin Roosevelt,
Eisenhower, Kennedy, LBJ,
Bush all fall into this category.
I know we all like to think that
our president's are perfect
models in every way, but they
are flawed just like us. Despite
these rumors however, our na
tion has continued to have
strong leaders. Bill Clinton is
one such strong leader, the
American people overwhelm¬

ingly approve of the way that
President Bill Clinton is doing
his job. We have the lowest
unemployment rate in 24 years.
America is experiencing the
highest level of home owner
ship ever. Crime rates are fall
ing. Incomes are rising.
America's commitment to im
proving education is growing.
Thanks to President Clinton,
we finally have'a balanced bud
get. No matter what the right
says about his morals, that can
not take away his successes. In
fact after all he's done, I won
der what kind of buildings they
will be naming after him when
his 87th birthday comes
around.
We just have to accept
that we do not yet know what
has happened between the
president and Monica

Lewinsky. It is quite premature
to make blanket attacks against
the president. The fact is that
every time this pawn of the
right, Ken Starr, has tried to get
the president on something he
has failed. I think it only right
and proper that the Justice
Department to begin to inves
tigate this man. So many things
have leaked out of his office,
he has spent so much of
America's tax dollars and all he
has to show for it is the con
victions of a small number of
Clinton associates. I think we
should question if this lawyer

is not out for justice, but ven
geance against the president.
We need to know if Ken Starr
is wasting our money. After all,
we are looking to cut govern
ment spending and I think it
would be better to cut the
spending of a fruitless crusade
then any other worthwhile pro
gram. Who knows how much
more could have been done
with the money that Ken Starr
has wasted on chasing after the
president. Regardless of what
I think, it is high time to see
whether or not Ken Starr is car
rying out his investigation in a
judicious way.
Who is this Monica
Lewinsky anyway? As the story

unfolds we see that she was
surrounded by a sketchy
crowd. Linda Tripp_, the friend
that records her conversations,
a woman bent on bringing
down President Clinton, writ
ing a book to make profit from
her supposed knowledge.
Tripp's publisher, a woman
who believes she will person
ally will be a hero for bringing
down the president. Lewinsky,
herself, has been involved in
numerous affairs. Lewinsky
was supposedly obsessed with

the president. The facts point
to a record of lying and ques
tionable behavior on the part
of Miss Monica Lewinsky. Can
we trust these women?
I am afraid that we may
never know or may never truly
be able to believe what has hap
pened. So many people have
blackened President Clinton's
good name that we may not be
able to sort out the truth of
what happened for quite some
time. It might be pertinent to
remember that the central fig¬

ure of right wing ideology,
Ronald Reagan whom Repub
licans are so eager to name
things after, faced a crisis in his
presidency with the Iran-Con
tra scandal. 'Like Reagan, I be
lieve that President Clinton will
weather the storm (and who
knows perhaps one day there
will be a nonsense rush to name
things after him too). Not only
will Clinton weather the storm,
but I believe he will successfully
continue to tackle the chal
lenges facing America.

Missing morals

by Cammie Grant
Political Columnist

been placed on Colorado Re
publicans by Colorado Demo
crats. All accusations have been
denied by the Republican Party
Why do the Democrats point
their finger to the Republican
Party when private, potentially
harmful information is un
earthed?
Not only in Clinton's al
leged affair, but now the Re
publicans are to blame for
Romer's relationship. It is time
for the Democratic Party to pay
the price, which may be their
reputation, and admit their
wrong doings.

Chairman of the Demo
cratic National Committee and
Colorado Governor, Roy
Romer admitted last week to a
16 year relationship with B.J.
Thornberry. Thornberry
worked on many of Romer's
Colorado gubernatorial cam
paigns and was his assistant at
the Democratic National Com
mittee in Washington D.C.
Governor Romer has been ac
cused of having an affair with
Thornberry for many years and
has repeatedly denied it.
Insight Magazine re¬

leased a cover story early
Thursday morning on the
Internet summarizing the de
tails of Romer's relationship
with Thornberry. The maga
zine stated, "Insight has ob
tained confidential records-in
cluding photographs and video
tapes-purportedly showing that
Romer may have had more
than a platonic relationship." A
Denver private investigator was
hired to track Romer in 1995
and uncover details about his
private life, according to In
sight Magazine. Blame has

Governor Romer told the
Denver Post, "We worked this
out among ourselves. We knew
it would not fit the public per
ception." Roy, of course it does
not fit the public perception;
screwing around on your wife
with another woman is not
morally correct and the public
should shun Roy Romer. When
asked about his denials con
cerning his relationship with
Thronberry he said, "I was
carefully answering about hav
ing a sexual affair. I am not a
very sexual person." Romer's
wife, Bea prepared a public
statement, "B.J. Thornberry is

a close friend of Roy's. He has
been open with me and shared
the facts about the relationship
with me from the beginning. It
has not affected our marriage
or our family. I ask people to
respect our private lives." Mrs.
Romer's statement is tasteful
and brief. She, ' however, will
not openly admit the pain her
husband's relationship has
caused. Even if Governor
Romer is not sleeping with
Thornberry, having an extra
marital relationship is unac
ceptable.
What I find most disturb
ing is the fact the Colorado
Governor and Democratic Na
tional Committee Chairman
has lied repeatedly when ac
cused of a relationship with
Thornberry. How can the
people of Colorado and mem
bers of the Democratic Na
tional Committee trust this
man, not only with the future
of Colorado but, the future of
the Democratic Party?

Maybe extramarital af
fairs are a way of life for high
ranking Democrats. My advice
to Bill and Roy, get some mor
als and values, if not for your
selves, but for the individuals
for whom you are representing.

Senate works and works

Battered

by John Dunlap
Political Columnist
Within the next month
another session of Gettysburg
College's Student Senate will
come to an end, as new elec
tions are held. Having served
on Senate since the beginning
of my freshman year I have
come to the conclusion that
Senate can and most of the time
does work. This year has been
a good year for Student Senate.
Under the leadership of Senate
President Abby Rogers and Vice
President Val Katzmar, the Sen¬

ate has moved at more swift
and decisive pace in enacting
change and getting things done.
Today Senate, is at the fore
front of pushing for so
cial change on _^^^^m
t h e _^^^_K_^
ing to _^^^^_L _^^^H
brine _^^^^^_A_^^^^H

cam
pus.

t h e _^^^_M
a d - _^^^H
minis
t r a -
tion has an important an
nouncement to make or policy
to implement they often come
before Student Senate. Take
for instance, President Gordon
Haaland's announcement just a
few weeks ago that the student
body will have fifty thousand
dollars to spend on all-campus
social events. It was Senate that
started the campus discussion
on the new sexual consent
policy. Dean Julie Ramsey
came to Student Senate to first
discuss the changes.
As a member of Senate
representing the Class of 2000,

I feel as if I have an obligation
to represent the opinion of my
entire class, as well as the Col
lege as a whole. Student Sen
ate is the vehicle for communi
cation between the administra
tion, the faculty, and between
each class as well. The money
we appropriate in Senate is
your money, the money you
pay to go to Gettysburg Col
lege. This is why I was proud
when, after a great debate, Sen
ate decided to fully fund the
Civil War Club. This is Get
tysburg after all, the site of the
greatest battle of the Civil
War.

Senate
this year has
had

_^^^^^^_H many
interest
ing de
bates and
discussions on some of the
prominent issues facing our
campus and how we spend the
money we are given.
There is nothing wrong
with debate; we are a legisla
tive body and as representatives
of the entire campus's views
than debate is only inevitable.
Discussion and debate in Sen
ate is not limited to Senators
and club representatives, but is
open to everyone. More of the
campus should get involved
and come to Senate. This is our
College, and if we feel it is

moving in the wrong direction,
or are dissatisfied with a cer
tain policy than Senate is where
our grievance can be heard.
Change can occur, and I
have seen it. Last year, because
I felt that Senate was at times
overly long and very drawn
out, I along with my colleague
Ted Hartman drafted a contract
with Gettysburg. Its purpose
was to reform the Senate pro
cess. Working with all of Sen
ate and Senate's Executive
Board it was com
posed.

W Wnn
I felt
that
members

^^^^^^ of the stu
^^^_r dent body were
wronged by the
denial of tenure of
Dr. Edward DeClair
of the Political Science
Department, I took my
concern to Student Senate.
What I found out was that I
was not alone, as students in
and outside of the Political Sci
ence Department rallied to Dr.
DeClair's side. While the ad
ministration failed to reverse
their decision concerning Dr.
DeClair we were able to see
how the tenure process worked
and hopefully, we the student
body will get to play a larger
role in the future, when it
comes to deciding who will be
teaching us.

Senate has had a lot of
success. Before I arrived on
campus it was Senate that was
able to keep _iVlusselman Li
brary open 24 hours a day. It
is Senate that funds the
College's clubs and organiza
tions. Much more is left to be
done. Before Senate moves
forward more internal changes
are necessary.

The Residence Hall Sena
tors idea should be done away
with. Today the Vice President
of each hall gets to serve on
Senate. Many times people
elected from these dorms do
not know that they have to go
to Senate and in some dorms
people switch around who will
represent them at Senate. Vice
Presidents of dorms should
have the same position as club
representatives. Currently, it
does not seem that they feel
fully part of Senate and in their
place the number of Senators
per class should be increased to
at least seven, perhaps even
eight. Beyond the change
within Senate itself, the social
life of the campus is dramati¬

cally changing. With B.Y.O.B
and the weakening of Greek
organizations on campus as a
social outlet for students, more
must be done to make Gettys
burg an enjoyable place to live
and work. This is an issue that
Senate and the Student Activi
ties Council are currently
working on. The fifty-thou
sand dollars that has been ap
propriated for social programs
is a good idea. As chairman of
the sub-committee on how the
money shall be spent, Val
Katzmar explained last week at
Senate, this is only to hold us
over. We need a long-term fix
to aid the social environment
of this College and- the next
Senate will be crucial in decid
ing what that fix will be.

Senate should be doing
more to help strengthen the
Greek organizations on cam
pus. Gettysburg College owes
fraternities and sororities a lot.
For years they were the social
outlets for the student body
and now with new rules and
regulations, their roles are
changing. They need help in
making that change. First of
all, we all need to chip in and
help Alpha XI Delta; if its
chapter were to come to an end
that would be a real tragedy.
Lastly, the Senate's new
leadership and members should

remember that while we must
work with administration to
enact change, it's also our re
sponsibility to stand up to the
administration when we think
they are wrong. We can never
forget that this is our campus
and for at least four years of
our life this is home, and we
have responsibility to make it
better.

- continued from page 11-

dents, to study the concepts
that motivate us to open our
minds to education.
Beyond all the social
events and activities that reso
nate through our campus, each
student, at least once, takes a
course not as a requirement,
but because it speaks to the
principles that govern him or
her as an individual. We should
be deeply concerned for the
safety of these issues, which
spark each one of us, though
we may not admit it, to con
tinue reading a book beyond its'
given assignment. If these pre
cious ideas are twisted and dis
torted by even a few willing
professors, then the founda
tions of a liberal arts education
will inevitability crumble with
them.

There is simply no room
on this campus for prejudice
against a culture, gender or
race, nor should statements ba
ed on strident ideologies or po
itics be tolerated by anyone.
Instead, students and profes
sors alike should work to em
brace the virtues of fairness and
impartiality, while living up to
both professional and moral
standards. When we accom
plish this, our classrooms will
flourish with a fundamental
basis of respect for all the cul
tures and ideas that humanity,
in it's great complexity, has to
offer us.

Bullets take title, then fall
hard to Hopkins

It's that time of year

By Pete Huminski
Staff reporter Last weekend was an
other successful weekend for
the Lady Bullets basketball
team. On Friday night, Get
tysburg defeated Wesley Col
lege to advance to the cham
pionship game of the Gettys
burg Invitational.
In the championship
game the Lady Bullets faced
NAIA Georgian Court. Get
tysburg got out of the gate
quickly outsconng the Lions
12-0 in the first 4:01 of the
ball game. The Lions were
unable to overcome this fast
start as the Bullets held off
several Georgian Court runs
to win 71-60.

Tournament MVPs Jen
Dravis and Jamie Dawson got
the Bullets off to a quick start
scoring six points each dur
ing the opening run. Geor

Wrestlers gear up
From the Gettysburg College
Press release
Gettysburg College's
Jake Dell will attempt to win
his weight class for the fourth
year in a row when the Cen
tennial Conference conducts
its fifth annual wrestling
championship Saturday, Feb
ruary 14, at Lamb-Miller
Field House on the campus of
Swarthmore College.
If successful, Dell will
become only the second wres
tler in conference history to
win four titles. He was the
champion at 158 pounds and

any closer than six points during
the first half and trailed at half
time, 32-22.
The Lions rallied behind
back-to-back 3-pointers by
Christine Curtin to cut the Bul
lets lead to 50-45 with seven
minutes to go in the game. The
Lady Bullets responded with a
fierce 12-2 run that put the game
away. Dravis finished the game
with 23 points, while Dawson
added 10 points and nine re
bounds to earn a spot on the all
tournament team. Steph Dravis
and Lauren Frankford chipped in
with 11 and nine points, respec
tively. The Lady Bullets (15-5, 8
3 in Centennial Conference)
were not quite as fortunate on
Tuesday night, as they were over
the weekend. Gettysburg trav
eled to Centennial Conference
leading Johns Hopkins Tuesday
and were handed a 71-49 loss.

for post-season
was voted the conference's most
outstanding wrestler as a fresh
man in 1994 before moving up
a weight class and earning back
to-back titles at 167 the past two
years. Dell, who has lost only
once in 31 matches this season
and was 6-0 in conference dual
meets, enters the conference
tournament as the top-ranked
Division III wrestler in the na
tion at 167 pounds.
The tournament will also
decide the team championship;
Gettysburg has never finished
higher than second or lower than
third. Ursinus is the two-time

defending champion, with the
Bullets winding up third behind
Ursinus and Western Maryland
a year ago.
Dell is not the only
former champion who will be
competing for Gettysburg on
Saturday. Senior Chris Clifford
won the 158-pound weight
class in 1996 as a sophomore.
He brings a 20-11 record to the

tournament in his bid to unseat
the defending 158-pound
champion, Donny Asper of
Ursinus.
Other Gettysburg wres
tlers who could be seeded first
or second in their weight class,
along with their overall and
conference dual records: senior
Jamie Binnall, 13-14, 5-1, at
118 pounds; junior Marty

Scarpato, 21-9, 5-0, at 126
pounds; senior Brad
McCutcheon, 9-8, 0-0, or
sophomore Andrew Buck, 10
8, 4-2, at 142 pounds; sopho
more Chris Beck, 12-15, 3-2,
at 150 pounds; senior James
Lobsenz, 16-14, 4-2, at 177
pounds; and freshman Brad
Baker, 10-7, 3-1, at 190
pounds.

The win for the Blue Jays
clinched a spot in the confer
ence playoffs for Johns
Hopkins, but the Lady Bullets
will have to win their remain
ing three conference games to
secure a spot in the playoffs.
Jen Dravis was the only
Lady Bullet in double figures
with 13 points. Courtney
Marotta added eight points,
while Steph Dravis scored
seven points.
The next game for the
Lady Bullets will be tonight
when the Dickinson Red Dev
ils come to Bream gymnasium.
This could also be a record set
ting night for the Lady Bullets.
Senior Jen Dravis only needs
nine more points to become the
fifth player in Gettysburg his
tory to score 1,000 points in
her career. Come out and sup
port the Lady Bullets in the
drive toward the playoffs to
night. The game begins at 7

Staff Writer The Gettysburg Bullets
Basketball team capped off the
week with an outstanding per
formance at Dickinson on Sat
urday night. After loosing a
vital game to F&M on Wednes
day at home, the Bullets trav
was
proved to be a do or die match
up. The Bullets entered the
game tied with Dickinson with
a 4-4 conference record. The
Bullets had defeated the Red
Devils earlier in the season 74
72 in a game that saw the
begining of a real hot streak for
the Bullets. They hoped the
same would happen on Satur
day night.

With sophomore ball
handler Ryan Napp on the
bench with a shoulder injury
and not available for the game,
the Bullets were short on guards

with varsity game experience.
When junior Jon Bowman
went down with an ankle in
jury with 13 minutes left in the

third period,
Coach Petrie
had to test the
depth of his
bench.
To fill
's
he used a com
bination of se
nior Co-Captian
John Bauersfeld
and first year
Carter Mecham.
Mecham had
been brought up
from the J.V.
team to backup
Bowman, and
both he and
Buaersfeld shined

when they got their chances.
Bauersfeld hit two three
pointers to spark the offensive
attack while Mecham played

the point of a solid zone de
fense. With great offensive
and defensive plays from se
nior Co-Captain Terry

The key for Gettysburg
was the combination of five
Gettysburg players with double
digit scoring along with the sec

on the season for the Bullets
with 12.

In team notes: sources
close to the team report that
first year guard Chris "Meat"
Collins may undergo treatment
for an apparent snoring prob
lem. Sources also report that
many Bullets complain of
Collin's problem on long bus
rides. Officially the Bullets had
no comment on the situation.

Emily Brown and Mitko Kuborov are leaving their mark on Gettysburg Track

Hammer Throw, and 35-lb.
Weight Mitko Koburov (also
known as Kube) is just one of
the many hard working athletes
that participates in indoor
track. "Kube" is an integral
part of the throwing squad as
well as the main entertainment
for the entire team.
Although Kube is not set
ting school records like team
mate Nate Grim, his absence
would surely be noticed. Kube
provides much needed points
for the total which helps Get
tysburg come out on top. He
says that the athletes, "use this
as an opportunity to prepare
for the spring track season."
And he is no exception.
He donates two hours a day
practicing followed by another
two hours of hard work in the
weight room.

The winter track season has ended, but that doesn't mean Beth Castagno is not gearing up
for spring.

Emily Brown is another
key component of the team.
She is a two-sport athlete that
sprints for the team. Her hard
work and dedication is sought
after by many members of the
team. Last year as a freshman,
Emily broke the school record
in the 400 meter hurdles. She
was also on the school record
breaking 4x100 meter relay
team. Brown was also on the

Lady Bullets soccer team which
went to the NCAA playoffs this
past fall.
Indoor Track allows an
extra two months for them to
perfect their technique and
work on their times for the
spring season. The atmosphere
is laid back and allows the ath
letes to have fun and enjoy each
other's company while work
ing hard to make themselves
better. The throwing team, in

particular is a close-knit group
that lifts, practices, and goes
out together.
The team, coached by
Robert Condon and John
Schmid, practices everyday
and participates in meets on
the weekends.
Although the indoor
track team does not have any
home meets, Kube, Emily and
the gang are eagerly awaiting
for the spring season and some
fan support.

pionships discus event with a
throw of 116_'11". In addition,
she broke Gettysburg's shot put
record whenshe was the event's
runner-up at Centennial's with
a distance of 3 8'2".
Both Coach Condon and
Coach Schmid are very opti
mistic about Cathy's possibili
ties at the upcoming indoor and
outdoor championships and for
the future. With Cathy's im
mense talent both coaches be
lieve she is a national-caliber
athlete. She even has an out
side chance at qualifying for the
National Championships in the
shot put this spring. Coach
Schmid_'s most immediate goal
for Spangler is to break the 40

- continued from page 23 -
foot barrier in the shot put.
"Cathy is a very talented, hard
working and coachable ath
lete," explained Schmid. "She's
learned a lot and she is still
learning."
Spangler has enormous
potential for even greater suc
cesses over the next few years.
For Cathy the most important
thing about track is that it is her
own "thing." "Everyone needs
to have one thing that is their
own thing," Spangler notes.
"You are missing out if you
don't have your one main
thing." For both Cathy Spangler
and Nathan Grim throwing is
their "one main thing." They
have consistently worked hard
to achieve their throwing goals
and it has paid off.

As Nathan comes to the
end of his collegiate career, he
strives to attain, for the last
possible time, his goals. He
pushes on towards the Na
tional championship and a
possible Ail-American status
with all the strength and de
termination he possesses.
Cathy, on the other hand, has
two and half years ahead of her
and a lot of room to live up to
her potential.
No matter what goals
they each have set and what
goals they attain, the most im
portant thing for both Grim
and Spangler is that they leave
Gettysburg with fond memo
ries of all they have achieved
and the friends they have
made.

youngster looking to dominate the Centennial Conference for years to come.

Player Profiler
Gettysburg College is
lucky to have two of the Cen
tennial Conference's most tal
ented throwers in their midst
senior Nathan Grim and
sophomore Cathy Spangler.
Ironically, both track and field
athletes are relatively hew to
their successes.
Nathan Grim began his
athletic career playing soccer
when he was 8 years old.
Throughout high school he
continued to play soccer and
began playing basketball as
well. In order to keep in shape
for soccer and basketball,
Nathan _decided to join the
track team in the spring. He
threw the javelin and the shot
put and also ran the quarter
mile.

A true athlete at heart _.
Grim knew his athletic career
would have to continue after
higljschool. Following a failed
attempt to join the soccer team
his first year, Nathan spoke
with his Wellness instructor and
track and field throws coach,
John Schmid. Coach Schmid
encouraged Nathan, who is
fondly known as Nate, to speak
with head coach Bob Condon
and to join the track team.
Nathan laughs, "I went to see
Coach Condon and he sent me
right to the weight room." The
265 pound Grim weighed only
200 pounds at the time, cer
tainly not enough to be a com
petitive thrower.
"I was a scrub as a fresh¬

man and was always getting
kicked around by everyone in
the conference," said Grim.
That soon changed. Grim is
very well versed in his throws.
Indoors he throws the shot put
and 35 lb. weight, outdoors, in
addition to the shot put, Grim
throws the discus and the ham
mer. "I really enjoy the synergy
between all the events and the
technique work in each helps
me in the other," commented
Grim. Nathan won his first col
legiate medal as a sophomore
during the indoor season, plac-

ing third in the shot put at the
Centennial Conference Cham
pionships. He repeated his
third place finish in the out
door season and then again in
the indoor season of his junior
year. Last spring Nathan broke
the Centennial Conference
record in both the shot put and
the discus. In addition he was
the Centennial Conference
Champion of both events.
Nathan also holds both
Gettysburg's indoor and out
door records in the shot put

as well as the hammer record.
A few weekends ago
Nathan qualified provisionally
for the National Champion
ships in the shot put with a
throw of 50' 2". This past
weekend he improved his
throw to 52'1", practically guar
anteeing him a spot at Nation
als- he is presently seeded fifth.
Nathan and his coaches are
hoping he will defend his Con
ference title and qualify for
Nationals in the spring as well.
According to Coach
Schmid, Nathan has great tech
nique. "Nate is a technician,"

photo by Emily _Glatfeller
said Schmid,,"He is practically
the assistant throws coach and
he has madehimself into every
thing he is today." In high
school Nathan struggled with
the shot put and didn't even
enjoy doing it, but since com
ing to college it has become a
huge focus in his life. "I've
learned if you do something
you truly enjoy and are able to
devote yourself to it willingly,
you will be rewarded," ex
plained Nathan, "In high school
I did stuff for my coaches, in

college, I did it for myself- be
cause I love it."
Nathan has had many
good people to push him to
where he is today. His parents,
Bruce and Kathleen, have been
excellent role models and have
constantly given Nathan en
couragement. When he was
growing up, Nathan's father
was very involved in his athlet
ics as a coach of his soccer
team. But more importantly to
Grim, his father has always
been a friend to him. Grim
greatly admires his mother,
who just recently went back to

school for her bachelors and
masters degrees. At Gettys
burg, Nathan is supported by
his fellow throwers who are his
best friends. He commented,
"I'm out there every day hav
ing a great time with my best
friends and no matter how bad
a mood I am in when I get to
practice, I always leave smil
ing." Cathy Spangler is another
thrower who is always smiling.
Like Nathan she has had won
derful people ' supporting her
along the way. Her mom,
Patricia, is a very special per
son who is very loving and sup
portive of both Cathy and her
brother. Talking about her
mother, Cathy commented,
"When you grow up with some
one like that, you know you'll
be okay."

The sophomore thrower
began her track and field career
as a junior in high school. "One
-

of the track coaches asked me
if I'd ever thrown before. I
hadn't, but I'd always wanted
to do something," Cathy ex
plained, "I tried it and I liked
it." Not only did Cathy like it,
but she was good at throwing
too. Cathy, who competes in
the shot put, 20 pound weight,
hammer and discus, is most
taken with the discus. "I love
throwing the discus because I
feel so graceful when I throw
it," she explained. "[The dis
cus] just flies and it makes me
feel good."
In high school, she held
the shot put relay record which
was over 110 feet. Since com
ing to Gettysburg, Cathy has
continued in her successes and
grown through them. In the
indoor season of her first year,
Spangler broke the school
record in the 20 pound weight
throw with a distance of 33'4"
Last spring Spangler won the
