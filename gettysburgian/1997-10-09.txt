Party on
Fight leads to police bust;
Sigma Alpha Epsilon still in
good standing

byDanLarkin
News Editor A large crowd and an in
cident involving a non-Gettysburg
College student caused Gettys
burg Borough Police to shut down
a party at the Sigma Alpha Epsi
lon (SAE) fraternity house early
Sunday morning.
According to the Gettys
burg Police Department, at around
2:20 am, a borough police car was
patrolling Lincoln Avenue, when
the officers observed some com
motion at the fraternity house.
The police stated that
they noticed a group of males
hoisting another male subject
above their heads. The patrol
stopped to investigate the situa
tion.

According to the police
department, a large crowd, of what
appeared to be about 150 people,
had gathered outside the house.
Members of the crowd were ap
parently acting disorderly, and
some began yelling obscenities at
the police.
The police stepped in to
calm down the situation, and the
party was shut down.
The male subject who
had been hoisted up by the group
was arrested for public drunken¬

ness. Richard Sursick, the ar
rested subject, was not a student
at Gettysburg College but a visit
ing student from Johns Hopkins
University.
Apparently, Sursick was

involved in an altercation during
the party, which led to the scene
outside the fraternity house.
According to Dennis
Murphy, Assistant Dean of the
College and Director of Greek
Organizations, the SAE brothers
"were having a dance, and a non
student started an altercation out
front, which is what caused the
disturbance."
Brian Murphy, presi
dent of the Gettysburg SAE
chapter, stated that "the problem
was with one of the people in
side the party. The police came
by because of the crowd, and shut
down the party."
Dean Murphy stated
that he felt that the SAE mem
bers "used good judgement" in
dealing with the situation.
The SAE fraternity re
turned to campus in 1996 after a
four-year suspension and is cur
rently undergoing a probationary
period where no alcohol is per
mitted in the house.

When asked if the inci
dent would have any effect on
SAE's probationary status, Dean
Murphy answered in the nega
tive. "The problem was not with
the event," he said.
According to Dean
Murphy, Gettysburg College Se
curity checked the house and
"were convinced that there was
no alcohol in the building."

Candle in the wind
Fire causes "moderate
damage " to two dorm rooms

byHenr yFawefl
StaffWriter In the late evening of
Sunday September 28, a small fire
broke out in a Musselman Hall
dorm room, causing moderate
damage to the student's second
floor room, as well as that of an
other student directly above.
The fire was quickly ex
tinguished by Safety & Security
before the Gettysburg Fire Depart
ment could arrive.
A lit candle, left on while
one of the inhabitants was sleep
ing in the room, was determined
as the cause of the fire.
Erin Lawson, the East
Wing Coordinator for Residence
Life, stated that the fire was "fairly
small and pretty well contained.
Not too much property was af
fected by the fire."

However, the student
was in violation of a Gettysburg
College rule which states that no
candles, incense, or other lighting
devices may be used in a dorm
room. Thus, the violation was the
cause of the fire and subsequent
damage to the student's belong
ings. Furthermore, the smoke
which filtered out of the room
through an open window ended up
causing minor damages to the
room directly above on the third
floor. The flames were con
tained in the second floor room
until Safety & Security could ar
rive and extinguish them but not

cerning the fire safety procedure
had arisen.
There was, in the mo
ments after the fire, an issue raised
concerning the reaction time of the
Gettysburg Fire Department.
It was said by many of
the dorm's residents that their ar
rival was surprisingly late. How
ever, Lawson stated that the Fire
Depar tment was already informed
that the flames had been extin
guished by the college security.
Furthermore the fire
alarms, one of which is installed
on every hall, did not sound. The
student sleeping the room was not
awakened until she heard a friend
banging on her door. In fact, the
alarms were not heard throughout
the dorm until they had to be
pulled manually.
The student sleeping, who
requested that her name not be
published, said that she "was very
upset the fire alarms did not go
off."

As for the damage, nei
ther of two residents was harmed,
but hard drive damage was done
to two computers in the room.
Both are in need of significant re
pair. Minor damages were done
to other pieces of private property.
Up until this past Sunday, the en
tire room was covered in soot,
making it uninhabitable.
The students who lived in
there stayed in a friend's room this
past week. They were, however,
offered other alternatives by the
school.

functioning - even though they
had no symptoms yet.
Some 92 patients had prob
lems with their aortic ormitral
heart valves, the report said. The
FDA said the numbers were much
higher than it had expected,
prompting it to recommend stop
ping sales.
Dionne said she has stopped
taking the drug but only had one
week left to take it anyway. She
said she's not worried about devel
oping any heart problems later.
"If the FDA determined it
was unsafe, then it should be taken
off the market. I don't feel sick,
but I did stop taking the drug just
to be on the safe side," Dionne
said. Trujillo said the popularity
of fen-phen was a tragedy waiting
to happen. He said last year, car
diologists from University Hos
pital in Denver had met to discuss
the and possible problems.

The popular diet drug com
bination known as fen-phen has
been pulled off the market, and ,
despite warnings form doctors,
some people aren't worried about
developing heart problems.
"I have had no side effects,"
said Melinda Dionne, a 30-year
old University of Colorado student
who has taken the drug for the past
four months. "I feel strong. I
could run three miles today if I
wanted to."
Despite how she may feel,
cardiologists and nutritionists are
apprehensive about possible long-

term side effects caused from the
drug. "Remember, high blood
pressure can develop very
quickly," cardiologist Nelson
Trujillo warned. "The truth is, we
have no way of knowing how long
someone has to be on this drug
before they develop problems."
The Food and Drug Admin
istration last week pulled Redux,
known chemically as
dexfenfluramine, and Pondimin,
known chemically as
fenfluramine, after the drugs were
linked to serious heart damage.

Fenfluramine is half of the
popular diet drug combination fen
phen. The other half, phentermine,
was not affected by the FDA ban.
The FDA asked manufac
tures to stop sales of the drugs af

Some American doctors
were apprehensive about prescrib

Application deadline for 1998 Spring semester is October 15, 1997

"Town meeting" addresses issues

From Staff Reports
The Thursday, October 2
Common Hour forum featured the
first "Gettysburg College Town
Meeting" of the 1997-8 academic
year. The town meeting is a New
England tradition, where every
member of the community is in
vited to raise questions and voice
concerns.
The College began holding
the town meetings last year, in a
show of effort to provide a forum
for student concerns.
Last year's town meetings
featured heated debate and hostil
ity over controversial issues.
Perhaps due to a low turn
out, the atmosphere of last week's
forum was decidedly more sub
dued. However, a few important
issues were raised.

Abigail Rodgers, President
of Student Senate and Gettysburg
College President Gordon
Haaland, fielded questions and
comments from students concern
ing the College community.
Abbey Rodgers began the
meeting by introducing many of
the campus student leaders in at
tendance to the audience.
Rodgers then introduced
what she considered to be the two
main goals of the Student Senate
this semester. The first goal, she

stated is "alternative social pro
gramming." As an example of this,
Rodgers spoke of the recent
BYOB Shrimpfest.
The second goal of Senate,
Rodgers referred to as "aggressive
outreach programming." This pro
gram, which she also referred to
as "Senate in your face," which
aims to create a more active rela
tionship between the Senate and
the student body.
President Haaland spoke of
bringing together the various areas

One of our
problems, as a
college, is to find
things that bring us
together"
President Haaland
of the college community. This,
he said, would "enhance students'
lives beyond the classroom."
Haaland and Rodgers then
opened the forum up for questions
and comments from the audience.
Many of the issues raised at
the meeting reiterated student con
cerns from last year.
The first question raised ad
dressed the issue of Easter Break.
Provost Dan DeNicola fielded the

question, stating that while the cal
endar does provide a day off on the
Monday following Easter, students
requiring travel time for the obser
vation of Easter and all religious
holidays, are encouraged to speak
with their professors concerning
the issue.
A student representing Stu
dents for Ethical Action questioned
the College's policy of denying fi
nancial aid to international stu
dents whowish to study abroad.
Haaland denied the student's
accusations of the policy being dis
criminatory, but stated that the
policy is "currently under review."
When asked how he felt
about the all campus BYOB par
ties, Haaland said that they are "a
very good idea... One of our prob
lems, as a college," he stated, "is
to find things that bring us to
gether."

This issue of alcohol and al
cohol-related violence occupied
the remainder of the discussion.
Dean of the College Julie Ramsey
stated that "the correlation be
tween alcohol and assault is nearly
one hundred percent. . . By re
ducing the amount of students who
abuse alcohol, we will reduce the
amount of assaults."
President Haaland added
that "we as a college have been
struggling, and will continue to
struggle with the issue of alcohol
and assault."

Two clubs were granted
official Senate Recognition.
Women's Rugby and Habitat for
Humanity were both recognized.
Bacchus, a non-senate
sponsored organization, appeared
before the Senate to ask for its fi
nancial support. The dollar
amount asked for was $680, for the
purposes of sending to students to
a training course. Bacchus argued
that they could bring their knowl
edge gained through the training
back to campus, and provide the
school with new ideas about social
life. After some debate, the
Senate voted in favor of the pro
posal and granted Bacchus the
money requested.

DRUG BAN

continued from p 3
scribed the combination.
"There has never been an
effective pill for weight loss,"
Turjillo said about the popularity
of the drug. "In the short term,
this drug showed substantial
weight loss quickly. It is in the
American mentality to think,
'Why exercise and eat well when
you can take a pill?"
Wardenburg
DieticianColleen Betas said she
never recommended the combina
tion either.
"We had a lot of requests
for it last spring, mostly from fac
ulty and staff," Betas said. "As a
nutritionist, I tried to discourage
them from it. I've never felt good
to have a society of pill-seekers,"
Betas said she encourages a
healthy diet and exercise.

Before going on the com
bination, Dionne had to enroll in
a nutrition class at Access Medi
cal Weight Management in Den
ver, the clinic where she got the
drug. Access Medical has since
stopped prescribing fen-phen and
has returned to giving patients
plain appetite suppressants,
sources there say.
The controversy over fen
phen arose after doctors at the
Mayo Clinic announced in July
they had discovered 24 cases of
a rare heart-valve defect in
women who took fen-phen.
Symptoms included short
ness of breath, chest pain, faint
ing, swollen ankles and legs and
sometimes a heart murmur.

Prescriptions of the drugs
have plunged since the first warn
ing was issued.

Gettysburg serenaded by new a cappella group

byMdodieFoster StaffWriter

Features
Instruments? We don't need no stinkin' instruments

Gettysburg does not have
a great history of a cappella on
campus. In fact, says senior En
glish major Jonathan Blake, "the
history is that there is no his
tory." Many college campuses,
especially large universities,
support groups which perform a
cappella, meaning without in
strumental accompaniment.
Northwestern University's
award-winning group, Melodi
ous Thunk (a play on the name
of musician Thelonius Monk),
has performed nationwide and
puts out a compact disc every
year. Though there have been
no such groups of this caliber at
Gettysburg, some smaller ones
have been attempted, but did not
get far due to a lack of resources
and/or organization. It is not as

though the idea has never been sug
gested; it's just never come to frui
tion. History is about to change.
First-year students Jenny Bland and
Doug Walsh have, in three weeks,
put together what is looking to be
the first coed a cappella group on
campus in a long time, if not ever.
The group does not yet have
a name, as Bland and Walsh wanted
the members to decide on one to
gether.
Unable to gain the support of
the Music Department in their en
deavor, Bland and Walsh went to the
Student Activities Council in order
to get an advisor, which would al
low them to be an official part of
campus activities, get funding, and
reserve a practice space.
Lynn White Cloud has offered
to serve as a temporary advisor for
the semester, but the group is still
looking for someone to permanently
fill the position.

Well advertised, the group
had a turnout of about 35 inter
ested people to the series of audi
tions held September 22nd, 23rd,
and 24th in the CUB Ballroom.
Callbacks took place on Wednes
day, October 8, where eighteen
"We want to
do songs
people know."
singers competed for between nine
and sixteen spots.
After the member are se
lected, Walsh and Bland hope to
have practice twice a week for two
hours in the Ballroom. Though
more of the auditioners were fe
male, the two founders hope to
form a group that has an equal
male to female ratio.

This will also be an experi
enced group, as many of the stu
dents who auditioned are also in
College Choir.
Walsh and Bland were both
active in a cappella groups at
their high schools. Bland received
her inspiration for forming the
group from her high school mu
sic teacher, a woman who pushed
Bland and two other students to
love music and to lead others in
this pursuit.
Walsh came to Gettysburg
this fall with the intention of start
ing a group.
"I wanted to be a pioneer,"
commented Walsh. "When I vis
ited, I didn't get the impression
that the college had an a cappella
group, and I felt that they needed
one. It's a great way to add spirit."
And add spirit it certainly
will. As it is not associated with
the Music Department, the group
will have a different repertoire

than the College Choir.
Most of the arrangements
will be supplied by Bland's high
school music teacher, and will in
clude a wide variety of music:
from pop to ballads to oldies to
barber shop quartets.
"Our goal is to have a di
verse repertoire," says Walsh. "We
want to do songs people know."
More than anything else, the
purpose of the group is pure en
joyment of music. It is made up
of people who love music, love to
perform, and want to share this
with an audience. Says Blake, "A
cappella is a great way for people
to get together and do something
fun." No performances have been
scheduled as of yet, but the two
people behind the idea hope, de
pending on the group and the prac
tice schedule, to be ready to give
the campus a taste of a cappella
by winter.

Roosters isn t worth crowing about

by Kathleen Gr eely
Staff writer If you missed the recent
production of Roosters, you
missed the best play performed
at Gettysburg in a long time.
You did not however, miss
the best performance of a play.
Roosters is a contempo
rary play about pride, faith and
familial relationships. Written
by Milcha Sanchez-Scott, it is an
emotional play that can be
deeply moving--if properly per
formed.
Although the crew was
able to create a magnificent
stage, the actors were often un
able to fulfill their part in the
production, due in part, to bad
directing from George
Muschamp.

The stage design by
Jerome Hanson, complete with
on-stage seating, was one of the
best sets to ever go up in Kline
Theater. However, it was not
enough to make up for the
shoddy performances given by

most of the actors.
The Shadows, played by
Mary Cordero, Mike Ferrer, Jeffrey
Jones and Glen Beck, who haunted
the teenage daughter, Angela, were
not even remotely frightening or
threatening.
Audience members could
barely make out many of the lines
delivered by Gallo, the father, and
Adan, a neighbor who is in love with
Juana, played by Rob Thompson
and Paul Lapato, respectively. Their
weak stage presence and flimsy ac¬

cents, coupled with an overzeal
_^^^^^^ ous sound staff
_^^^^^^^. that

turned _^^IfH
on the music too _'
soon and too loud, ru
ined any chance for a
meaningful perfor
mance.

Chata, the prostitute/aunt,
played by Megan Manthey, was
not nearly as sassy and snappy as
she should have been. As a result,
much of the humor that was writ
ten into this character was lost.
Alec Beekmans and Phil
Anderson, who danced the parts
of the actual roosters, were a ben
eficial addition to the production,
however, their dance was silly and
unrealistic, more the fault of bad

choreography by Paula
_^ _k Kellinger than bad
¦ _U acting.
_HB The pivotal
_^^ role of Hector, the
_^B family's son, was
_F played by freshman
_^_k Dav e Shoffner.
^¦Though
_^m his accent _^ k
W came and >A _^^
* w e n t_^l_^^H
through- _J_^^^_f
out the _^^^^_T
performance, ^^F
Shoffner's perfor
mance was a solid one.

The best performances,
though, were given by Samantha
Gregg and Jennifer MacMurtie.
Gregg played the mother,
Juana, who is frustrated by her life
but tries to keep her fueding fam
ily together. Although her Span
ish accent could have been better,
Gregg's acting, particularly in her
second act monologue, was pow
erful and convincing.
The most difficult role, and
the best per- / _^^-
formed, was that L_^_f_^_r
of Angela, played I_^R_^_aP_^r

by MacMurtie
freshman. An
gela is

the confused
teenage
daughter who
has tea parties

with saints, longs to be a child
again, fears of dying from neglect,
and wants desperately to have a
complete family. Though the char
acter spends a large part of the play
hiding under the porch of the fam
ily home, MacMurtie's ability still
shines through.
Although it was unclear
what happened to her character in
the final scene (the whole final
scene itself is confusing),
MacMurtie's performance was the
saving grace of Roosters.
In the end, it is the poor di
rection of Muschamp that ruins
Sanchez-Scott's play. The move
ment of the actors on stage was
unnatural; their actions were far
too deliberate. The presence of the
grandfather, played by Jeremy
Katz, was not a part of the origi
nal script and was unnecessary in
this production and often proved
to be a distraction.

Poor directing, bad chore
ography, and a lack of preparation
turned a great play into an often
painful performance.

A movie not to be wished for

byJonFr oehlich
StqffWriter "Something is going on here
- something bad," proposes char
acter Alex Amberson.
"I wish I wasn't in this the
ater." Though this prayer will
prove quite useless and ineffec
tive, viewers of Wishmaster will
probably find it irresistible to give
it a try just for kicks.

Death Angel, Toy Soldiers), is under
standably a little upset so is out to take
over the world as we know it.
The Djinn then proceeds to pa
rade around for the next hour in a
(theoretically) scary get-up that looks
as if it were made by a forgetful
mother in the waning moments before
Halloween night.
Since the legend dictates that
the Djinn must first gain the power
of human souls through the
_^^^^ granting of their wishes,
PjjOl much of the movie involves
maKm the Djinn performing
Pg|| overly gory sideshow
S&_^ft stunts (most of which will

_u_$*5i laugh rather than a scare)
mjjmpl in response to what he

K§|_i the person who woke him
ByjJi| (Alex), the Djinn is con
'
imjjm stantly stalking the movie's
_KPraii main character.

The plot of
Wishmaster really speaks
for itself. Full of cheap plot
twists and uncreative dia
logue, Director Robert

Kurtzman (The Demolitionist)
doesn't offer audiences much to get
excited about.
Even though Wishmaster
will often be advertised under the
name of Wes Craven, audiences
shouldn't be fooled. The director
of such horror movies as Scream
and The People Under the Stairs
is only one many producers of
Wishmaster. Many of the movies
made by Wes Craven and other di
rectors like him are enjoyably
frightening because of smart plots
and classic characters. The only

thing scary about Wishmaster is
that someone was actually paid to
make it.
Though many of the above
criticisms of this movie are some
times what make horror movies fun
to watch and have earned them
their place in cinema culture,
Wishmaster just seems to take it
self too seriously. While it might
have fit in well about ten years ago,
when many others of its kind were
popular, audiences will most likely
be let down by how much
Wishmaster fails to compare to
movies of the horror and thriller
genre.

Get a Clue

byGlenBeck StaffWriter "It's a matter of life
after death; now that he's
dead, I have have life."
This is only one of the
many hilarious lines from
the 1985 movie based on
the Parker Brothers board
game, Clue. Directed by
Jonathan Lynn, the film
provides joke after joke
and gag after gag, that will
keep you laughing until the
credits.
The gala of stars in
clude Eileen Brennan
(Mrs. Peacock), Tim Curry
(Wadsworth), Madeline
Kahn (Mrs. White), Chris
topher Lloyd (Prof. Plum),
Michael McKean (Mr.
Green), Martin Mull (Col.
Mustard), and Lesley Ann
Warren (Miss Scarlett).

The talented comic
actors maneuver well
through the dialogue. The
quick pacing allows for

rolling laughs. An example of this
comes as Miss Scarlett and Prof.
Plum drive up to the scary Hill
House. "Why is the car stopped?"
asks Miss Scarlett. "It's fright
ened," replied Prof. Plum.
Besides very witty dialogue,
there is also a large amount of
physical humor in the movie.
Something very original
about the film is the three endings
that are included on the video.
Originally, different endings were
shown in different theaters, but on
the video, all three are included.
Wayne's World spoofs the
idea at the end of the film with their
own endings such as the "Scooby
Doo ending" and the "incredibly
happy ending."
Although there are a couple
of plot holes, the movie is a sure
laugh fest. The more times you
watch it, the more you'll pick up.
But you should be warned:
if a friend asks to borrow Clue,
she's probably asking for the
movie, not the board game.

El Nino predicts future weather

byStephBusch GECO Columnist
El Nino, a change in wind
direction which in turn changes the
weather conditions throughout the
entire world, occurs every three to
seven years. It is believed by many
scientists that this year's El Nino
may be one of the strongest ever.
What does this mean
for students here at
Gettysburg? Well, most
likely this year's winter will
be more mild than previous
years, and instead of a great
deal of snow, we will see
rain.

The effects of El Nino
vary for different parts of the
world. When the westward
blowing trade winds
weaken, it allows a mass of
warm water, which is nor
mally located off Australia,
to move eastward to western
South America.
The unusually warm
water acts on the jet stream
patterns which in turn alter

weather worldwide.
Most likely El Nino will
cause droughts in Australia and
Southeast Asia, as well as flood
ing in the Southern portion of the
United States.
Along the mideast and
northeast portions of the United
States, there will most likely be
mild winters and rain instead of
snow. It is difficult to pinpoint the
exact effects of El Nino because

of the many factors that can con
tribute to weather change.
The change in weather will
not only effect our everyday
lives, but will also have an effect
on animals.
For example, along the
coast of California, some marine
species are seen in greater abun
dance because of the warmer

ocean water, which is beneficial
for the fisheries.
However, there are some
species that depend on the sea
son changes and the cooler wa
ter temperatures. These species
may suffer from the mild winter
Fortunately, because El
Nino is a natural occurrence,
many animals are able to adjust
or adapt to the weather changes
without too many natural distur
bances.
Some scientists believe

that El Nino will have a great ef
fect on weather world-wide, while
other scientists acknowledge El
Nino, but feel it is difficult to pre
dict what is exactly going to oc
cur. Many effects have been seen
already throughout the world. In
fact, Indonesia is currently plagued
with severe droughts. These
droughts can effect crop

yield and production,
leading to economic tur
moil and distress.
It is therefore un
derstandable why El
Nino has become such a
controversial and talked
about issue, due to its
effects on not only the
environment but the
economy as well.
The El Nino that
is currently affecting the
world's weather condi
tions is one and a half
times the size of the
United States, and is still

growing.
However, knowing that El
Nino could have a severe effect on
certain areas, it allows govern
ments and individuals to plan far
the weather changes. Having this
information can save millions of
dollars in repairs for certain geo
graphical areas.

Thursday at 7 p.m. in the base
ment of Plank gym. Everyone is
welcome!!!

Dear Casey...

Dear Casey,
A few weekends ago, I
was at a party and ended up
getting pretty drunk. I had
come with a bunch of friends,
but in the morning, I woke up
on the floor of this strange
place instead of in my own
bed. My friends had ditched
me there after I had passed
out. I was lucky that nothing
happened, but I can't believe
that my friends totally ditched
me, leaving me in a potentially
dangerous situation. They

don't seem to think that this
is a big deal, but I feel betrayed
and angry. I think that is only
fair. What do you think?
Thanks,
Upset
Dear Upset,
Well, did your friends force
you to drink or get completely
wasted? Probably not. When you
drink you should realize that YOU
are putting yourself in a potentially
dangerous situation to begin with,
especially if all the friends with you
are getting drunk as well.

Now, the fact that your
friends ditched you is rather disturb
ing. They should have seen what
you are doing, and stuck around to
make sure you got out okay.
It seems that we often depend
upon our friends to take care of us
when we are drinking; we put an
awful lot of responsibility on their
shoulders.
This leads me to surmise that
the problem does not lie solely in
the hands of your friends. I sup pose
that if they were sober they would
not have left you. But, when alco
hol is involved, fears, worries, and
concerns are usually left behind in
an empty bottle.
No, I would not completely
blame your friends, or yourself.
Instead, I would blame the lack of
education on alcohol awareness.
People either do not know, or do not
care. Efforts are being made to in
crease awareness, and I would sug
gest that you get involved and help
to spread the word.

Dear Casey,
I have a problem. One oi
my friends has been skipping
a lot of classes. He seems to
do his work, but he just never
seems to make it to class. I
am beginning to worry, but I
do not want to be his mother
and nag him. I have to do
something, but what?
Thanks,
Worried
Dear Worried,
I think that often people do
not tend to realize how important it
is to go to class. When someone
gets into the habit of not going to
class, it is like the potato chip syn
drome-you know, you can never
have just one. The same pertains to
class attendance, or lack thereof.
After all, is there nothing sweeter
than sleeping in until one or two
o'clock on a weekday? Yes, a high
GPA.

I do understand your fear of
the "mother syndrome," which
seems to be a popular trend in col
lege. This can be good and bad. It
is good because it lets people know
that someone cares, but it is bad
because isn't the reason we came to
college to get away from our moth
ers? The last thing we want is to
be nagged. Something you can do
for your friend is encourage him to
go to class, and whatever you do,
don't enable him.
Be a friend and mention your
concern without being pushy. Just
say, "Look buddy, I am concerned
about you, but in the long run, you
are the only one that is going to be
hurt." And it is true, he is.
However, some people are
stubborn, and he might just not lis
ten to you. If this happens, don't
be offended.

You are right: you can't be his
mother, and you can't ground him,
send him to his room, or more im
portantly, send him to class.

Conflict and Consensus —
From The Donkey's Mouth
On Being A Democrat

byLibbyMain
Contributing Writer
The other contributors to this
column and the writer of its Re
publican antithesis have chosen to
discuss issues of national political
importance. They have avoided
discussion that is first person in na
ture, but I really wasn't comfort
able scanning the papers for the
newest political scandal or trying
to understand the difference be
tween the latest Republican and
Democratic plans for campaign fi
nance reform. Belonging to a po
litical party isn't just about identi
fying with party leaders or issues
on a national or abstract level. I
feel that it is beneficial to think
about political issues on a more
personal basis and I hope that some
people will be able to identify with

me. I, for example, could not
visit the extremely impoverished

area of Sandtown-Winchester in
Baltimore without developing the
belief that the government needs
to do something about economic
and psychological poverty. Could
you walk through the abandoned
houses filled with garbage that in
cludes dirty needles, filthy play
pens and moth eaten clothing
crawling with bugs and feel that
public housing was adequate? If
you were given a tour of the com
munity center and were able to
meet people who benefitted from
improvements provided by Federal
Empowerment Zone status would
you think they didn't deserve wel
fare? If you knew that there was
a decrease in the high school drop
out rate as a result of a tutoring
program, a decrease in the teen
pregnancy rate as a result of coun
seling efforts, and increased com
munity involvement and civic
pride in the neighborhood as a re
sult of the comprehensiveness of

the services provided could you be
indifferent. Would you want Con
gress to take money away from
them? In addition, would you per
sonally want to witness the execu
tion by lethal injection of a person
who vehemently professed their
innocence through countless ap
peals and interrogations?
What would you do if a
member of your family was in a
devastating car accident which left
them in a vegetative, brain dead
state for more than four months?
If the doctors prognosis was for no
recovery _, your family was grow
ing increasingly upset and drained
from seeing the relative hooked
up to respirators and heart moni
tors day after day, and the finan
cial cost of the care was becoming
unbearable would you still respect
the Supreme Courts ruling against
active voluntary euthanasia?
How would you feel if you

were completely qualified and able
to do a job but you could not be
hired because you are wheelchair
bound and the company's office
building has not conformed to fed
eral accessibility standards leaving
you unable even to enter the build
ing? Would you appreciate the
current right to procure an abor
tion if one of your good friends
from High School was violently
raped? In response to Republicans
who would say that these are
highly emotional examples of the
individual effects political issues,
these cases do exist whether or not
they are in the minority. We must
realize that every government de
cision no matter how minor its
seems has moral, social, economic,
and personal repercussions. In
addition, Republicans would argue
that people should take care of
themselves and one another and

leave the government out of these
issues. However, the government
has a responsibility to protect the
liberties of all citizens and is able
to provide more funding and uni
versal enforcement for implement
ing policies.
A final note-don't be de
pressed or upset about the situa
tions I have described! Act on
them! Go to Sandtown-Winches
ter with the Center for Public Ser
vice, protest the death pena 'lty,
write a living will, make sure the
buildings in your town are handi
capped accessible, or join the Na
tional Organization of Women here
on campus! Democrats tend to
take a more optimistic approach
towards change and political ac
tion than their Republican coun
terparts but I realize you don't have
to be a Democrat to have a social
conscience; you just have more
sympathetic company within your
party if you are.

The Pachyderm's Pulpit
Race and the Republican Party

byJohnDunlap
StaffWriter Not Since before the New
Deal have Republicans been able
to maintain control of the Con
gress for more than one term.
Just by holding on to power on
Capitol Hill, republicans showed
that 1994 was not a fluke, that
there was and is some type of re
alignment occurring on the
American political map. Repub
licans however, hold a tentative
control of the House of Represen
tatives as they did lose seats in
last year's election. Speaker of
the House Gingrich's majority is
very thin, as some moderate Re
publicans got the boot last No
vember.
Republicans controlling
the Congress is no easy thing,
considering the GOP can not even
compete in virtually every minor
ity district in America. African-

Americans vote Democratic in
overwhelming numbers, and while
GOP support grows in many sec
tors, Hispanics who were divided
over President Ronald Reagan in
1984 voted solidly against the Re
publican Nominee for President
last year, former Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole. While the Re
publican stance on immigration
and affirmative action played well
in GOP constituencies it hurt the
Republican ticket from President
on down when it came to expand
ing the party.
President Clinton's slogans
on issues like affirmative action,
such as "Mend it but do not bend
it," were able to attract white sub
urban voters while holding on to
the Democrats base of minorities.
I am not saying that the Republi
can stance on race related issues
is wrong or that Republicans
should ride the fence like our yo¬

yo President, all I am saying is that
Republicans should go into minor
ity neighborhoods and begin a con
versation.
Republicans from the Civil
War to the New Deal were known
as the party who liberated African
Americans from the shackles of
slavery. Reconstruction created a
new type of slavery and fear of
Democrats kept Blacks voting Re
publican. In 1924, the Democratic
National Convention lasted over
two weeks because Democrats
were fighting over criticisms of the
Klu Klux Klan. No matter what
Republicans did they had voters of
color in their pocket.
President Franklin
Roosevelt changed that and he cre
ated a Democrat majority in
America made up of a great coali
tion of labor unions, southern
whites, the poor, and minorities.
Liberals bravely led the charge for

the Civil Rights movements in the
sixties and by 1968 Republicans
could not even compete for minori
ties. The Reagan Revolution
passed over black communities
despite rising standards of living
among African-Americans. Presi
dent George Bush tried to reach
out but things like Willie Horton
kept him from sounding sincere.
President Clinton, on the
other side of the political aisle has
remained popular among a broad
range of minorities, but not be
cause of things which he has done.
For instance, under his administra
tion affirmative action is dying, he
signed the Republican Welfare re
form Bill, which was bitterly op
posed by minority Democrats in
the Congress, and he has moved
the Democratic party rightward. In
doing all of this, he has run con
trary to the wishes of top Black
Democrats like Reverend Jesse

Jackson, who has not had a warm
relationship with the President.
This gives Republicans an
excellent opportunity to talk to
Black voters about their issues and
concerns. Jack Kemp tried to do
that as Bob Dole's running mate
last year but he received little help.
Republicans must talk about how
affirmative action hurts minorities.
In the business I worked at over the
summer my boss was a young
black woman, at first, I wondered
is she had gotten her position be
cause of race or gender prefer
ences. You know what, I came to
soon discover that she was an in
telligent, highly competent leader
who could get things done. She
earned the respect of everyone
working beneath her, white, black
and Asian. I know I was not alone
see PACHYDERM, pg. 11

Racism Does Exist...

in my thinking, and it cheapened
what she had accomplished be
cause of government programs that
are supposed to help.
Racial quotas pit people
against one another and
demagogue's excuses for why
white people lose jobs. When quo
tas were enacted under the Nixon
Administration by the National
Civil Rights Commission they
were a noble idea but they have
failed, they are in my opinion, un
constitutional and unfair. They
have lost their, under our current
system racial preferences would
benefit Eddie Murphy above a
poor white man in Adams County.
That is not right. Today everyone
fits into a quota except white males
and when you single one group out
like that it only encourages hate
and racism. Reverend Martin
Luther King, Jr. and Vice President
Hubert Humprey did not fight for
quotas, they battled for a color
blind society and that should be our
goal as a nation.

There should exist scholar
ships to help all poor people to re
ceive a decent education and Re

Continued from page 10
publicans must talk about how they
are for school choice and vouch
ers, which help the poor, and in
ner-city children. No child should
be should be stuck in a bad school
and the GOP attempt to give
vouchers to District of Columbia
residents does not help country
club Republicans from suburban
New Jersey, it helps the poor black
child who is afraid to go to school
in urban D.C.
Republican candidates for
office must go into the cities and
talk about how Mayor Guilliani's

way of fighting crime, not the lib
eral way used by his failed prede
cessor David Dinkins has worked.
The Republican way should be
tried all across America. In Wash
ington, Mayor Marion Barry has
hopped onto the Republican band
wagon endorsing voluntary school
prayer and the death penalty. The
old way of government checks
does not work in today's society.
Racism does exist; the Los
Angeles riots and the Simpson
Trial showed that. Resentment and
hate are out there and a true con
servative should stand up for all

individuals, minorities, women,
and homosexuals all included.
Not for preferential treatment but
for equal right. It has only been
thirty years since African-Ameri
cans were given by law their true
equal rights with the Civil Rights
Act and the Voting Rights Act.
Hate and discrimination will al
ways exist, but a true two-party
debate among minorities can
open a lot of minds on all sides.
In 1994, Ellen Sauerbrey
was defeated for Governor of
Maryland by about two-tenths of

one percent. She ignored 25% of
the state, the African-Americans
because she felt there was no way
of winning them over and she
only received 7% of their support.
Mrs. Sauerbrey is campaigning
again for Maryland's top office,
and this time she is talking to
black voters, and while most are
not joining her on her campaign,
they are listening. When you look
around urban Baltimore, Phila
delphia, or Washington then it is
obvious that the old liberal way
of governing America's cities just
does not work.

Consider this

This week Gettysburg
College's sidewalks were covered
with the names of various histori
cal, literary, and pop-culture fig
ures. These names were written in
preparation for National Coming
Out Day this week.
Many questions are raised
by the presence of these names.
Are all of these figures homo- or
bisexual? Or did they only sup
port the right to an alternative
lifestyle?
Should the names of former
first ladies, great authors, and tal
ented artists be labeled in such an
ambiguous manner?
While many of the names
chalked on sidewalks throughout
campus represent openly homo
sexual or bisexual figures, the
sexual orientation of many is only
based upon speculation, conjec
ture, and rumor.
But while the homosexual¬

ity or bisexuahty of these iconic
figures of our past and present may
be questionable, the motivation
behind the chalkings is not.
The objective behind the
sidewalk writings was to show the
campus community that alternative
sexual lifestyles are neither a new
phenomenon nor the life choice of
an isolated minority.
Far too often, homosexuals
and bisexuals are portrayed in our
culture as people who do not fit in
or do not have a place within main¬

stream society.
But as the names chalked on
the walks tiiis week attest, gays,
lesbians, and bisexuals number
among the greatest that human so
ciety has had to offer throughout
the history ofthe world.
Try to imagine American lit
erature without the contributions of
Walt Whitman or Herman
Melville. Or American political
history without Alexander
Hamilton or Elanor Roosevelt. Or
the renaissance without Leonardo
DiVinci.
Together, the people repre
sented by the names chalked
throughout campus form a piece of
human history so substantial that
history is unfathomable and inco
herent without them.
Those who wrote the names
of these figures across the campus
have provided an invaluable ser
vice to the Gettysburg College
community.

The students, faculty, and
administration of the College are
frequently in need cf a wake-up
call. In this seemingly homoge
neous campus, it is far too easy to
assume that homosexuals and bi
sexuals are an insignificant and
negligible part ofthe community.
The names on the sidewalks
make us question our assumptions
and realize that sexual minorities
are a valuable part of our cultural
history and important people in our
own lives.

Conflict and Consensus

An Open Letter to the Campus

Thank you to all the volunteers who helped make the
Fiesta a tiemendous success again this year Your lifting
cooking, serving, playing, patrolling and celebrating
contributed to joy for literally thousands of others.
Without your hard work an essential part of our
relationship with the community that surrounds us could
not have taken place. We hope the hard work and its

significance was rewarding for you

by Erin Patterson and Kevin
Howard
Public Relations Chair Panhel and
IFC If you missed any of the ac
tion this past week, here is a recap
of all of the events from Greek
Week, and the winners of each

event. On Saturday, the entire
Greek system pulled together and
participated in the annual Greek
GIV day. There were over 120
men and women present represent
ing the Gettysburg's Greek system
participating in community service
all over town. On Sunday the
Scavenger Hunt made its official
return to Greek Week with a huge
success. There were Greeks all
over campus searching frantically
for objects as random as an Illinois
drivers license to #97 at Pizza
House. For the women, Chi
Omega finished first, Alpha Delta
Pi finished second and Delta
Gamma came in third. As for the
men, Sigma Nu came in first, Al
pha Chi Rho finished second and
Sigma Alpha Epsilon came in
third.

Bed races was the next event
on the agenda and it was as comi
cal as was expected. Some beds
made it, while most others had
some minor flaws, like falling
apart. Theta Chi won this event
easily with in our opinion the best
bed we have ever seen raced, while
Sigma Nu and Fiji came in second
and third respectively. As for the
women, Delta Gamma came in
first with Chi Omega and Alpha
Delta Pie finishing behind them.
On Tuesday, we enjoyed the
rain shortened Greek Carnival
while it lasted. Booths were set up
by most organizations with themes
like: A-D-Pie in your face, a fiesta
theme, dart game, bobbing for
apples, or a goldfish toss. Sigma
Nu and Gamma Phi Beta came
away with most creative booths
and earned extra points.

Wednesday was the Greek
Olympics competition with four
events comprising the days activi
ties. The dizzy bat race led off the
festivities with the usual laughs,
but Alpha Tau Omega wasn't
laughing as they led the way to first
place, while Sigma Alpha Epsilon
and Fiji followed. For the women,

Chi Omega came in first with
Gamma Phi and Delta Gamma fin
ishing behind them. The egg race
followed and created a little mess
in Stine Lake. The object of this
race was to run across Stine Lake
with an egg balanced on a spoon.
Phi Sigma Kappa managed to win
this event with Alpha Tau Omega
and Theta Chi finishing second and
third. Alpha Delta Pi finished first
while Gamma Phi and Delta
Gamma followed.
Following the egg race, the
three-legged race began. Aside
from a few broken ropes, the race
went well. Fiji came in first with

Crow and Phi Psi following. As
for the women, Delta Gamma won
the race with Chi Omega and
Gamma Phi right behind them.
Finally, the grand finale for the day
was the much anticipated tug-of
war. To say that Alpha Tau Omega
was pumped up for this years com
petition is an understatement.
They ran away with the competi
tion and with the rope, literally.
Phi Psi finished second and Crow
finished third. As for the women,
Alpha Delta Pi pulled their way
into first while Gamma Phi and
Delta Gamma finished in second
and third.

Mud Volleyball was another
awesome day in Greek Week.
Aside from random dives in the
quarry, the event was great. For
the men, Crow came in first, Phi
Sigma Kappa finished second, and
Theta Chi finished in third. Alpha
Delta Pie won the women's tour
nament while Chi Omega and
Gamma Phi followed.
In the week's finale, there
was no surprise that Airbands was
as good as all of the hype that sur
rounded it. Some of the acts per
formed by the fraternities included

a remake of Paul Simon's "You
Can Call Me Al," "Thriller," the
Bosstones and a couple of rap
medleys. The women performed
a couple of American acts, Aqua's
"Barbie Girl," The Little
Mermaid's "Under the Sea," the
Brady Bunch theme song, "Men in
Black" and Bon Jovi's "Shot
Through the Heart." To say that
all of the acts were well rehearsed
may not be completely accurate,
but to say that all of the acts were
extremely entertaining would be
very true.

The Bed Races of Greek Week proved to be fun for all, though the bed races showed little for
the engineering skills at Gettysburg College.

Fiji s performance of "You
Can Call Me Al" easily won first
place, while Crow's rap medley of
Wyclef Jean's "Stayin Alive" and
The Notorious B.I.G.'s "Mo
Money, Mo Problems" finished in
second. Right behind them was
Sigma Nu's rendition of the
Mighty Mighty Bosstones' "The
Impression That I Get."
As for the women, we think
that it is safe to say that Alpha
Delta Pi is always the team to beat,
this year proved to be no different.
Their sophomore sisters finished in
first while their senior sisters ended

up in third with two different acts
concerning an American theme.
Finishing in second place were the
Chi Omega seniors with a great
rendition of the Brady Bunch
theme, and other classic tunes from
the seventies.
The final standings were as
follows. For the men, finishing in
third was Fiji, while Sigma Nu fin
ished in second. For the women,
Delta Gamma came in third and
Chi Omega finished in second.
This years Greek Week champions
were... Alpha Chi Rho and Alpha
Delta Pie. Congratulations on a job

well done.
To all sorority women, the
deadline for scholar of the month
has been extended to next Monday.
This means there is still time to
nominate your worthy sisters. The
winner will receive a gift certifi
cate to K&K Records. Send your
nominations to Liz Hickock at Box
1087 or give them to your
Panhellenic delegate before the
Panhel meeting next Monday.

Beyond the Bullets
Making the "Moss" of a second chance

BySteveJenJdns
Sports Editor
Phenom. That was the only
word to describe Randy Moss as
a high school athlete. He lettered
eight times, and in his senior year
was named West Virginia's high
school football player of the year
As a junior and senior, he was
named the states' basketball player
of the year. Randy Moss was be
ing recruited by Notre Dame and
many other colleges until an event
that changed his life occured.
Spurned by racial slurs and
other demeaning conduct, Moss
took part in a brawl that saw many
people injured and cost Moss his
shot to play at the "mother of all
football programs" Notre Dame.
Moss was then recruited by
Bobby Bowden and the Seminoles
of Florida State. "He was the most
amazing football player I have
ever seen," said the Seminoles
Bowden. "I gauge everything off
of Deion [Sanders], and this guy
reminds me so much of him."

In 199S, Moss was a red
shirt freshman at FSU. He was not
playing very often, and more
trouble made its way into Moss'
life. After Moss had been hang
ing out with some friends, they de
cided to try some marijuana.
Moss was already on probation
after charges stemming from the
fight at his high school, and when
he was caught for marijuana use,
he was arrested and a hearing was
scheduled.
Randy Moss pleaded guilty
to the charges involving the mari
juana and received 30 days in jail
and a mandatory probation term.
"He suffered a huge disappoint
ment," his lawyer said, "there is
no one to blame but himself. He
knows it. He knows it better than
anybody."

After being kicked off the
Florida State football team, Randy
Moss returned home to West Vir
ginia. He transfered to in-state
Marshall University, and Moss
and Marshall have been like "peas
and carrots" ever since.
The first time that Moss, a
wide receiver, ever caught a pass
for Marshall, he ran 26 yards for
a touchdown. This was only a in¬

kling of what was to come for the
Marshall Thundering Herd and all
of their fans.
In 1996, Randy Moss
caught more regular season touch
down passes than any other fresh
man in NCAA History with 19.
(This was the same number of
touchdowns that Desmond
Howard of Michigan scored when
he was awarded the Heisman Tro
phy.) Moss scored, at least, one
touchdown in every game and
scored a touchdown in the first
quarter of the first nine games of
1996. Moss twice tied the

Marshall single game touchdown
record with four touchdowns
against The Citadel and Montana.
In the first round of the 1996
NCAA playoffs, Moss caught
eight passes for 288 yards versus
the University of Delaware - set
ting a Marshall university, South
ern Conference, and NCAA 1-AA
playoff records for receiving yard
age in a single game. Also against
Delaware, Moss showed that he
was "faster than the speed of light"
as he scored two touchdowns in
less than 70 seconds. Impressive,
to say the least.

At the end of the 1996 sea
son, Moss was named a first team
All-American by all five award
ing organizations: Walter Camp,
Football Gazette, The Sports Net
work, Associated Press, and
American Football Quarterly.
During the 1996 campaign,
he caught 78 passes for 1,709
yards and 28 touchdowns. Moss'
28 touchdown receptions tied the
record for most touchdowns ever
in a single season of NCAA foot
ball. (Some guy named Jerry Rice
had 28 in 1984. Anybody ever
heard of him?)
Here are a few quotes from
some semi-famous organizations
regarding Randy Moss:
"Moss has sport's trump
card: talent. Better, he has the kind
of breath taking athletic gifts seen
once in a generation." -Sports Il
lustrated

"You may never have heard
of Marshall's Randy Moss, but as
the best player in College football,
he will not be a secret for long." -
Los Angeles Times
"The most gifted wide

reciever college football has seen
since Jerry Rice." - Boston Globe.
This season Marshall Uni
versity has moved up to compete
with the big boys in Division 1
football. As a tremendous athlete,
and Marshall's first ever Heisman
trophy candidate, Moss was also
named to a few preseason All
America teams by: Playboy, The
Sporting News, Street and Smith
Football, and Football News. He
was selected by Street and Smith's
as the number one reason to watch
college football, and was rated the
number one reciever in college

football by The Sporting News.
Through only the first few
weeks of this college football sea
son, Randy Moss has already es
tablished himself as a Division 1
player and has put himself in the
running for the most prized award
in Division 1 football: The
Heisman Trophy.
Moss has compiled some
impressive numbers in his sopho
more season. He currently has 38
receptions for 789 yards and 14
touchdowns. No, that is not a ty
pographical error, he hasl4 touch
downs. He has scored 84 points

and is looking to smash all kinds
of records with his 4.2 speed (40
yard dash) and his awesome ath
letic talent.
Randy Moss is an athlete of
a different breed. He has talent,
size, and ability, but one of the
most important things that he has
is luck. Because of a few incidents
Randy Moss almost amounted to
nothing; all that talent was almost
washed away forever. Randy
Moss is receiving a second chance
at Marshall University, and he is
making the most of it.

Rugby Women make debut

As the sun rose over the
majestic landscape of the Gettys
burg Battlefields, new faces ap
peared, those of the Gettysburg
College Women's Rugby Club.
The newest edition to the athlet
ics at Gettysburg took on
Susquehanna University.
The game was intense. The
Bullets defense was tough with

help from flanker Kelly Graham,
who later suffered her first concus
sion (congrats Kelly welcome to
rugby). The Bullets remained
tough throughout the first half de
spite two quick trys by
Susquehanna.
The second half the Bullets
settled down and with good con
ditioning started to take advantage
of the S.U. backs. Jeannie
Albrecht, now of legendary status,
ran wild through the S.U.
backfield. She was slowed by her

pony tail twice as the S.U.
women's team could not seem to
find anything else to grab.
Sarah Calhoun shout down
pack play with her aggressive play
and fullback Courtney Young was
fierce on the attack (see photo be
low). The team played well over
all. They are young and new to
this foreign sport. They have the
athleticism to go far with help
from their coach. Captain Deb

The Bullets soccer team
continued their rampage this past
week with three more victories,
extending their winning streak to
12 games and their overall record
to 12-1. The Lady Bullets now
have the school record of 14 con
secutive wins in their sights. If
they continue at this pace, there
will be no stopping them.
The Bullets opened up Fam
ily Weekend on the road at Ursinus
in another Centennial Conference
match up. The Bullets buried the
Bears, 5-0, to preserve their un
defeated conference record. A
balanced scoring effort was high
lighted by freshman Jill
Piekarski's first career goal.

Also scoring for the Bullets
were Maureen McBrien, Amy
Brewster, Patsy Cors, and Lyndsay
Murphy. Brewster assisted on
both McBrien's and Cors' goals.
Also, goalkeeper Beth O'Boyle
earned her seventh shutout of the

season. In the second half the Bul
lets extended their lead to 2-0
when Paula Connard notched an
unassisted goal. However, Stock
ton tallied a goal when a free kick
deflected off the crossbar and was
headed in by a Stockton front run
ner. Many inexperienced teams
may have lay down and died.
However these Bullets are tougher
and stronger than the "other guys."
The Bullets surged ahead and
added another goal when Lauren

Scott collected Amy Brewster's
shot off the crossbar and placed it
in the back of the net for her sec
ond goal of the season. Stockton
did rebound however, and almost
immediately they rallied against
Scott's goal and pushed the score
to 3-2.
The Bullets suppressed the
late rally by Stockton and once
again came out on top. The tre
mendous team effort on the part
of the Bullets was the key to their
success in this hard fought battle.
Senior Captain and goalkeeper
Beth O'Boyle once again came up
big in leading the Bullets to vic
tory. Last week's overtime win
against Swarthmore, along with
their double win weekend, was
enough to put the Bullets among
the top ten teams in the nation.
This week the Bullets checked in
at number nine in the NCAA Na
tional Poll. The Bullets remain at

However, in yesterday's

sole possession of the conference
lead with a 3-1 victory over West

Brewster to extend her scoring
streak to 11 consecutive games
with two goals and an assist.
Maureen McBrien assisted
Brewster's second goal while
Patsy Cors assisted the first and
also scored one of her own. This

forth a demanding tone for Gettys
burg amongst the rest of the
region's teams.
In the first half of play, Chris
Pryor scored a goal to jump start
the Getysburg offense. There were
many more shots to come from the
Bullets in the first half, but Pryor's
was the only goal. In the second
half of play, both Jason Vishio and
Jesse Flynn scored a goal.
Now the tempo of the game
was on the Gettysburg side. The
Bullets thwarted all efforts by the
Haverford offense with tough de
fense. Jon Katerba played a great
game at goal as he blocked and
saved every shot by the Haverford
offense. This win by the Gettys
burg men gives them a conference
record of 2-0-1 and an overall
record of 6-3-1.
The next game for the Bul
lets is on October 8 at 4:00 at York
College. Hopefully they will have
the same dominant success they
had at Haverford.

On October 4, at 2:30, the
men's soccer team traveled to
Haverford College to take on the
school. The Gettysburg team
came to the game with a full head
of steam as they swept up the
Haverford squad in an impressive
3-0 bout.
Stars of the game were
Chris Pryor, Jason "Supa' Fly"
Vishio, and Jesse Flynn. The im
pressive play of goal keeper Jon
Katerba led the team to their third
shutout in conference play.
The Gettysburg men dis
played great offensive play as they
outshot their opponents and out
played them. The men's defense
is also credited with a great game
as they shutout their opponents
impressively.
The Haverford squad, at the
time, was ranked fifth in the re
gion while Gettysburg was ranked
fourth in the region. This win set

SPORT SPOTLIGHT
Mr. Gurski's Neighborhood

Kevin Gurski lives life with
a huge smile on his face. The se
nior football player likes to have
fun, and this is evident in all as
pects of his life. All through el
ementary school and the pee-wee
football leagues Kevin begged his
parents to let him play football.
But the answer kept coming back
the same, "No!"
Instead Gurski spent his
younger years playing soccer, a
game which he got pretty good at
and enjoyed playing. In the eighth
grade his parents finally allowed
him to play football and even con
vinced him to go out for the team.
Kevin immediately fell in love
with football.
He played for his junior
high school in Harrisburg during
his eighth and ninth grade years
before graduating onto the high
school. As a sophomore, Kevin
was afraid that he was too small
and too short to play high school
football.

ByCheshaMffler StaffWriter

After much harassing from
the high school coach who had
heard of Gurski's talent, Kevin
made a decision which has af
fected the course of his life since.
Two weeks into the season Gurski
finally hustled out to the football
field for the junior varsity team.
"I was way behind and had
a lot to learn," said Gurski, "but it
was great. I'm really glad that I
did it." Gurski began his career
as a defensive back, and aside
from a brief trial as an offensive
receiver, he has continued to play
in that position.
After being actively re
cruited by Head Coach Barry
Streeter and "falling in love" with
everything about Gettysburg,
Gurski found himself playing
football for the Bullets. "I was
really impressed with Coach
Streeter," explained Kevin, "I have
a lot of respect for the whole
coaching staff. It has been a great
program to be a part of."

As a four year starter at free-safety, Senior Kevin Gurski has been the Bullets main hitman

Gurski has had a very suc
cessful football career at Gettys
burg thus far. Aside from some
time out due to a bout with mono
nucleosis during his freshman
year, Kevin has spent four years
starting for the Bullets. Last year,
as a junior, he was named to the
second team All-Centennial Con
ference, led the team in intercep
tions (five) and had the second
best record for tackles (103).
At the present time Kevin
has made 193 tackles, which he
hopes to improve to 300 tackles
in his career by the end of the sea
son. He is well on his way towards
this, leading the team with 40 tack
les this season.
"I love to compete," said
Kevin, "I get to go one-on-one as
a defensive back and it's great."
Gurski has such a "great time"
playing because he has the right
attitude. It is also really special
for him to be playing with his best
friends.

Since junior high, Kevin
has always found his best friends
to be those that he was playing
football with. "I have the most
respect for the guys I've played
with. It's a lot of fun, especially
with friends," Gurski explained.
"I have really enjoyed playing
with everyone [on the team]," said
Gurski, "I appreciate everyone
playing and having a good time. I
will be really sad to see it all end."
Streeter is very proud of all
that Gurski has accomplished. He
has been a real asset to the Get¬

tysburg football team because of
his leadership qualities, commit
ment, and talent.
"Kevin is a really dedicated
athlete. He's a program kid," said
Streeter, "he does whatever he can
to make it a successful program."
Gurski is really respected by all
of his teammates and coaches for
his dedication and dependability.
"What I like best about Kevin,"
explained Streeter, " is his posi
tive, upbeat attitude. I really en
joy being around him."
Streeter believes that

Off the field Kevin is all smiles, but on the field however, Kevin loves to "bring tf?e lumber"

Gurski's successes have to come
to him because of his work ethic
and positive attitude. "He has the
physical qualities, like good speed
and height, too, but it is his con
stant hard work that makes him the
success that he is," Streeter ex
plains.
Gurski works hard in every
aspect of his life. Kevin spends a
great deal of time, "maybe too
much time," he said, on his school
work. He is always looking to
please himself and his parents.
The management major is
also very involved with his frater¬

nity, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, where
he is the treasurer. Kevin also
works with the Special Olympics
and United Way through SAE. He
hopes to get a job in marketing or
sales after graduation this spring
and would really like to be near a
big city like Washington, DC, Bal
timore, or Philadelphia.
Gurski is a very happy per
son, it is hard to wipe the smile
off of his face, a quality he at
tributes to his mother, Rosemary.
"I really respect both of my par
ents," he said, "My dad taught me
hard work and dedication. My
mom taught me to always turns

bad situations into good. She can
always smile and crack a joke, and
she's a child at heart."
Gurski has gained all of
these excellent qualities from both
of his parents, and he uses them
well. Kevin finds success and hap
piness in his life because he
chooses to look at life in the best
possible light. "I wake up every
morning with a smile on my face,"
he said smiling, of course, "I al
ways try to find the good in any
bad situation-1 just want to have
fun with life!"

Sports Weekly —

Bullets, aimed at Hopkins, miss the mark

ByJoshEyler
Assistant Sports editor
Someone once said that luck
is the meeting of opportunity and
preparation. Well, last Saturday
the Bullets were well prepared to
meet the visiting Blue Jays from
Johns Hopkins, but they seemed to
be missing the opportunities. Per
haps, Lady Luck decided to take a
vacation.
Maybe she just stayed at
home to watch Sports Center. I
don't know. What I do know is that
the Bullets had a very large case
of bad luck. Passes fell short,
passes went long, and, in general,
there were a lot of silly mistakes
that turn the tide on a team that is
playing its heart out.
About luck, guru of football
Chris "Sweet Lou" Lunardi had to
say: "Hey, you win some, you lose
some. I guess somebody didn't
want us to win this one."

The Bullet offense was very
evenly balanced on Saturday, scor
ing six points in the first half and
six in the second. Freshman quar
terback Dennis Flaherty played ex
tremely well in his first collegiate
start. He gained 41 yards on eight
carries and was five for 24 with 50
yards in the passing department.
Sophomore fullback Paul

run. Place kicker Wayne Rumsey
made field goals of 37 and 27
yards, respectively, to keep the
Bullets alive.
Unfortunately, the Blue
Jays' offense was on a roll on Sat
urday. They gained 386 yards on
the ground and scored 17 points
in the first half. However, it is a
tribute to the Bullet defense that
Johns Hopkins only scored a field
goal after halftime. Jason Osborn
was once again named to the Cen
tennial Conference Honor Roll for
a performance in which he made
14 tackles and recovered a fumble.
Behind the mighty Osborn came
the usual tandem of Kevin Gurski,
Chad Mire, and the rest of the Bul
let defense that held tough in the
trenches all day long.

This weekend, the Yellow
Jackets (2-2 in the CC) of
Randolph Macon come to Gettys
burg (1-2 in the CC). About the
upcoming game Derek Reed said,
"They're a good team and we will
have to play up to our capabilities
to beat them." It is only the third
time that the two teams have met
with each team winning on its
home field.
You know what that means.
They're on our turf. Barring a sud
den absence from Lady Luck, Get
tysburg should show Randolph
Macon exactly what a Bullet can
do to a Yellow Jacket.

Smith had another chew 'em up
and spit 'em out performance with
235 all-purpose yards of which

114 were gained in rushing. Smith
also scored the Bullets' only
touchdown on a monster 36 yard
