Alpha Xi Delta withdraws from Formal Rush

Right Now

Chapter seeks more effective way to recruit new members

By Laura Root
Staff Reporter The Beta Chi chapter of Alpha Xi
Delta has withdrawn from Formal
Panhellenic Rush this year. Instead, the
chapter will conduct its own informal
rush in February.
The withdrawal was originally
proposed by Alpha Xi Delta National
Headquarters in November.
In past years, Formal Rush has not
been as sucessful as the chapter would
have liked. After the death of Casey
Dunn last semester, the organization
has 18 members.
The Chapter president, Marcie
DePalma stated that "In the past few
years, the numbers have gone down for
every sorority. By doing something dif
ferent, we're trying to rebuild the chap
rer." DePalma also added: "we are not

looking just to increase our numbers;
the quality of women we want to re
cruit is very important."
By withdrawing from rush, Alpha
Xi Delta is infact helping the other four
sororities by allowing them take larger
pledge classes, since they can only draw
from the women registered for rush.
Currently, 117 women are going
through rush. "Panhel and the other
sororities have been very supportive,"
said DePalma.
The chapter participated in last
weekend's first round of Formal Rush,
but will not participate in this
weekend's festivities. Instead, it will
offer informal events, including a Pub
lic Relations Week during the first week
of February, a Mocktail Party before the
February 6 Snow Ball, a visit to the Al
pha Xi Delta philanthropy of the
Children's Hospital on February 7, and
a Coffee House on February 8. An in-

rnoio oy _tmiiy tiianeiier
Alpha Xi DeltaSisters chat with Rushees _durinq the first round of parties last Friday.

formation session will be held on Feb
ruary 13. These events are open to all
non-greek females on campus.
"The entire chapter is working
tirelessly to make this work for every
one," said DePalma. "We are incred
ibly excited and very enthusiastic about
rush this year.
Alpha Xi Delta will deliver bids
on Sunday, February 15. The strategy
that Alpha Xi Delta is planning to fol
low is not new. It has been tried in sev
eral sororities at many different colleges
and has been very successful. Next year,
Alpha Xi Delta plans to return to the
formal rush practice after using this new
opportunity to increase its numbers.
"Doing normal rush hasn't been
helping us," DePalma said. She called
the new process "a more relaxed and
informal way to meet rushees. We want
a chance to really get to know these
women in a way that formal rush

doesn't allow."
"In the past, we've brought in
more new members during informal
rush," she said.
Most members of Alpha Xi Delta
feel that the change in rushing policies
is for the better. Tamara King, an Edu
cational Leadership Consultant for Al
pha Xi Delta National Headquarters,
observed that, "A lot of the women rush
ing sororities today are not interested
in the frills and pressures of Formal
Rush."
DePalma commented that "We
have a lot of support from National
Headquarters," and said that Alpha Xi's
alumni "support any effort to help
strengthen the chapter."
The informal festivities will be a
less stressful method to join the sister
hood of Alpha Xi Delta than the more
structured rushes of past years.

The $50,000 Question
Student Life Committee will allocate money for social activities

by Keith Davis
Staff Reporter
Across most of the cam
pus, arguments about the lack
of social activity available have
left fault with the administra
tion. Now, a new opportunity
aimed at strengthening student
activities lies solely in the hands
of the students.
The Student Life Com
mittee will be responsible for
allocating $50,000 in an at
tempt to strengthen and im
prove the current social situa
tion. The committee will have
its first official meeting today
to establish its operating meth
ods and determine how it will
function in the lives of students.
According to Dean
Ramsey, the SLC is intended to
be an experiment that places
more responsibility on students
so they can make the necessary
initiatives to improve social
activities.

"It is clear that because of
BYOB the social life is chang
ing," Ramsey said.
Ramsey further com
mented that the college could
do a better job in providing
more social outlets, especially
to first year students and
sophomores. But the adminis
tration decided that students
needed to be taking the initia
tives and risks involved also.

Consequently, President
Haaland decided to offer
$50,000 to the now forming
SLC. "The idea of this commit
tee is to put this money directly
in the hands of the students,"
Ramsey said. "I want to leave
maximum flexibility to the
[committee]."

money. -Jen Gillette 1 w °
Accord- groups

ing to Ramsey, the money is not
the most important issue.
Ramsey wants people to get out
of the complaining mode.
"This is the time for the
creativity to come forward,"
she said. "If you don't like the
way it is, here is a chance to
change it."
Although SLC is an ex
periment, the outcome is not
considered as important as the
opportunity.
"The real emphasis is on
trying new things and improv
ing social lives, not whether or
not the project fails," Ramsey
said. Dean Ramsey also said
the committee was designed in
order to be independent of

other organizations to avoid
becoming part of the bureau
cratic system. The committee
will be structured but not
enough to hamper the oppor
tunity. The money was not
given to SAC, the current or
ganization offering alternative
activities to the Greek system,
because their schedule and bud-

will compliment each other. We
will have to becareful not to
step on SAC's shoulders,"
Ramsey said. "SAC is and will
continue to be the main pro
grammer of campus activities."
Ramsey expects that the
experiment will end in one of
two ways. The first is if the
committee is unable to estab
lish itself as a popular resource,
SAC could apply for greater
funds. The second option
would be that if the committee
did establish itself as a popular
resource then the administra
tion would examine the possi
bility of continuing the SLC
program. Ramsey encourages
caution however, because she
says the nature of social activ¬

ity needs to be subject to
change. This change would
need to come from constant

innovation.
The SLC is an experiment
currently contained only to the
spring semester. "[President
Haaland] has made no prom
ise that it would be an ongoing
basis," Ramsey said. In regards
to this opportunity, she said, "I
am pretty optimistic."
The six SLC members
were chosen by the administra
tion to discuss problems of so
cial life with the college's trust
ees. The committee formed
from the discussion. The mem
bers represent a wide range of
social organizations on campus.
Member Jen Gillette is
part of the Greek system and is
an RA in a freshman dorm. She
believes the current social at
mosphere is unfair.

"We want to help plan
something fantastic," she said.
Member Rodwin Lowe, a
representative of Christian Fel
lowship and the Black Student
Union, said the SLC exists to
represent the student body.
"It is not our commit
tee, he said. Lowe is not intimi
dated by the amount of money
he and his colleagues will be
allocating.
"Personally for me it is
not a problem."

First African American professor
completes tenure track

College to hold lecture
on ecofeminism

by Daniel Larkin
News Editor
In December of 1997,
Gettysburg College for the first
time, awarded to tenure to an
African American professor.
Dr. Deborah Barnes of the En
glish department is not only the

first African
American pro
fessor to be
granted tenure,
but the first to be
placed in the
tenure track.

ing this mile

honored, but at the same time,
I am shocked that no one has
ever been on the tenure track."
Barnes noted that this
event is one among several
"firsts" in her lifetime. In the
first grade, she was the first to
integrate the school she at
tended. She was the first to re
ceive a doctorate in English in
only three years from Howard

the first in several things in
life," she said, "but not neces
sarily integration in 1998."
Barnes was one of seven
professors who were up for
tenure last semester. All were
granted tenure. This was mark
edly different from the fall of
1996, where only one of the

three candidates was awarded
tenure.
When tenure track pro
fessors are reviewed, they are
evaluated based upon three cri
teria: teaching, research, and
governance. Professors in last
year's group of candidates were
denied tenure due to what the
College deemed inad
equate research.
When asked if this sent a
message to this year's group of

research. It really is about the
research."
Barnes stated that she
feels that professors should be
rewarded for innovation and
excellence in classroom teach
ing. Barnes said that she is
grateful that Gettysburg's lack
of a summer session provides
professors with opportunity to
do research. "I can't teach the
way I want to teach and do re
search at the same time," she
said.

Feat u res
hole" lot of individuality

A"
by Cara Masucci and Rebecca
Babbitt
Staff Reporters
At first glance,
Gettysburg College can some
times seem to be a campus of
students who are carbon cop
ies of each other. The J. Crew
look can interfere with a
student's individualism, so
many times students look for
other ways to display their in
dividuality. One way students
express themselves is through
body art. As a somewhat new
trend, body art allows people
to be as discrete or as distinct
as they would like.
When first year student
Eileen Fortune decided to get
tattooed a few months ago, she
and her friends went to Eric
Von Don's Elite Tattooing.
Because of a special affection
for all things Irish and her love
of Celtic art, Fortune decided
to get a Celtic cross on her
ankle. While at the tattoo par
lor, she saw another design that
was of special interest to her: a
water and fire ying-yang, which
she is thinking about getting
tattooed on her shoulder blade.

Fortune said it was a neat
experience because the owner

of the parlor painted the out
side of the building in an intri
cate design himself. She also
said that she was not worried
about infection because every
thing was safe and clean. "You
could actually see them take the
needles out of the package."

For first year student
Mandi Kalbach, the experi
ence was much the same.
Known as an elephant fanatic,
Kalbach decided to have her
passion tattooed "on her leg.
Unlike Fortune, Mandi has had

hers f o r
several
years.
She likes

cause it

crete,
but she

is still able to express her indi
viduality nicely.
Many students have
body art done in the beginning
of their first year. Students test
the limits of their indepen
dence from their parents by
getting something pierced or
tattooed.
It is also an interesting
way for the younger first year
students to celebrate their

eighteenth birthdays.
Reactions to piercings
and tattoos vary from parent
to parent. Many students also
use these activities as a form
of rebellion.
The piercing of various
body parts is also quite com¬

mon among college students.
Ear and tongue piercings are the
most popular.
Susannah Kopcho has a
total of 22 piercings, including
a tongue ring. "I knew I wanted
to have one ear covered," said

the first
year stu
dent, a
feat she
achieved by having
17 holes
put in her
right ear.
Kopcho
estimates she has
spent over
$400 on
piercings.

sive piercing does

stand out, "It's not for other
people, [it's] more for myself,"
she said. "Some people think it's
stupid or pointless, but some
people like it," she said.
As for her future plans,
Kopcho said she would "like to
have my lip pierced."
Unlike Kopcho, first year
student Casey Martin didn't
plan his tongue piercing. "It
was spur of the moment," he
said. "Ear piercing is too com
mon, nipple piercing is too
painful. Tongue piercing
sounded interesting," he said.
Martin, who had his
tongue pierced last Saturday, is
still suffering from a swollen
tongue. "The actual piercing
didn't hurt, but afterward there
was a sharp pain," he said.

Martin s tongue piercing
is slightly off-center because of
his webbing-the piece of skin
under the tongue that connects
it to the floor of the mouth.
This was done in order to pierce
the tongue far enough back

Last year, a study was

in decline. Many park facili

to close, parks have had to
shorten their seasons, and
maintenance of historic build

have been caused by lack of
protection from the prevent
able threats that plague the na
tional parks.
For example, there are
clearcuts right up to the edge
of Yellowstone and Olympia
National Parks, and the bison
population at Yellowstone has
been drastically reduced by
capture and slaughter along the
park border. Real estate devel
opment on the boundaries of
Saguaro National Park puts
human activities right at the
park's edge.
The list goes on and on,
including such problems as traf
fic, mining, hazardous materi
als, and grazing. Whether they
originate inside or outside of a
park, the threats are diverse
and complex, and due to these
threats, natural resources in the
national park system are dete
riorating.

Despite the problems
many parks have been having,
they have been attracting more
visitors each year. Our national

parks receive 40 million more
visitors each year than they did
20 years ago, with numbers
expected to increase to over
300 million visitors per year by
1999. Ironically, some parks

ing to get away from.
Unfortunately, the parks'
budgets have not kept pace
with their visitations. Funding
for the national parks between
1978 and 1996 has actually
decreased, by over $600 mil
lion, making the total budget
$1.4 billion. This may sound
like a large amount of money
but it has not been enough to
keep many of the parks in good
condition.
Hopefully in the near fu
ture, government officials will
realize that our national parks
deserve more attention than

they are presently receiving.
These parks are part of our
heritage, and if we may lose an
important part of our history.

In Case You Missed It
It's still a Scream, baby

by Eileen O'Donnell
Movie Columnist
Writer/director Wes Cra
ven has rekindled interest in the
classic slasher movie with his
1996 film Scream. If you
haven't seen it by now, better
hurry up, because the nineties
are about to leave without you.
The cast of Scream is
filled with today's rising stars,
led by Party of Five star Neve
Campbell. You'll also find fa
miliar faces like Friends star
Courtney Cox, Parenthood's
David Arquette, and even
Henry Winkler (a.k.a. The
Fonz), who has a cameo as the
principal of Woodsboro High.
Sadly, after more than a
decade of gory slasher flicks
like Halloween, A Nightmare
on Elm Street, and Friday the
13th, the genre faded from the
theaters.
Lately, however, it has

been making a comeback be
cause of this revolutionary
motion picture. Scream was a
surprise hit that took both crit
ics and the advertising market
by storm. After its initial run
in late 1996, it was re-released
in the spring of 1997 for a sec
ond run. _^^^^M
Scream relies _^^^^H
heavily on the "for- _^^^^H
mula" of slasher _^^^^H
movies like Hal- _^^_BHI
loween. While _^^m
watching this _^H i
movie, you can _^H I
pick out many _^H '
similarities be- _^^_L
tween it and your _^^_HH
favorite old-school _^^^^H
scary movies. The
film has the unique ability to
bring the audience to the brink
of terror, and then have them
falling out of their seats laugh
ing. It's quite an experience.
The movie opens in typi¬

cal horror movie fashion.
Casey (Drew Barrymore) is
home alone waiting for her
boyfriend when she gets a dis
turbing phone call. This phone
call leads to a bad end for Casey
and her boyfriend, Steve.
_Saetn

is not a movie for the faint of
heart: it opens with gore, and
it doesn't let up until its un
usual ending.
Campbell gives a stun
ning performance as Sydney, a

high school student who finds
that she is the next target of the
serial killer who is terrorizing
Woodsboro, the fictional set
ting of the movie. Sydney also
squares off against tabloid re
porter Gail Weathers (Cox),
author of a tell-all
^^^^_ book about the high
^^^^| profile murder of
_^^^^_h Sydney's mother.
_^^^^_B Like every hor
R ^^^_H ror movie heroine,
_^^M Sydney fends off the
_^H killer with the help
_^H of her best friend,
_^H Tatu m. Rose
_^^H McGowan (of the
¦^^^_J newly-released Phan
^^^^_H toms) plays this part
brilliantly, shining as

the fun-loving friend.
SkeetUlrich (As Good As
It Gets ), who was probably
cloned from a strand of Johnny
Depp's DNA, plays Billy,
Sydney's brooding boyfriend.

His innocence and intentions
are called into question on
more than one occasion.
Sydney's and Billy's char
acters contribute to the dark
ness of the film, while Tatum,
her boyfriend, Stu, and their
friend Randy all add to the
lighter side of the movie.
Scream is truly a fun
movie to watch. The screen
play is hip and original, and it
pokes fun at the whole slasher
genre. The subtle tensions and
ambiguities of the plot will
keep you on the edge of your
seat every time you watch it.
This is perhaps one of the most
definitive movies of our gen
eration.
The popularity of the
movie has already led to one
sequel, with a third movie cur
rently in the works. And to
understand these films, a
knowledge of the original is a
must!

A wannabe good movie

and Mike "Opinionated Spice"

movie also with extremely low
expectations. In fact, I even
tried to avoid writing a review
for this "film" until a certain
fellow reviewer threatened me
bodily harm if I did not endure
it. In spite of myself, I was
rather amused at parts of Spice
World. The self effacing humor
of the band, at times mocking
their own success and absur
dity of it all, was refreshing to
see. Too many musicians take
themselves way too seriously
(Pearl Jam or Oasis anyone?)
and it was fresh to see a group
that knows their star will fall
faster than it rose. Yet, I must
admit, most of the movie was
a cheesy and contrite concoc
tion of music videos and pre
dictable melodrama.

Dan: Spice World presents
the zany misadventures of a Brit
ish pop group with distinctive
personalities who have taken the
world by storm. Sound famil
iar? Well, if you're looking for a
nineties version of A Hard Day's
Night, I'm sorry to disappoint
you. Spice World stars the ever
popular and always frightening
Spice Girls (Mel C. "Scary Spice"
, Mel B. "Sporty Spice", Victoria
"Posh Spice", Emma "Baby
Spice", and Geri "Ginger Spice")
in their first full-length motion
picture.
The "plot" of this gem in
volves the girls' attempts to have
fun while avoiding an evil tab
loid photographer on the week
leading up to their first live con
cert and the wacky fun they have
along the way.

I went into to see Spice
World with very low expecta
tions. Leave it to the Spice Girls
to surpass them. The movie is
basically a bunch of Spice Girls
music videos strung together by
a really weak story.
Mike: I never had the op
portunity to see A Hard Day's
Night, and I guess that I have a
general disdain for movies about
bands. As a result, I went to this

Spice World's lame at
tempts at self-parody serve to
highlight what might have been
a clever and amusing look at a
bizarre cultural phenomenon.
But the movie instead is much
more interested in serving as a
marketing machine for the
quintet and their music.
Yet, I must also add, even
though this movie is blatant
marketing, it does a slick job
in doing so. Cameo appear
ances and bit parts by the likes
of George Wendt (Norm!),
Elton John, Meatloaf, Elvis
Costello, and Roger Moore all

provide a healthy dose of
chuckles.
/ think my favorite part
of Spice World was the eleven
year old girl sitting behind me
who new every line of the
movie and sang all the songs.
I also wonder who the
film's target audience is sup
posed to be. The show I went
to was packed with preteens,
but some of the film's content
is a bit racy. I also wonder at
the value of a group of women
who preach "girl power" while
prominently displaying their

T&A. Plan 9 From Outer Space
has nothing on Spice World.
This is one of the worst movies
I've seen in my entire life. I
honestly think that everyone
who was in the theater with me
is stupider for having seen it.
No stars (out of five).
This movie is pretty bad.
It left me missing the Monkee's
television show. I'll tell you
what I want, what I really re
ally want: I want this whole
Spice Girls phenomenon to
fade faster than Vanilla Ice's
career. However, for effort and
some original laughs, I give this
a one out of five stars. How
ever, I sincerely hope the man
agement of the Majestic will
have the decency to replace this
film with something more
watchable.

Curtain Call
A month of theater

by Glen Beck
Theater Columnist
Here on the Gettysburg
College campus the month of
February will most certainly
lend itself to the theater. Mark
your calendars for three major
events heading your way.
Next Tuesday, February
3, performance artist Paule
Turner will present two short
pieces in Stevens Lab Theater
at 12 p.m. Don't worry, the
show will be short enough so
that students will not miss their
1:10 classes.
The performance consists
of a twenty minute piece called
Porch Monkey, followed by a
ten minute excerpt from a
longer work entitled She's Out
of Her Time." Discussion may
follow.

On Tuesday, February 10,
the National Theatre of the
Deaf (NTD) will present
Henrik Ibsen's play Peer Gynt.
The play is directed by Will
Rhys, and features dances by
Pilobolus Dance Company, one
of the top dance companies in
the country. The performance
will be at 8 p.m. in the College
Union Building Ballroom.
Tickets are free.
The performance will
feature both American Sign
Language and spoken words.
The company is a professional

acting company made up of
deaf and hearing actors.
The NTD has received
critical acclaim throughout its
30-year history for its adapta
tions of classic literature. The
company has adapted works
by such authors as Chekhov,
Voltaire, Homer, Moliere,
Ibsen, and Puccini. The NTD
also performs original works.
The NTD has collabo
rated with such artists as Chita
Rivera, Jason Robards, Arvin
Brown, Bill Irwin and Peter
Sellars. In 1977, the NTD won
a Tony Award for theatrical
excellence.
Then, on Saturday, Feb
ruary 14, don't forget about
the Pow-Wow. It will start at
11 a.m. And run throughout
the day. Check the publica
tions circulating around cam
pus for further information.

Keep looking out for the
O8cN winter production of
Cotton Patch Gospel, set to
open on Thursday, February
26. Rehearsals are currently
underway. This toe-tapping
version of the Gospel accord
ing to Matthew guarantees a
crowd-pleasing evening.
Come watch your fellow stu
dents act, dance, and sing their
way through a musical you'll
be sure not to forget. More in
formation will follow in the
upcoming weeks.

Cafeteria connoisseur complains of crowds

by LA. Isherwood
Staff Writer As a social critic, my
role on this staff is to provide
a different opinion and new
insight on issues pertaining to
the campus community. That
means, for lack of more elo
quent terms, I bitch about
events or institutions on this
campus which tend to aggra
vate me and others with
whom I have had immediate
contact.
As I walked into our
school cafeteria on Monday
afternoon, I was irked and
annoyed at many of the events
that are all too common in our
beloved Servo. I felt as
though I was going to have
some sort of a nervous break
down. I confided in a group
of friends, and they instructed
me not to vent my frustrations

Disgruntled postal workers

The Post Office Staff is obligated, by
the college, to place all mail that we
receive into your boxes. We do not
appreciate mail being pushed back
through the boxes, onto the floor,
where we then have to pick up the
mess.
Have a little respect, you are adults!
The Post Office Staff

on them, but rather to write
them down for my next column.
So here is a short narrative about
my usual post-weekend experi
ence at Servo.
I walked into Servo and
proceeded to push my way
through the crowded corridor of
indecisiveness and socialization
to "Checkpoint Esther" where I
was greeted by some of the hap
piest faces in the world, the caf
eteria employees who swipe my
card almost daily.
They are always very good
to the students and seem to
know almost everyone by name,
something which, in itself, is
comforting. I was then con
fronted by a large crowd of stu
dents, all pushing for glasses and
trays. I am always amazed at hoe
hard it seems to be for people to
take their glasses with two
hands, place them on a tray, grab
the necessary silverware, and

then depart for the getting of
good eats. For some reason,
this simple procedure is beyond
the dexterity of some people,
leading to dropped glasses and
a floor strewn with silverware.
It is really not that difficult to
get your utensils neatly, but I
understand that some are inca
pable. Next came the great task
of retrieving food. The food
area is always packed with
people who are often way too
aggressive. It is almost like run
ning a gauntlet to be fed in the
corridor of death as a pack of
hungry wolves seeks its chicken
nuggets and curly fries. Daily
I am almost run over by some
one who is not watching where
he (or she) is going, but talk
ing to a buddy who is also
clumsily running into people.
Then, as I tried to get a ham
burger, I saw a flock of four

_ITs

women talking about the week
end and hookups and the like
and preventing people like me
and the others behind me en
trance to the soup and salad
bar. Honestly, I didn't really
care about anyone's social life,
and all I wanted was a cup of
soup to nurse my sore throat.
Then, I had to once again cross
the gauntlet to the drink area
where there was a huge line
that for some reason didn't
move at all. I went back to my
table really annoyed and tried
to confide this in my friends all
of whom had the same exasper
ating experience. All of us were
too tired, from fighting and
starvation, to attempt to go
through the same ordeal again
just for some more food.

The moral of the story
comes in three helpful hints to
you, the campus community
First, please try to be a little

more tidy inside of Servo. We
all have to eat there and silver
ware strewn about, broken
glasses, and colliding people
don't speak well for an institu
tion of higher learning. Sec
ond, the middle of the food
court is no place for extended
conversations. In fact, it is a
really annoying practice to
those of us who go to Servo to
eat. Please, try to save the con
versations for you tables. And
finally, the drink lines need to
be more efficient, and they can
be if people would decide what
they wanted ahead of time and
possibly learn to fill two glasses
at a time. With people waiting
behind you, it is a little rude to
stand in front of the drink ma
chines for several minutes.

Anyway, those are just my
little complaints and sugges
tions for a better, brighter Get
tysburg College.

The Pachyderm's Pulpit

Al Gore, President sooner than we think?

by John Dunlap
Staff Writer When President Bill
Clinton gave his State of the
Union Address, he spoke as
though no scandal had hit his
administration. The atmo
sphere of the Chief Executive's
speech to Congress, was how
ever, much different. Ameri
cans tuned in not to hear what
his plans for the economy or
education are, but to see the
President in crisis, in the middle
of a media feeding frenzy.
A little over a week ago,
the President expected his State
of the Union Address to be a
triumphant moment. He was
going to be the first President
in 29 years to be able to an
nounce that the budget is bal
anced. With, the new budget
surplus, Bill Clinton had hoped
to make saving Social Security

the big issue of the day. Now
the issue of the day remains
whether or not he took advan
tage of Presidential aides, in a
sexual nature, committed per
jury and/or suborned perjury,
and to what extent has he lied
to the American people. We
now know that he lied in 1992
when he was campaigning for
the New Hampshire Primary
about his affair with Gennifer
Flowers. The President not
only owes the American people
an apology, he owes Miss Flow
ers an apology.
There seems to be no
doubt now that the President
is dragging the honor of the
office of the President of the
United States down. He is the
President of the United States
and he has a responsibility to
uphold the honor and integrity
of the White House. He is fail
ing in that duty. Bill Clinton

could survive this scandal like
he has numerous others:
Whitewater, Troopergate,
Travelgate, Filegate, and the
campaign fundraising scandal,
but now he is left with the Paula
Jones sexual harassment law
suit and allegations of sex in the
White House, and perjury. This
scandal has breached the inner
circle and the President's moral
authority is under attack.
Even if the most severe
allegations are true, impeach
ment seems unlikely. However,
if Paula Jones's lawsuit contin
ues than 1998 could turn into
another 1974 where the presi
dent lost control of the coun
try. President Richard Nixon
lost the moral authority to lead
and his domestic agenda died,
and his foreign policy was
slowed. Watergate consumed
his time and even after he re
signed the new President,
Gerald Ford, took command of

a much weaker presidency.
Congress was empowered and
the Democrats were able to
make huge gains in the Con
gressional midterm elections.
This is what Bill Clinton must
avoid. Open talk about resigna
tion is dangerous and it is a sign
that the President is in crisis.
If Bill Clinton has lost the
moral authority to be Presi
dent, and if he suborned and
committed perjury, obstructing
justice then he should go. This
country deserves better. "Slick
Willy" may not be slick enough.
First lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton wants us to
believe there is some type of
"right-wing" conspiracy against
the President. What world is
she living in? Give us a break,
Mrs. Clinton. People may hate
Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr, but Attorney General
Janet Reno, along with the

Third Judicial Circuit of Wash
ington, D.C. agree. This groups
includes a Judge appointed by
President Lyndon Johnson.
Judge Starr has hit a serious is
sue and lets remember his in
vestigation has not gone nearly
as long as Lawrence Walsh's
Iran-Contra investigation
which lasted seven years, five
of them being after Ronald
Reagan was retired from the
Presidency. He hounded Presi
dent George Bush all through
out his 1992 reelection cam
paign but found nothing. Let
Judge Starr complete his inves
tigation and uncover the truth.
No matter what the far-left says
about Judge Starr, it does not
take away from the charges
against the President. These
charges are so serious that they
could very well determine
whether it will be Al Gore or
Bill Clinton giving next year's
State of the Union Address.

High standards for high officials

by Cammie Grant
Contributing Writer
This past week, the
American public has been bom
barded with rumors about
President Clinton and his al
leged affair with Monica
Lewinsky. Lewinsky, a former
White House intern, claimed
that she and the president had
a sexual affair and he encour
aged her to cover it up. Clinton
responded, "I did not have
sexual relations with that
woman, Miss Lewinsky."
Lewinsky started work
in the White House, as an in
tern in the summer of 1995.

White House officials criticized
Lewinsky's work. She was
sloppy and perhaps a bit loud
and giggly. Hillary Rodham
Clinton has accused the "right
wing" of orchestrating this con
spiracy. The first lady is stand
ing by her man, even after her
husband has admitted to hav
ing an affair with Gennifer
Flowers, and now is denying an
affair with a woman half his
age. Commendably, Newt
Gingrich has decided not to
comment on the accusations
and let the White House handle
the situation. If the Republi
can Party is being accused by

Mrs. Clinton of creating a con
spiracy against her husband and
herself, the best thing for the
right wingers to do is stay out
of it. Obviously, the Republi
cans could not "dig up" or con
spire such information, as
many women have come for
ward. Hillary, open your eyes.
Other high-ranking people
have been punished for their
affairs, and Bill Clinton should
be as well. Kelly Flynn was
discharged from the Air Force
recently after having an affair.
Why should we lower our stan
dards for the Commander in
Chief of our country? After all,
The United States is a brilliant,

vivacious nation and the stan
dards we set should be high and
abided by our leaders. It is our
leader's duty to provide the
United States with the best
reputation.
The President of the
United States should make the
best moral and ethical deci
sions. Although it is not in the
Constitution, it is an obligation
of the president to set a good
standard for the public. Im
peachment is not facing the
president at this time, though,
he could be forced to resign
from office if any more hazard
ous information is presented.
Should the American public

trust a man who has been ac
cused more than once of hav
ing affairs? Should we trust a
man who claims that he "didn't
inhale" or break any laws of the
American government? How
much more lenient should the
public be with our president
and his moral and ethical deci
sions? I hope that in the next
presidential election, the
people will opt to vote for the
most _^qualified, morally
equipped, and honest indi
vidual. Voters should not be
worrying about what is going
on in the West Wing of the
White House and in the Oval,
or should I say "oral" office?

Consider this

At the end of this past se
mester, seven out of seven pro
fessors were granted the brass
ring of teaching, tenure. Given
the abysmal one out of three last
year, this was a significant im
provement.
Based on the fervor that
surrounded last year's much
publicized tenure denials, and
the recent court case, the ma
jority of the campus is aware
that tenure is based upon an
evaluation of the candidate's
research, teaching, and gover
nance.
According to procedure,
the most important quality is
teaching, with research and gov
ernance following respectively
Yet, is this really so?
Based on what this year's group
is saying, research may have
moved to the head of the line
in terms of importance.

Beyond this, does the col
lege even uphold any ranking of
these? How does the FPC mea
sure governance? And what
exactly is considered an ad
equate amount of research?
What has become increas
ingly obvious with the past two
years tenure groups is this: the
majority of the campus has no
idea how the tenure progress
works.
This isn't for lack of try
ing either. Last year, a group of
over one hundred students tried
to find out more and only ran

into a repetition or standard
protocol.
Further, based on a belief
that research is now more im
portant than teaching, it seems
that even the candidates them
selves are confused about what
they need to do to become a
permanent member of this col
lege community.
What can be done about
this issue?
It would be nice to see the
college, in its thrust to move
towards the future, take a long
and hard look at its tenure pro
cess. What do we value in our
staff? Are we a research or a
teaching institution? How do
we go about attracting the best
teachers we possibly can while
still generating academic pres
tige through research?

Let's be honest, everyone
on this campus knows of ten
ured professors who are excep
tional researchers but poor
teachers, exceptional teachers
but poor researchers, and those
who are exceptional in all ar¬

eas. This alone shows that
there are some obvious flaws
with our tenure system here at
Gettysburg College; to deny
this is to bury our collective
heads in the sand.
As a whole, the campus
should throw down the gaunt
let to the administration and
demand a tenure process re
view.

Conflict and Consensus -

"What planet was he on
when Regan was president_?

This is in response to
the exceedingly well-in
formed but far more naive
comments consistantly
written by John Dunlap in
the Pachyderm's Pulpit.
Here is my big news-flash:
BOTH . DEMOCRATS
AND REPUBLICANS LIE!
Conservativesare constantly
banging their fists at the
strings of lies told by Demo
crats. Mr. Dunlap discusses

the dignity brought into the
White House by former Presi
dent Reagan. What planet was
he on when Reagan was presi
dent? What concerns me is the
climate being created in Wash
ington, where no future presi
dent, from any political party,
will be able to run the country
without a special prosecuter
hiding in the shadows, scoop
ing up dirt, and believe me, all

politicians have plenty of it. To
be sure, Mr. Clinton has more
to hide than others but I would
rather have a leader with some
skeletons in his closet than one
who would put women back in
the kitchen, more pollution
into the environment, and a
gun in the hand and a cigarette
in the mouth of every teenager.

To the Editor:

This is a response to
Jay Spiese's article 'True Di
versity' (January 22). The
purpose of raising the issue
of diversity is unquestion
able. I agree that it is 'not a
matter of how we look 1 and
'True diversity comes from
the mind.' However, it is un
deniable that if not for all
but for most individuals
their 'minds' are influenced
by their backgrounds, expe
riences and the cultures they
were raised in.
Our thoughts are not
devoid of the various expe
riences we and/or our ances¬

tors have had. It does not mat
ter how we look but in many
instances our physical features
are an indication of where we
come from and how that has
shaped our minds (our intellect
and thinking). Jay raised many
issues all of which have
stemmed from his observation
that we can be diverse when we
show the diversity in our ideas
and actions. These ideas and
actions I feel cannot be taken
in a vacuum and those who ask
for diversity (such as more
people other than Caucasian)
are saying just that. Our ideas
and actions are influenced by

our cultural identities. A differ
ence of appearances in these
matters is unavoidable. Sec
ondly, it would be, if not any
thing, simply a matter of rec
ognition if the word 'Blacks' is
capitalized since we are not
talking about a color. If we
were to use Hispanics, Jews,
Asians it would make sense to
also use Africans or African
Americans.
Thank You,
Kabir Kumar

John Elway: Hall of Fame resume complete

by Steve Jenkins
Sports Editor
Who says you can't teach
an old dog new tricks? Thirty
seven year old, fifteen year
NFL veteran John Elway, fi
nally reached the pinnacle of a
legendary career with a Super
Bowl victory.
In a courageous effort
Elway passed, handed off,
fought, grabbed, fell, dove and
sprinted his way to a title which
eluded him in his previous
three Super Bowl appearances.
Before Super Bowl
XXXII, John Elway was a good
quaterback, probably the best
to never win the big game.
However, after a tremendous
display of heart and valor, John
Elway will be known as one of
the best.

"It was really incredible,"
said Bronco center Tom Nalen,
"You see your leader, your
franchise guy, giving his all. It
was real motivational for us to
see." Although his stats were
pretty average (12-23, 123

yards, 1 int, 1 rushing TD)
Elway was at the helm for one
of the more exciting Super
Bowls in recent history.
Another amazing thing
about the victory of the Bron
cos was that finally, after what
seemed like hundreds of years
watching the AFC get pum
meled in a weak attempts to
bring home the Super Bowl, the
Broncos finally did it.
Yes, it had been 13 years
since the Al Davis and the Oak
land Raiders last brought home
the Vince Lombardi Trophy.
That means the last time
the AFC won the Super Bowl
JAMS were in style, and The
Bangles rocked the house with
"Walk like an Egyptian."
With the score tied at 17-

facing a third-and-six on the
Packers 12 yard line. A fourth
down would mean a field goal
attempt and most likely a
three point lead, but the
touchdown was the priority.
In a play that typified the
Broncos' win, John Elway
evaded the rush of all-pro
Reggie White, and dove
bravely into the air. After be
ing smashed by Packers safety
Leroy Butler, Elway de
scended towards the early im
planting his fossil-like body to
the ground. One important
fact: he got the first down.
So, as the game ended
the crowd roared for the aged
veteran, and saw that he had
accomplished all he ever
needed.

17, in the fourth quarter the
Broncos were in the midst of a
long drive that started at their
eight yard line. It was the kind
of drive that eats the clock —
something Denver knew it had
to win.
Ten plays into the drive,
Elway had the Denver offense

No matter how many
years he continues to play, no
matter how many touchdowns
he has the rest of his career,
for now John Elway is the best
quaterback in football. And
watch out... he could be the
best ever.

Gettysburg gridiron to see major changes

by Ronnie Beeman
Contributing Writer
The Gettysburg football
team has wasted little time in
making changes for the 1998
football season. The Bullets are
altering the duties of some of
their coaches to dethrone West
ern Maryland as top dog in the
Centennial Conference.
The major move will see
the movement of head coach
Barry Streeter from offensive
coordinator to defensive coor
dinator. This allows for head
baseball coach and the new spe
cial teams/backfields coach
John Campo to devote his full
attention on his baseball duties,
instead of trying to prepare for
the upcoming football season.
Streeter is taking over a
defense that has lost four
starters. These include captains
Joe Hodakowski and Rob Sena,
Kevin Gurski, and Tom
Olchon.

Seniors Chris Felton, Jus
tin Domingos, Chad Mire,
Brain Murphy, Ryan
MacNamee and Jason Osborn
will be looked to for leadership.
Chris Lunardi is the heir appar-

Intramural basketball scores, bores, and eye sores

ent to Kevin "The Warrior"
Gurski's position at free safety.
Transfer Steve Brock,
Mike Graham, Gene Kraus,
Scott Grabus, Matt Ritz, Greg
Gudis, Justin Cheseroni, Brett
Thorpe and Pete Devlin occupy
the remaining spots on the "D."
The duties ot the offen
sive coordinator will be handed
to coach John Schmid. The of
fense seems in good shade with
only two senior starters lost,
second team All-Centennial
Conference selection Brain
Willard and center Kurt Ritter.
These holes will be filled
with senior Chris Nuss, juniors
Steve Jenkins and Tim Peltier,
and sophomores Chris
Matthaei, Mike Lorge, and
Brain Pokorny. They will be
playing along side senior leader
Justin Ogorek, junior Bill
Beining, and sophomore Jack
Starkey.

The tight ends are led by
senior Mike Holm. The rest
of the offensive backfield is
filled with seasoned players,
headlined by Third Team All
American Paul Smith as full
back.

Juniors Dereck Reed and
Matt Helwig are returning
starters with Dan Sheets, Jay
Jablonski, and Brian
_Pojanowski in reserve. The re
ceivers are a veteran group.
Seniors Jeff Closz and Rob
Crowe, and junior Tighe Burns

lead the receiving corp.
The quarterback position
has returning starter Dennis
Flaherty, with contention from
senior Chris Fugaro, junior
Weston Wells, and sophomore
Jeff Boyd.
The Bullets are working

hard for the up coming season.
The most visible change for the
Bullets will be their new or
ange helmets. They are simi
lar to the helmets adorned by
the University of Syracuse.
The Bullets opponents will
soon be aware of the orange
crush. See you in the fall!

Hardcourt Harmony

The return of sophomore
Bill Davidson from a severe
ankle sprain also helped the
Bullets inside rebounding as he
contributed not only defen
sively but also grabbed some of
fensive rebounds. The Bullets
went into the locker room with
a 38-32 deficit.
fter a spectacular
alftime show by the newly
formed Basketball pep Band,
the Bullets came out charging.
Sophomore Ryan Napp (18)
and Schreiber (18) combined
for a nice inside outside game.
The Bullets again did an
excellent job of boxing out and
keeping the taller Alvernia
team off the boards. With
Napp hitting from the outside
the driving lanes were wide
open and the Bullets took ad
vantage.

Bullets shoot past Alvernia

Staff Writer

The Gettysburg College
Men's Basketball team com
pleted a great week finishing 2
1. They lost at Western Mary
land, 63-74, Wednesday night.
On Saturday, the team traveled
to Washington College and
played in what Coach George
Petrie described as the team's
best effort of the year.
The Bullets came away
with an outstanding 74-63 win.
Washington College was the
leader in the Centennial
Conference's East Division.
The Bullets then played region
ally ranked Alvernia College,
one of last year's Final Four
contenders. The Bullets went
down early but fought back to
win 77-73.
Alvernia got on top in the
game early with field goals
from Lonnie Walker their big
inside player. Alvernia got help
in the first half going 3-4 from
beyond the three-point line.

But the Bullets fought
back, shooting 13-25 or 52%
from the field. Freshman Greg
Schreiber, sophomore Rich
Pfeil, and senior Terry
Schofield all played a key de
fensive role in stopping Walker.

dunked sparking a run for the
Bullets. Down the stretch, jun
ior guard Jon Bowman did a
great job of containing the
Alvernia point guard and lead
ing scorer Damien Hunter.
Bowman, along with great de
fense from the rest of the
squad, was able to force Hunter
into taking off balanced shots.

The Bullets pulled ahead
by two with just under one
minute remaining in the game.
After several missed free throw
attempts, the Bullets were fi
nally able to hit from the line
and go up by the final score of
77-73. With these games Get
tysburg moves to 9-8 overall
and 3-3 in the conference. This
week the Bullets travel to con
ference foe Swarthmore on Sat
urday at 7:30p.m., and then
play rival Franklin & Marshall
at home on Wednesday, Febru
ary 4 with a tip-off time of
8:00p.m.
In team notes, sources
close to the team report that
the Bullets recent success has
been attributed to freshman
forward Mike Monroe's switch
to Polo socks. Very interesting.

/ think.
I know.
I will.

Olympic Spotlight

by Matthew Eisenberg
Assistant Sports Editor
On February 7, 1998
Nagano Japan welcomes 3,000
athletes from 83 countries. The
torch has been on its tour of 47
Japanese prefectures that began
on January 6, 1998. The
United States will be bringing
approximately 200 athletes, in
cluding men's and women's
snowboarding and the newest
edition to the Olympics:
women's ice hockey.
The opening ceremonies
will begin at 9 p.m. ET and the
first day of events will be pre
liminary rounds of men's ice

a.m. ET; Germany vs. Japan, 6
a.m. ET; Austria vs. Slovakia, 2
a.m. ET; France vs. Belarus, 6
a.m. ET. These teams will be
vying for two spots to battle the
hockey heavyweights such as
Team USA, Canada, and Swe-

With the addition of
NHL players entering the
Olympic mix the medals race

is clearly undecided. Team USA
is favored with strong competi
tion from Team Canada. How
ever, keep your eyes on the
mighty Czech Republic with
Dominik Hasek and Jaromir
Jagr, as well as Finland, Sweden,
and Russia all boasting all-star
rosters.
Team USA women's ice
hockey also brings an all-star
line-up and should bring home
hardware, probably the gold.
Cammi Granato, sister of Tony
Granato of the Los Angeles
Kings has an incredible resume.
She is a six-time member of U.S.
Women's National Team, one of
three players who have been
with program since inception.
Granato is also the all-time lead
ing scorer for the U.S. Women's
National Team and was named

Bullet Wrestlers continue to "take down" competition

From Staff Reports
A five march winning
streak, all against Centennial
Conference opponents, has
boosted the Gettysburg Col
lege wrestling team's overall
record to 10-6-1.
Since concluding the pre
holiday portion of its 1997-98
campaign at 2-3, Head Coach
Troy Dell's squad has won
eight matches, dropped only
three and tied one. The tie was
against Franklin & Marshall,
which fields a Division I wres
tling program, and it was a 21
12 victory over Ursinus that
jump-started the Bullets on
their current five-match win
ning streak.
The Bullets have five dual
matches remaining prior to the
Centennial Conference Cham
pionships at Swathmore on
Saturday, February 14.

Senior Jamie Binnall has
fashioned a 12-11 record at
118 pounds. Including the six
pins he has had this seasons,
Binnall's career total now
stands at 27, making him one
of only four wrestlers in
Gettysburg's history to reach
that goal.
Although a majority of
Marty Scarpato's matches this
season were at 134 pounds, the
junior has recently begun com
peting at 126. His overall
record is 18-8, including a re
cent 8-4 decision over the de
fending Centennial Conference
champion at 126, Bucky
Johnson of Ursinus. He has a
team-leading 95 takedowns
this season.
Senior Mike Ben'Ary,
who recently moved up to the
134-pound weight class from
126, has won three of his lat
est four matches to up his over
all record to 6-17.
