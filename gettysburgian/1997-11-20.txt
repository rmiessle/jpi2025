December 1-5, Center for
Public Service will sponsor AIDS
Awareness Week at Gettysburg
College.
In conjunction with World
AIDS Day, celebrated globally on
Monday, December 1, the Center
for Public Service (CPS) will spon
sor a series of events aimed at in
creasing campus awareness of the
HIV and AIDS viruses.
The programming will begin
with an opening chapel service held
at noon on Monday.
Throughout the day on Mon
day, a candlevigil will be held in
the chapel. Members of the cam
pus community are encouraged to
come in throughout the day and
light a candle for people in their
lives touched by AIDS.
Tuesday will feature a pre
sentation titled "A Positive Life,"
presented by River Houston. Hous
ton will discuss what it is like to

live with the HIV virus, and how it
has changed her perspective of life.
She will address issues of discrimi
nation and stereotyping, as well as
we fight for her rights as a woman
with HIV and her sex-positive atti
tude. Houston will speak in the
Chapel at 8 p.m.
Wednesday will feature "A
Day without Art." In a program
sponsored by Allies and the AIDS
Awareness Week committee, works
of art around campus will be cov
ered from view. This is done to re
mind the community of the large
number of artists whose lives have
been lost to AIDS.
Also on Wednesday, the
'Women's Center will hold a lunch

time program, on the issue of
Women and HIV.
Thursday, as part of the
Common Hour lecture series, the
Center for Public Service will
sponsor photographer Carolyn
Jones. Author and photographer
of Courage in the Face of AIDS,
Jones will present a slide show
capturing people of all back
grounds who are living with HIV
and AIDS.
Her slide presentation will
illustrate the self confidence and
wisdom of ordinary people coping
with an extraordinary fate, facing
their mortality, questioning their
priorities, and living life to the full
est. The face and stories of these
people aim to show that AIDS
"doesn't look like anyone - it looks
like and ultimately is all of us."
Kim Westermann of the
CPS, who is coordinating the
week's events, said that "AIDS is
something that everybody knows
about, but we've stopped talking
about."

Olmos challenges Convocation audience

by Rebecca M. Schantzenbach
Staff Writer Fall Convocation, as Presi
dent Haaland says, "a time to lis
ten, learn, and be challenged."
The campus community gathered
together last Thursday, Novem
ber 13, at 11:30 a.m. to hear Ed
ward James Olmos speak.
Olmos' topic was "We're
All in the Same Gang." He ad
dressed the importance of lan
guage, community, and diversity.
According to Olmos, part of what
makes our country so wonderful
is that we have such a wide vari
ety of nationalities and languages
living with us.
Olmos' style of speaking
was both energetic and
unorthadox. Rahter than a

diadactic lecture, he conveyed his
message through andecdotes.
"Language and communi
cation are one of the greatest gifts
we have," said Olmos. He
stressed the importance of learn
ing to speak different languages
to keep up with the world.
To Olmos, English-only is
one of the biggest mistakes we
can make. It will only serve to
hinder the upcoming generations
-it will be giving them an oppor
tunity to skip out on learning for
eign languages.
"Culture makes America
great!" Olmos said. He believes
that we must not only talk about
diversity, but teach it as well. As
far as he is concerned, we will
never become a melting pot;
"we're a salad for the duration."

"The lettuce will always be
lettuce, the tomatoes will always
be tomatoes. They can't change
their identity, but when you mix
them together, it makes some
thing delicious! Part of being
human is the fact that we all be
long together." Olmos said.
Olmos spoke of the differ
ence between what he called the
"wise selfish person" and the
"foolish selfish person."
The foolish selfish person
he described as one who "goes to
work, comes home, say their
prayers, and go to bed."
The wise selfish man, he
defined as one who does the same
thing, but "before they go to bed,
they open their door and make
sure that their neighbors are
okay."

Olmos said that when he
woke up Wednesday moring "I
looked across the street to see
if Getttysburg was okay."
Olmos noted that he was
probably the first Convocation
speaker of latin descent to
speak at Gettysburg.
Olmos feels that ulti
mately, if we can become more
understanding of the people,
if we can learn about other
views and beliefs, we will be
able to create better commu
nities and living environments.
We must prepare for the
future, both ours, our
children's, and our children's
children.
Creating a safer, more
open, and diverse society will
give us exactly what we need.

quire spring tuition payments be
fore Christmas, and students at
some institutions cannot pre-reg
ister for classes unless they pay
for the spring semester.
This is creating a dilemma

for students, who could be forced
to make an unpleasant choice: do
they pay tuition on time and lose
out on the scholarship money, or
register late and miss out on early

ing with AIDS.
Other programs for AIDS
Awareness Week include the
showing of the films "And the
Band Played On," on Monday
and "Philadelphia" on Wednes
day in the Junction, and programs
in Residence Halls designed to
raise AIDS awareness.
Westermann said that she
was very pleased with the cam
pus response to the program
ming. "We had a lot of organiza
tions involved in the volunteer ef
forts," she said.
Westermann said that
AIDS is an important issue that
the campus needs to address.
"We need to do everything we
can to keep it in the forefront,"
she said.

HOPE- from page

access to courses?
The issue also poses a
problem for colleges, who risk
cashflow, paperwork and admin
istrative problems if they actively
urge students to delay payments.
However, the alternative is
for institutions to withhold the
information and, perhaps, alien
ate their students.
"They realize it could be a
huge public relations nightmare
if they don't disclose the infor
mation," said Noah Brown of the
Association of Community Col
lege Trustees, based in Washing
ton. Under the HOPE Scholar
ship, students can receive a tax
credit of up to $1,500 annually
for the freshmen and sophomore
years of college. The program's
main target is middle-income
families, and two -parent house
holds are eligible if they earn up
to $100,000 a year. Single-par
ent families are eligible if they
earn no more than $50,000 annu
ally. And despite this fall's
flurry of activity, students and
their families will not reap any
benefits until they file tax returns.
While payments after January 1
qualify for the scholarship, fami
lies will not receive the credits
until they file their 1998 returns
— which are not due until April
1999. Because HOPE targets the
first two years of college, stu
dents now in their sophomore
years are most at risk of losing
benefits if they pay before Janu¬

ary 1. The 1998 spring is the only
time they will qualify for HOPE,
since most students will become
juniors by the fall 1998 semes
ter. An informal survey by the
National Association of College
and University Business Officers
(NACUBO) found that about half
of colleges and universities have
due dates for spring tuition pay
ments before January 1, said
Mary Bachinger, program man
ager in the association's public
policy department.
Colleges with early pay¬

ment dates face a difficult finan
cial decision, she said.
The issue poses adminis
trative problems as _welK For ex
ample, a college that allows stu
dents to pre-register now and pay
in January must change its regis
tration process. Otherwise, com
puter systems may "kick out" stu
dents if they show no record of
payment by a certain date, she
said. Another topic on the minds
of many college administrators is
how—or whether—they should
inform students and their fami
lies about the problem.
"There are a number of
schools who have taken a hard
line against disclosures, but 1
think they're in the minority,"
said Larry Zaglaniczy, associate
director of the National Associa
tion of Student Financial Aid
Administrators in Washington.
While Some institutions
may do nothing to inform stu
dents, others have sent letter to
parents, and some amy waive late
fees, he said.
In Florida, one college is
encouraging students to pay tu
ition early but does not plan to
file these paymetns until after
January 1.
Daytona Beach Commu
nity College will escrow the
spring semester tuition money,
leaving it in reserve until the new
law takes effect.
"When students register,
we strongly recommend that they
pay and lock in their schedules,"
said Philip Day, the college presi
dent. So far, colleges and univer
sities have learned HOPE will
require some major
recordkeeping changes. For ex
ample, schools eventually will
need to send names and Social
Security numbers to treasury so
the federal agency can monitor
the program, Bachiner said.

Ultimately, however, it is
students -or their family tax ad
visers- who will need to assess
their eligibility for the HOPE pro
gram. "That's something col
leges won't be able to do,"
Zaglaniczny said.

Student Senate Highlights
Nov. 17.1997

by Laura Root
Staff writer The Student Senate held
its most recent meeting last
Monday, November 17, at 7.00
p.m. in CUB 260.
First on the agenda was
voting on recognizing the
Gettysburg College
Democrats. Andrew
Zysk, the president of the club,
gave a brief presentation on his
organization.
The majority of the Stu
dent Senate then voted to rec
ognize the College Democrats.

This means that the Democrats
will be recognized next year by
Gettysburg College and receive a
budget.
The probationary status of
the Freehealth Society was also
passed. This is a club whose pur
pose would be to cater to the
needs of students who are pursu
ing health-related careers.
The Senate then discussed
the results of the student survey
that it had
distributed. Those who
filled out the surveys were mainly
concerned ahout social activities.

Students expressed a de
sire for more non-Greek activi
ties on campus over the week
ends. Among the suggestions
were moie free bands and
dorm competitions. Academic
concerns were mainly centered
around the need for more vol
umes in the library on special
ized fields.
Next Monday, there will
be a student forum that will
address the problem
of alcohol abuse. All
students are welcome to at
tend.

Mmm ... _T\irkey

by Cara Masucci
Staff Writer There is an old saying
about Thanksgiving dinner: it
takes all morning to cook, and
you're done eating it within
twenty minutes. While this
holds true for your typical fam
ily get-together, it doesn't for
the Thanksgiving dinner served
here at the dining hall on Tues
day night. That meal took al
most a month to prepare.
The dining service was
not cooking a month ago, but
believe it or not, they were
working out arrangements for
Tuesday night's feast that long
ago. During October, the din
ing service was busy ordering
the one hundred and eighty
turkeys that it would serve for
the annual Thanksgiving din
ner.

At nine thirty Tuesday
morning, before many college
students are even up, dining
hall workers were busy starting
to roast the turkeys. Accord
ing to Gary Brautigam of the
dining services, what goes un
known to the students is the
amount of time it takes to pre
pare the meal, in addition to
the other two meals of the day.
Still, the faculty does the
dinner because "they are so
geared [up] by the students."
He also went on to say the din
ner is well received by the stu
dents themselves.
This became apparent
when anybody tried to get into
the dining center on Tuesday
night. Students waited for as
long as twenty to thirty min
utes to get into the dining cen
ter. Still, everyone decided to
bear the line for the meal.

Many upperclass students
had been looking forward to
this meal for weeks, remember
ing past years of enjoyment.
Those upperclassmen who had
missed the meal in past years
were psyched for that first time.
First year students were
also greatly anticipating this
meal. Having heard about it

from their upperclass friends
for months, the big night had
finally rolled around.
The meal was a tradi
tional Thanksgiving meal.
Each table has its own turkey,
along with dressing, pitchers of
gravy, huge bowls of mashed
potatoes, rolls, cranberry
sauce, corn, cheese and
breadsticks, pumpkin pie, and
bottles of Coke, Diet Coke,
milk, and water.

Students enjoy the Thanksgiving dinner at Servo Tuesday night. The meal provided a fun
break from the normal meal routine on campus.

Those students lucky
enought to sit in the faculty
side of the dining center got
the additional pleasure of us
ing the extra-special silverware
normally reserved for faculty.
It was also a special treat
for the students to walk in and
see Gordon Haaland, college
president, and his wife greet
ing them at the door. It pro
vided a real sense of together
ness at the college.
Students were seated at
tables, and were more than
happy to have the food
brought to them, instead of
doing the usual Servo-search.
Faculty brought the food,

bringing all of the seconds/
thirds/fourths that students
could want.
It was a treat to be served
by the faculty and administra
tion of the college. There was
also a man making balloon ani
mals for students as they waited
for the coveted table.
However, some students
were chagrined at the disap
pearance of the balloon man by
the end of the evening. There

were numerous students who
had been looking forward to
getting balloon swords at the
end of the evening. However,
as they walked towards the exit,
they were greeted only with dis
appointment.
It is every student's dream
to be served by their most infa
mous professor, the one they
had been hounded by all semes
ter. Attentive to the students'
needs, every server was great
though, and brought out what
ever was needed at each table.
All comments heard from
servers were positive. Bill
Deptula, of the College's An
nual Giving department, com¬

mented, I had a wonderful
time." Serving the tables though,
must have been a treat! At the
table I was sitting at (like many
others throughout the dining
hall), we went through two
dishes of corn, a whole turkey,
and five bowls of mashed po
tatoes.
Comments heard around
the table ranged from "Good,"
to "I'm impressed," to perhaps

Photo by Emily Glatfelter

the best comment of the
evening, "I'm going to turn into
a mashed potato!"
As far as conversation
goes, it resembled regular fam
ily dinners, when topics do not
seem to make sense, and one
end of the table does not un
derstand what the other is talk
ing about. Of course, this is
understandable, what with
each table seating groups 10 or
12 people.
Students had to round up
ten of their closest friends to
head over to the dining center.
However, if students could not
schedule dinner with that many
of their friends, the staff of the

dining center would put two
groups together. This is a great
way for students to get to know
people they never would have
met before.
The Thanksgiving dinner
is always a great time for stu
dents to grow closer and cel
ebrate in the midst of papers,
exams, and stress.
No matter how much
work was left to be done, no
matter how little time was left
before that ever-present due
date, students took the time out
to go to the dining hall and
enjoy Thanksgiving with their
friends. It has become a tradi
tion. The dinner itself, which
has been going on for fifteen
years, according to John
Myers, of the dining services,
seems to be a tradition that has
been left unchanged. However,
it was discontinued several
years ago and only resurrected
once again in 1992.

The dining center was
also quick to point out how
large an effort the dinner was
on the entire campus's part.
Housekeeping loaned out
extra chairs and tables, as there
would be a larger concentra
tion of people at the dining
hall. The service fraternity Al
pha Phi Omega ran a childcare
program for faculty who
wanted to serve, but had to find
a babysitter for their children.
In the Junction, thirteen kids
had a great time and some de
cided to come to Gettysburg
College!
Every aspect of the
evening took a lot of work
from everyone on campus.
Every comment heard was a
positive one, and upon exiting,
I heard a student say, "I wish
they would do this every Sun
day night."

For the tired feet and
backs of those who served and
baked, though, I think it is bet
ter to leave it a traditional, an
nual Thanksgiving dinner!

interval, and eat them in the
theatre, not just the lobby.
As for food, the British
often use the French name:
aubergine for eggplant, mange
tout for snow peas, and
courgette for zucchini.
Certainly there are differ
ences in pronunciation:
pahstrool (pastoral), literature
(lit-er-a-ture). Just because
someone is from Britain does
not mean they're understand
able to Americans.
There are also consider
able differences in advertising.
Billboards for cigarettes are re
quired to have the equivalent
of the Surgeon General's warn
ing in very large type below the
ad, so large it seems to be part
of the ad, affecting it in subtle
ways.

Question: Where in Brit
ain would you go to get toad
in-the-hole or bubble and
squeak? Answer: To a restau
rant, of course.
Unlike French or Italian,
British food itself may be bor
ing, but the names of the reci
pes are certainly different. I say
boring because outside of stews
and pies, like steak and kidney
pie, or fish and chips, restau
rant menus are rather limited.
And potatoes are always in
cluded.
One time, we ordered a
pie of one sort or another, and
the pie contained chunks of
potatoes, was topped with
mashed potatoes, and had a side
dish of chips (chips are French
fries, on which you sprinkle
vinegar; if you want potato
chips, you want crisps).

Speaking of "chips," there
are a number of other anoma
lies in this language that both
we and the British call "En
glish." Some words have differ
ent meanings. For example,
one of the Gettysburg students
here complimented a flatmate
on her pants. The student re
plied, "How can you see
them?" Pants are on the inside;
trousers are on the outside.
Your sweater? A jumper. And
cookies? They're biscuits.
And to avoid shock, if
you're asked for a rubber, hand
over your eraser. Get your
mind out of the gutter.
It may just be different
spelling; theatre, tyre, or
colour. And the grammar is
different; collective nouns are
treated as plural, as in "The
government are..." Also, you
live in a street, not on it: "Presi
dent Haaland lives in West
Broadway."
Sometimes it's a different

word. The generic vacuum
cleaner is referred to as the
Hoover; a round-trip ticket is
a return; the oven or range is a
cooker (although that makes
sense); and intermission is the
interval.
This reminds me with re
gard to the theatre, you have to
buy a program, and you can buy
snacks and drinks during the

One we saw said some
thing like "Cross over to taste."
A person was standing on one
side of a road, looking at a pack
of a particular brand of ciga
rettes on the other side. But
the words below the ad said
"Smoking kills," and the pack
was as big as a coffin. So at
first we thought the whole
thing was an anti-smoking ad,
and maybe it is.
Advertisements can be
much more overtly sexual here.
A large poster for WonderBra
in a store showed a woman
with a sly smile wearing the bra
and saying, "Of course. Can I
bring a couple of friends?"
And a perfume ad on tele
vision: a nude male model is

stretched out in front of an art
class. A female student walks
in late and passes by him on her
way to her easel. The model
sniffs her perfume. By the look
on his face and the giggles from
the class, we know that he is,
shall we say, aroused.
Incidentally, if you've
ever wondered what the differ
ence is between England, Brit
ain, Great Britain, and the U.K.
(United Kingdom), the answer
is: England is one of the three
countries on this Island, the
others being Scotland and
Wales. Together, these three,
plus Northern Ireland, consti
tute Britain/Great Britain/the
United Kingdom; take your
pick.

Government in hot seat over global warming

by Kyle Heulitt
G.E.C.O. columnist
In the light of upcoming
gathering of countries in Kyoto
to adopt an agreement to pre
vent global warming, I figured
I would catch everyone up on
the subject.
What is it?
Global warming is the
rise in the average temperature
of the earth's climate due to the
buildup of greenhouse gases,
mainly carbon dioxide, meth¬

ane, nitrous oxide, and HFC's,
in the atmosphere.
In the past century, glo
bal concentrations of carbon
dioxide have increased by
about 30 percent, due to burn
ing coal, oil, and natural gas,
as well as deforestation.
America is responsible for the
lion's share of emissions - a
whopping quarter of the
world's total!
What does it mean to me?
Scientists predict that the

Earth's average global tempera
ture will rise by two to six de
grees Fahrenheit unless green
house gas emissions are reduced
substantially. This may not
sound like much of a rise, but
it could have a huge impact on
the ecosystem. Here are some
examples of what may be to
come: - more intense rainfall
and flooding in some area at
some times, and drought-like
conditions in others
- current rates of sea
level rise increasing by two to
five times due to both the ther¬

mal expansion of the oceans
and the partial melting of
mountain glaciers and polar ice
caps - in agriculture, predic
tions range from large drops to
large increases in crop yields,
depending on assumptions of
the temperature increase, po
tential benefits of increased car
bon dioxide, and adaptation
measures. One possibility is
that the viability of America's
"Bread Basket" may be threat
ened, as well as those farms that
depend on water from the
Ogaliata aquifer_.

- more frequent and
intense heat waves, which
would cause more deaths due
to the heat and aggravate local
air quality problems
- increase in the poten¬

tial geographic range and viru
lence of tropical disease
What can I do?
1) Buy energy-efficient
appliances and don't waste
electricity.
2) Buy cars with high
fuel efficiency, and don't drive
them unless you absolutely
have to.
3) Plant trees.
4) Weatherize your
home or apartment.
5) Tell your elected rep
resentatives what you think.
What is the US and the
rest of the world doing about
it? In 1992, the US and
roughly 150 other nations
signed the United Nations
Framework Convention on
Climate Change (FCCC) at the
Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro. The FCCC was rati
fied by the US in 1992 and has
now been ratified by ]66 na
tions altogether.

The main objective of
this treaty was the stabilize the
concentration of greenhouse
gas in the atmosphere at a level
that would prevent climactic
change.
The US and the other
most industrialized nations
agreed to voluntarily aim to
return their emissions back to
the 1990 levels by the year
2000.

However, the US and
most other industrialized na¬

tions are not on course to meet
ing this target: emissions in the
US are projected to be 13 per
cent higher in the year 2000
than they were in 1990.
Because these voluntary
targets have not been reached,
there is now widespread agree
ment that legally binding mea
sures are necessary.
This is the goal of the
talks in Kyoto, schedules for
December 1, in which repre
sentatives of countries through
out the world are scheduled to
gather and adopt an agreement.
Even though these nego
tiations are not far off, many
key elements of the agreement
remain unclear. The most im
portant topic of discussion will
be the amount of emissions to
be reduced and by when.
The plan President
Clinton announced was ex
tremely weak.

While the limits he called
for were legally binding, they
would not take effect for more
than a decade, and would only
serve to stabilize emissions.
Reductions would come much
later. Data obtained from

Conflict and Consensus
The Pachyderm's Pulpit
As if the first term weren't bad enough

by John Dunlap
Staff Writer 1997 has not been that
bad of a year for Bill Clinton.
He began his second term and
reached an agreement with the
Republican Congress over a
balanced budget, his approval
ratings have been relatively
strong, and the campaign fi
nance scandals have yet to
cause significant political or
legal damage. The President's
biggest trouble up until this
month has been the Paula
Corbin Jones sexual harass
ment suit and the president has
kept his distance while his law
yers challenge Paula Jones.
This month things have
changed for our 42nd Presi
dent. Three major defeats have
hit the Clinton Administration
and not only threaten his abil
ity to accomplish things over
the next three years, but put the

Democrats at a disadvantage
for the 1998 midterm elections.
The three defeats placed at the
Presidents hands just in the
month of November are his
defeat at the ballot box when
Republicans swept this years
key off-year elections, the de
feat of fast-track trade legisla
tion for Chile, and the rejection
of the president's Nominee to
be the Assistant Attorney Gen
eral for Civil Rights, Bill Lann
Lee. These three defeats not
only are evidence that the Bresi
dents reelection honeymoon is
over but has led political com
mentators to wonder if lame
duck status has hit Bill Clinton.
It seems that in the six
years since Bill Clinton first
became a Candidate for the
Presidency of the United States,
the only Democrat he has
helped is himself. Virtually
every other Democrat who he

has campaigned for has gone
down in defeat. The Demo
crats' hold on Congress was
broken and Republicans are
still winning in state elections
during the Clinton era. Things
looked like they might have
changed in 1997. The Presi
dent was the first Democrat to
have a second term since
Franklin Roosevelt, the
economy was strong and the
general feeling in the country

has been generally good. In
stead, every candidate _^^^
who the ~^^^^

President cam
paigned
for went
down to
defeat. In
New Jer
sey with
t h e
Demo
cratic Nominee for Gov
e r n o r ,
State Senator J i m
McGreevy

the Presi
dent said that the New Jersey
Governor's race would help de
cide which direction the coun
try would move in. The incum
bent Republican Governor
Christine Todd Whitman,
pulled out a close victory, even
with 7% of pro-life voters leav
ing the Republican Party for
two pro-life candidates. In Vir
ginia the President with his
party's Gubernatorial Candi
date there, Lieutenant Gover
nor Don Beyer, called voters
who would vote for the Repub
lican Candidate Former State
Attorney General, Jim
Gilmore. selfish. The reason

behind this attack was that the
cornerstone of the Gilmore
campaign was the repeal of the
personal property tax on cars
and trucks. The President and
Don Beyer lost and the Repub
lican Party and Jim Gilmore
won. Not only did the GOP
keep Virginia's Governorship,
but also captured all three

statewide gov
ernment of
fices, a first

F i -
nally, in New York the Presi
dent visited to help the respec
tive Democrat Candidates for
Mayor of New York City and
for a U.S. House seat but the
Democrats lost in both races
overwhelmingly.
On Capital Hill Senate
Republicans challenged the
president's Civil Rights nomi
nee, Bill Lann Lee and now the
President is forced to either
withdrawal Mr. Lees nomina
tion or to fight for him in a
battle that he probably will be
unable to win. The Senate Ju
diciary Committee refused to
recommend Mr. Lee to the full

Senate over affirmative action
and quotas. Bill Lann Lee made
a big mistake early on when he
said that he would not uphold
lower court decisions regarding
quotas and set-asides. When he
made that remark the President
should have
dumped _^^^^^

_^^_r him.
The
purpose of
an Assistant
Attorney Gen¬

eral is to enforce
the law whether you
agree with the law or
not; if you fail to do that
than you should be replaced.
Democrats are charging Repub
licans with racism, which is
petty and stupid. I disagree
with Mr. Lee and the President
on principle not race and if the
Democrat Party is so devoid of
ideas that it must resort to piti
ful name calling then President
Clinton better get the minor
ity party in Congress in line or
trouble lies ahead come elec¬

tion day 1998.
Recently, the only thing
the Democrats in Congress
seem to be in line about is op
position to the President him
self. Bill Clinton's biggest
problems may not come from
Republicans but from within
his own party. On the fast
track legislation the President
joined Congressional Republi
cans while 80% of House
Democrats opposed the presi
dential position on free trade.
Free trade is good for America
because it creates jobs and al¬

lows for Americans to be the
first to enter new markets. The
economies of Latin America are
growing and by entering into
trade pacts with Chile and
other Latin American countries
than that allows us to get ahead
of our economic competitors to
get the goods into new and ex
panding markets. Organized
labor has taken over the Demo
cratic Caucus in the Congress
and the President of the A.F.L.
John Sweeney seems to have
more influence among Demo
crats in Congress than the
President of the United States
has. House Speaker Newt
Gingrich battled for the votes
on fast-track but the President
failed to deliver his side and
Chile and other nations south
of the Rio Grande will begin
looking elsewhere for eco
nomic trade.

Presidential second terms
have been historically worse
than first terms. President
Eisenhower faced a recession in
term number two, President
Nixon was forced to resign
over Watergate in his second
term, and President Reagan
faced Iran-Contra after his re
election. Bill Clinton may now
begin to face the trouble that
comes with a second term.
Now is the time that President
Clinton must cement his legacy
and up to this point it seems as
if scandals, the decline of lib
eralism, and the rise of the Re
publican Party is his hallmark.
If that remains so, than come
1998 and 2000 Bill Clinton
will be a liability on the Demo
cratic Candidates, and that
does not spell good news for
Democratic hopes of winning
back Congress.

Consider this

AIDS is a reality in all of
our lives.
As tragic as this illness is,
the fact that we continue to ig
nore the presence of AIDS in
our lives is far more unfortu¬

nate. Often, given our youth
and our relative inexperience,
we tend to think of ourselves as
invincible, choosing to block out
reality with the familiar and
comforting shroud of believing
that AIDS will never happen to
us or anyone close to us.
However, the harsh real
ity is that, every one of us will
know someone who will die of
this disease, and chances are,
many of us will know numerous
casualties of this disease.
As we go about our daily
lives, we are faced with a frus
trating dichotomy of being in
one of the most free times of our
lives, yet also being bound with
a heavy weight of responsibil
ity. While in general our stu
dent body is unjustly accused of
being apathetic, when it comes
to the reality of AIDS in our
lives, we are.

Most of the student body
knows what AIDS is, and given
our educational background,
most of us could give a list of
facts and figures about the dis
ease. However, it is only the ce¬

rebral statistics that we know
and not the emotional connec
tion that completely draws us
into a grim reality of the AIDS
epidemic.
We have to stop hiding
behind the cold hard facts, and
face the reality of AIDS. This
disease will pervade our lives,
affect our friends, maybe even
affect ourselves.
Since our generation is re
ally the first to get all of the facts
on AIDS, it is our responsibility
to take the initiative to continue
to learn and accept this disease.
Take the time to learn, a
little more about AIDS. Learn
more than just how it is trans
mitted and take the time to re
alize that AIDS is something hu
man, and its victims need our
support.

In short, take the time to
care. Don't wear a red ribbon
because it is fashionable, wear
it because you truly care about
AIDS and what it is doing to
those who mean something to
us. All of us are privileged to
be here at an institution of
higher learning, and we repre
sent the leaders of tomorrow.
Our time is coming. We can
teach others about AIDS, and
raise everyone's awareness.
Through our own education, we
can make a difference.

Conflict and Consensus

To the Editor:

I was very alarmed by
the content of "Be Your Own
Best Defense" by Jay Spiese,
an article in the November 13,
1997 edition of The Gettys
burgian. In some ways the
subtitle for the article "Being
responsible for yourself is the
best solution" sums up every
thing that was wrong with the
article.
I am grateful and
pleased that Mr. Spiese
brought attention to this very
important issue. It certainly
is a topic that has become a
reality for all members of the
Gettysburg College commu
nity. However, I am skeptical
of the research Mr. Spiese did
for his article. For example
the fifth "absolute truth" as it
states in the article is "You
[directed to the victim! are the

only person who can prevent
rape." This statement could
not be more false. Two people,
both the victim and perpetra
tor, can prevent a rape. Addi
tionally, this statement puts the
blame on the victim because it
sends the message that if it hap
pens to you, it is because you
did not do enough to prevent
it. Additionally, "absolute
truth" number five says that "I
can't describe how appalled I
am to hear that women are be
ing taught 'If I fight back he will
only hurt me more.'" Frankly,
Mr. Spiese, the reality is that
in a rape situation the perpe
trator often threatens the vic
tim with further violence
should the victim protest in any
way. Sometimes the best deci
sion is to fight back, sometimes

it is not. There are no "abso
lute truths" in highly volatile,
dangerous situations.
With the proposed posi
tive consent policy introduced
recently, Gettysburg College is
recognizing that both people
need to take responsibility for
their actions. Women are tired
of being declared the victim
and men are frustrated by ac
cusations that they are mon
sters. We need to make sure
that we remember that rape is
something that occurs between
two people, regardless of gen
der, and that communication
and responsibility of both
people is truly the "best solu
tion." Sincerely,
Lindsay S. Musser, '98

Conflict and Consensus

Sci-fi facist?

by James Shrader
Contributing Writer
Most people who have seen
Starship Troopers probably have
noticed a fascist tone to the futur
istic society of Starship Troopers
that is both dark and satirical.
Critics have blasted it, and some
viewers have reacted negatively to
it. In the movie, there were some
what comical newsreels interjected
throughout that would appear to
be there at least for satire, but
Verhoeven based some of these
newsreels on Nazi propaganda
films, such as the one where the
voice is asking citizen, "What have
they done?"
Beyond these newsreels
there are darker links to Nazism,

such as the fact that one of the
main characters, who works for in
telligence, wears a black leather
overcoat and other nazi-like para
phernalia (I remember overhear
ing someone who was leaving say
ing, "How ironic, they have
people who are in charge of de
stroying a race looking like the Ge
stapo!") . Many images in this
movie reek of a totalitarian state:
first and second class citizens, ex
tremely harsh punishment in the
military, such as using a whip for
corporal punishment, and con
stant linking of the army to regu
lar society (not only during the
war, before it too), and ultimately
violence being the solution to
problems.

Paul Verhoeven and the
screenwriters seem to have missed
the philosophy of what Robert A.
Heinlein was trying to get across.
However this would not be the
first time, as Heinlein's original
publisher refused to published the
work, citing the fact that
Heinlein's principles of a futuris
tic society were fascist. This
caused Heinlein to drop the pub
lisher and go with a new one. This
instance seems to be the first in a
long chain of misinterpretations
that have culminated in
Verhoeven's translation of Starship
Troopers.
The underlining philosophy
of Starship Troopers was not about
a fascist government as Utopia.
What Heinlein was trying to get
across in Starship Troopers were
the ideals of responsibility, duty,
and sacrifice, which by themselves
are in no way fascist. In the novel,

through his narration and dia
logue, Heinlein argues repeatedly
for these principles. For instance
one of his characters bemoans
welfare, argue in essence no one
should get a free ticket, and instead
should earn what they receive.
This is not surprising coming from
a man who, much to the chagrin
of fellow science fiction writers,
was a conservative.
Heinlein was strongly
against totalitarian governments.
For instance, he was against gun
control because he believed guns
were a useful deterrent to an op
pressive government. In his nov
els The Moon is a Harsh Mistress,
and Revolt in 2100, citizens revolt
against tyrannical governments
One of my favorite quotes was by
Heinlein on censorship, "Don't
make the adult drink the milk be
cause the baby can't eat the steak."
These facts alone should be
enough to dissuade any critic that
Heinlein was a fascist.

Probably one of the biggest
ironies of accusing Heinlein of
being a fascist, is the fact that the
revolutionary novel Stranger in a
Strange Land became an icon of
the sixties movement and pro
moted such ideals as acceptance,
love, and linking people and God
("Thou art God")
In the end the sarcastic por
trayal of Heinlein's vision only
ends up collapsing upon itself.
There is nothing wrong of course
with responsibility, duty, and sac
rifice, and it would seem
Verhoeven's portrayal and critics'
responses to Starship Troopers are
paranoid responses to anything
close to fascism, no matter how re
mote. Heinlein's ideals should be
looked upon like required commu
nity service, like in my highschool,
which in part made me a better
person while helping those in
need.

I suggest people read
Starship Troopers, not only be
cause it is an excellent novel, but
also to draw their own conclu
sions. I also suggest reading other
Heinlein novels, such as Stranger
in a Strange Land, none of which
promote fascism in my opinion.

Advances in computer architectures
and networks are bringing parallel
computing to more than the typical
users of supercomputers. Unfortu
nately, programmers quickly find that
writing and verifying correct parallel
programs is a much more difficult
task than writing sequential pro
grams. One of the most important
challenges in parallel computing is
providing programmers with software
tools like the tools they currently
enjoy for sequential programming. In
particular, there is a lack of software
testing tools for this paradigm of
programming. In this talk, we will
examine how the intrinsic nature of
parallel programs complicates the
task of providing software tools to
parallel programmers. A brief
overview of the state-of-lhe-art will
be presented. All students and
faculty are invited.

His shoes were made for running
... AND THAT'S JUST WHAT THEY'LL DO

By Chesha Miller
Staff Writer Putting his all into every
thing he does, senior Jason
Smith generates great results. As
a three season athlete, running
cross country, indoor and out
door track, it is a wonder how
Jason finds the time to partici
pate in all his activities. For the
second consecutive year Jason,
who is fondly known as Jay to
his teammates and friends, is a
Residence Assistant.
He is also a member of
Students for Ethical Action
(SEA), Bacchus and Allies. "I try
to get involved with as much as
I can and am supportive of the
groups [on campus] I believe
in," he commented. In addition,
Jason is a Teacher's Assistant for
a math and a computer science
class. Smith, who has been a TA
since his sophomore year, really
enjoys being able to help out in
the classroom.

When it comes down to it
though, Jason's favorite activity
has been running. "Running is
something I always need to do,"
he explained, "I love what I get
from running; it soothes me and
is a stress relief, and I am able
to be with the team I love." He
also loves the feeling of being in
shape and of constantly improv
ing and competing against him
self. Smith began his running
career as a seventh grader and
has continued to run ever since.
In high school Jason ran for
Council Rock High School,
where he struggled to make the
varsity team. Gettysburg Cross
Country and Track and Field
coach Robert Condon attributes
Jason's struggle to overtraining.
When Smith came to Gettysburg
in 1994 his luck began to
change.

Running half the per week
mileage he had run in high
school, Jason was running at the
top of Gettysburg's varsity team.
During Smith's first year, the
team, which he was a key part
of, qualified for the National
Division III Cross Country
Championships. That season
Jason was named to the All-Re
gional freshmen team.
As a sophomore, Smith
finished 15th and 25th, respec
tively, at the Centennial Confer¬

ence and Regional Cross Coun
try Championships. The follow
ing year he improved his perfor
mance, in a conference and re
gion which becomes more com
petitive each year, to 13 and 22
place, respectively.
During his junior year, Ja
son, who was a captain of the
cross country team, was awarded
the Captain Michael D. Scotton
scholarship award. The award is
given annually to a junior run
ner who demonstrates a high de
gree of extracurricular activity
and diligence to his academic
work. The recipient is chosen by
the coach and athletic director.
Jason was also honored that fall
for having had the highest GPA
among athletes in the spring of
1996, an honor which he shared
with teammate George Torgun.
Because of his superior academic
and athletic performance, Smith
was named to the coaches asso
ciation Academic All-American
team his sophomore, junior and

years.
This season, his final for
cross country, Smith ran at the
top of Gettysburg's tight pack of
runners. At the Centennial Con
ference championships, Jason ran
with his whole heart through the
treacherous rain and mud.
Smith's performance was one of
his best, he finished second for
Gettysburg and ninth in the race.
He earned second team All-Cen
tennial Conference honors for
hisaccomplishment.
This past weekend at the
Regional Championships held at
Dickinson College, Jason moved
his way up from the third to the
first runner on Gettysburg's
team. Smith, who had a very
good cross country season, ended
on a positive note finishing 34th
in the region.

Prior to the regional race
Smith said, "I would like to fin
ish regionals and be proud of
what we've done. I don't con
centrate on winning, I don't like
to label goals. I'll be psyched if
we do the best we can." Jason
has every reason to be psyched.
Smith is also looking forward to
the upcoming track season. "I
had a great season last year," he
noted, "and I'd like to do that
again, I'm really excited about
it." Condon has been really im¬

pressed with Smith's running.
"He has run number one on a
team with a lot of comparable
talent," Condon commented.
"I _always know Jason
Smith is going to run really well."
With cross country behind him,
Condon must now look towards
the track season. He has high
hopes for Jason to continue to
be a presence on the team and
to have a rewarding, worth while
spring semester.
"I hope Jason is able to see
some more personal records be¬

fore he leaves. I know we
haven't tapped into all of his abil
ity yet and I'd like him to leave
saying he's done the most he
can." Condon also believes
Smith to be one of the best lead
ers and captains the team has
ever had. "He is a good leader
because he is a positive person,"
explained Condon. "Jay has a
high energy level and is funda
mentally happy. He knows if you
want to be happy, you have to
be happy first and then figure
your problems out."

For Jason, part of figuring
his problems out is finding the
time to balance all of his activi
ties. Condon believes Jason is
able to focus and achieve so
much because of his "keen and
focused intelligence." Condon
said, "[Jay] focuses on the impor
tant issues at hand and because
he is bright he is able to work
fast. He also has very good time
management skills."
Jason does not think about
how he manages to have the time
to do all he does, he simply does

it. "It's never been that hard to
do," Smith explained, "It's set in
my mind practice is from 4 until
6:30 every day and Saturday is
always for running, it's not us
able time. I have always been
able to get everything done." Ja
son also explained how he puts
all of himself into everything he
does. "I hate to short change one
thing for another. I am very fo
cused and I want to do the best I
can do. "[Running] has been a
lot of fun and a great part of my
experience at school," Jason
commented.

It has given me so many
memories. Some of my best
friends are on the team, that is
something really significant."
Though Jason is going to miss

the team very much, he is now
moving on to bigger things.
Smith, who is physics
and math double major, with
a minor in computer science,
is looking towards graduate
school. He would like to get
his Ph.D. and apply all he has
learned in math, physics and
computer science, as that is
what he loves to do.
In the meantime, most
importantly, Jason is busy
planning his June wedding
with fiance Helen DeVinney.

machine.

Smith's outlook on life ema
nates upon his fellow team
mates and coaches.
He will be sorely
missed. In talking about
coach/athlete relationships,
Condon said, "I don't know
how much he really needed
from me. It is entirely pos
sible he's affected me more.
He is a real joy to coach and
I will miss him."
Condon does believe
Smith will continue to influ
ence the cross country and

track teams after he has gone
because of what he has instilled
in the younger runners. "He
will leave a legacy on the team,"
said Condon.

The hardest running man on campus

by Rob Thompson
Contributing Writer/ B.A.S.S
member Name: Alex Franyo
Age: 21
Sports: Cross Country
& Track
Major: Theatre Arts
Year: Junior
Hobbies/Interests: 70's
& 80's Music, Sports
(especially college)
From across one of
Gettysburg's quads you may
hear a distinctive voice calling
out a familiar phrase: "How
ya doing buddy?" Instantly you
know it's the voice of the run
ning machine, "Big Al" Franyo.
Alex is a member of both the
Cross Country and Track
Teams, and loves to compete in
long distance races.

Alex first became inter
ested in running when he was
a freshmen in high school at St.

Paul's in Baltimore. Always
being interested in sports, he
would frequently visit coaches
and talk to them about their
teams. Once, when speaking
to the Cross Country Coach, he
was asked if he would be inter
ested in being the team's man
ager. After a year of helping
the team with water and tim
ing, he new that the following
year he'd be running too.
Last year was Alex's first
chance to compete at the col
lege level due to an injury prior
to his first year at Gettysburg.
Unfortunately, early in this sea
son, he reinjured his leg, hav
ing a stress fracture in his left
tibia. Right now he's staying
in shape by using a step ma
chine where he does a cardia
vascular work out. Soon he
plans to start running short dis
tances and gradually move up
to longer distances once more.
Recently Alex has be
come very involved with the

theatre program, even declar
ing Theatre Arts his major.
Alex draws many of his running
experiences to the theatre and
vise versa. "They're both simi
lar in that both acting and
sports are entertaining, you're

always in the spotlight. Both
are a motivation for life," Alex
says. "Running is an art," he
proclaims.
Alex hopes that his train
ing in both running and the

theatre will help him accom
plish his goal in life, being a
sports broadcaster on ESPN.
Look to see Big Al in the fu
ture, because HE COULD GO

Cross country runs all over the competition

By Peter Huminski
Staff Writer Determined is one word
that is often used to describe a
distance runner. This adjective
is a good word to be used in
describing the Gettysburg Col
lege cross country teams.
The Bullet cross country
teams' seasons, which began in
August, came to an end Satur
day when both the men's and
women's teams competed in
the NCAA Mid-East Regional
Meet at Dickinson College.
Having to overcome in
juries, illness, and the weather
both teams competed hard.
The men's team finished 8 in
the 41 team field; while the
women finished 14 out of 43

.
Leading the way for the
Gettysburg women was senior
Wendy Johnston who finished

18. Her finish earned her a spot
on the All Mid-East Regional
cross country. Her time of
19:53 was just eight seconds off
of qualifying individually for
the NCAA championships to be
held in Boston this weekend.
"I thought that going into
it that since we were coming off

of some illness, if we stayed in
the top 15 I would be happy,
and we did that," said Bullets
coach Robert Condon. "We
had some people that have
been ill and that hurts. We
aren't ten people deep, so we
can't afford to have important
people sick for these kinds of

meets.
Suffering from a back in
jury senior Martie Calello fin
ished second for the Bullets and
65th overall in a time of 20:56.
Rounding out the rest of the
Bullet harriers were Joyce
O'Neil (88, 21:29), Kelley
Lord (152, 22:37), Karen
Helmick (168, 22:54), Kristin
Mills (172, 22:59), and Kim
Heimerl (195, 23:39).
In the men's race, senior
Jason Smith started out in the
middle of the pack and worked
his way up to lead the Bullets
with his thirty-second place fin
ish. He covered the 8000
meter course in 27:24 good
enough for a spot on the All
Mid-East Regional team.
"Jason Smith was really
strong for us," said Condon.
"He started out in the middle
of the pack and came on really
strong at the end. He did a
great job for us."

Kris Weum was the Bul
lets number two finisher com
ing across the line thirty-sixth
place in a time of 27:31. James
Smith (48t, 27:46), Jon Catlett
(61, 28:05), Brendon Clark
(70, 28:14), Dave Gary (98,
28:39) and Brina Rusignolo
(180, 30:42) rounded out the
Bullets top seven.
"Jon did a really great
job," said Coach Condon. " I
was really happy with his per
formance, considering he had
been laid up so long with inju
ries." Catlett's finish place him
on the All Mid-East Regional
freshmen team. He was the
seventh freshman to cross the
finish line.
"On a decent day we
would have been in the top
five," said Condon. "I can't
fault guys who are sick. They
ran hard and I am happy about
that."

will be played Saturday (No
vember 22) in Gettysburg,
starting at noon.

The Bullets enter
Saturday's game riding a 15
game unbeaten streak, the
longest in school history. With
a victory on Saturday, they
would tie a school record for

goal against Muhlenberg, scor
ing 2:02 into the second over

gory Stevcic, (Medford, NJ) has
supplied the Bullets with 12
goals and 15 assists so far dur

Senior Midfielder Brian
Hill (Odenton, Md) and
sophmore forward Jason
Vishio (Reading, Pa), have con
tributed seven goals.
Midfielder Jeremy Shapiro,
(Leonia_, NJ) is the leading
scorer among freshman with
four goals and three assists.

Bullets get ball rolling

From Gettysburg Press release
With no less than 12 let
ter winners and all five starters
from last years 13-12 team,
Gettysburg College head
women's basketball coach
Mike Kirkpatrick has a bright
future.
The only draw back that
he faces in the opening basket
ball, tournament this week at
Frostburg State is the fact that
two players just joined the team
from the women's NCAA
bound soccer team, and several
are still studying abroad and
won't be back until January.
Gettysburg will compete
in the McDonald's Classic at
Frostburg, facing host
Frostburg Friday afternoon in

the 4 p.m. second game.
Kenyon will play Montclair
State in the 2 p.m. opener. The
consolation game will be
played Saturday at 2:00 p.m.
followed by the 6:00 p.m.
championship game.
Junior Megan Malloy has
returned from overseas, but has
missed several weeks of work
outs. She paced the Bullets
with 11.2 points and 9.9 re
bounds per game a year ago.
Courtney Marotta, will
not return until January. The
three remaining starters should
be ready to go this weekend.
They include Jaime Dawson,
Jen Dravis, and Julie
Hawthorne. All of this ladies
played a signifigant role last
season and will continue this

season.
Jen Dravis averaged 13.1
points per game, while twin sis
ter Steph came off the bench
to average 9.8 tallies a contest.
Waiting in the wings _alons with
Dravis will be sophomre
Lauren Frankford, sophmore
Carrie Kulp, and senior Beth
O'Boyle.
This year's schedule
should also help Kirkpatrick in
the early season preparation of
his team. Following the tour
nament, Gettysburg plays three
of it next four games on the
home court before breaking for
Christmas. When they return
on January 9 and 10, the Bul
