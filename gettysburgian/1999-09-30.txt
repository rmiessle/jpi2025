Drinking on campus: not
as simple as you think

By Kristine Meier
Staff Writer
As the new academic year has
come into full swing, so has the social
scene here at Gettysburg College.
Within the past few

weeks, there have
been many investi
gations and charges
against individuals
and organizations
that reflect this.
"What ex
actly are the rules
for parties?" many
might be asking.
There are several
rules that the col
lege has, along with
the state, and the
FIPG, or Fraternity
Insurance Group
for fraternities and
organizations to
follow.
The college
requires that all
campus events with
10 or more stu
dents where alco¬

hol is present, must be reported. Kegs
and all tap-dispensing equipment are
prohibited. Parties are to occur be
tween 5 p.m. Friday and 11 p.m. Sun
day night only.

Some
of the rules
for the ac
tual party
include
that at least
two regis
tered serv
ers, who
pass a col-

"Whenever a fraternity gets into trouble,
it not only has to deal with the college, but
their alumni and national fraternity as well."
-Dean Murphy

lege server
training program, may serve alcohol
and must be at a party at all times. For
parties with over 200 people, a hired
security guard must be present and for

each additional 100 people, a college
staff member must attend. Students who
are over 21 must be stamped, given a
wristband, or other sign to show that
they are of age at a party.
"Whenever a fraternity gets into
trouble, it not only has to deal with the

ties. Besides rules for parties, the Col
lege also has guidelines for BYOB
events. A person who is 21 may only
take a six-pack of 12 oz. beer or four
wine coolers to a BYOB event. The al
cohol then must be given to a

college, but their alumni and national
fraternity as well," said Dean Murphy
from the Office of Greek Life.
He also added that this year, the
College is trying to promote other as¬

pects of fraternities besides the social
scene. Some fraternities are sponsoring
educational speakers and other academic
events here on campus to try to escape
the idea that all they are about is par-

registered server who will
distribute it accord
ing to cer
tain rules
through
out the
evening.
The
above
were just
a few of
t h e
college's
guide
lines , but
you still
might be
wonder
ing what
the FIPG
is and
what role
it has

over fraternities' parties. It is a group
that establishes a set of rules that each
fraternity needs to sign and promise to
abide. Some of their guidelines are gen
eral, including "no serving or purchas¬

ing of alcohol to minors as is
similar to the federal and col
lege guidelines. No alcohol can
be purchased through a
chapter's treasury, nor can any
fraternity co-sponsor a party
with an alcohol distributor, tav
ern, or charitable organization.
Neither the Office of
Greek Life nor Safety and Se¬

curity would give out the
names of the fraternities that were or
are under investigation. In fact, several
sources refused to give out any infor
mation whatsoever.

Campus crime thrives across the nation

By William Lee
Campus Correspondent
Western Illinois
University
DETROIT (TMS) — A
former Wayne State University
student who admitted killing
his professor in a university
classroom will face a manda
tory life sentence at his sentenc
ing next month.
Wlodzimierz Dedecjus,
49, was found guilty Sept. 28
of first-degree murder in the
shooting death of fellow Pol
ish immigrant Andrzej Olbrot
last December. Olbrot, 52, an
internationally known expert
in electrical engineering, was
administering a final exam
when Dedecjus entered the
classroom, pulled a collapsible
rifle from a black bag and fired
at least eight shots at him. Ac
cording to The Detroit News,

Dedecjus reloaded his rifle and
fired once more into the back
of Olbrot's head.
Dedecjus surrendered to
Ann Arbor, Mich., police Dec.
10, about six hours after the
shooting. Prosecutors said he
killed Olbrot two days after
learning he had failed a doc
torate qualifying exam, and a
psychologist said Dedecjus was
delusional and believed Olbrot
was out to humiliate him.
Olbrot's ex-wife, Marga
ret Parker-Olbrot, said Olbrot
had told her Dedecjus was a
slower student who often
sought help. Olbrot frequently
spent time helping Dedecjus
work on papers and projects,
she said.
"His pride and his lust to
achieve drove him to kill,"
Parker-Olbrot told the Detroit
Free Press. "Why? What did he
achieve doing this? He took
Andrzej's life, and he took his.
life, too."

CHAMPAIGN, III.
(TMS) — Given all the arrests
for underage drinking during
the University of Illinois' Sept.
24 "Sibling Weekend," you
gotta wonder just what Illinois
students were teaching their
brothers and sisters.
Police reported that 58
people were arrested for drink
ing underage — arrests that
raked in fines totaling $14,650.
Sibling Weekend is noto
rious for having a high num
ber of arrests. According to the
Daily Mini, the upside of this
year's festivities was that the
number of arrests was down
from last year when about 100
underage drinkers were
nabbed.
"This is the first time I've
gotten caught," Shanna
Andler, 19, told the Daily Mini.
"I kind of expected it to hap
pen sooner. I was only 17 when
I started school here and never
got caught then."

IRVINE, Calif. (TMS) —
Faculty at the University of
California at Irvine got a scare
Sept. 15 when a school em
ployee drove his van through
two offices in the university's
administration building.
According to the New
University, the van crashed into
the vacant rooms, shattering
windows and damaging walls.
No one was injured in the acci
dent, with the exception of the
van's driver, John Ihescu, who
suffered neck and back injuries.
Police are trying to deter
mine how and why the driver
rammed the van he was driv
ing into the building.
"It sounded like two
trucks had collided," said Ruth
Quinnan, graduate studies fi
nance manager, whose office
was two doors away from the
scene of the accident.

EAST LANSING, Mich.
(TMS) — The body of a former
Michigan State University stu
dent was found Wednesday,
SeDt. 22 in the basement of an

MSU residence hall.
The body, which school
officials said was found in an
"unused refrigerating unit" in
the residence hall, was identi
fied as 23-year-old Neftali
Valdez Greene Jr. According to
the Michigan Daily, initial po
lice reports stated that Greene's
death was accidental and re
sulted from suffocation. Toxi
cology reports will determine
the exact cause of Greene's
death. So far, police have ruled
out foul play.
Greene was a student at
MSU between January 1997
and May 1998. School officials
said they were not sure why he
was on campus.

PRINCETON, N .J.
(TMS) — In what appeared to
be a scene borrowed from the
movie Studio 54, _^n unidenti
fied man, upset that he couldn't
get into a Princeton-area club,
giabbed a boaid from building
overhang and threw it through
a window.
The Sept. 24 incident in
jured a Princeton student who
was on the other side of the
window in the club's coatroom.

Florida A&M getting used
to heightened security
after campus bombings

By Merissa Green
The Famuan
TALLAHASSEE - It's not
unusual for Florida A&M Uni
versity students, faculty and
staff to have their campus iden
tification, commonly known as
the Rattler Card, in a wallet,
on a key chain or tucked in a
purse. Until recently, faculty and
staff have needed it only to get
through gated parking lots, and
students have needed it to eat
in the campus cafeteria or to
check out books from the li
brary. Earlier this week, how¬

ever, Famuans had to start
wearing Rattler Cards around
their necks to gain full access
to campus. Two bombings in
men's bathrooms at the univer
sity — one on Aug. 31, the
other on Sept. 22 — remain a
mystery to police and continue
to scare the surrounding com
munity. "It's crazy," said
sophomore Terrance Knight, a
19-year-old criminal justice
major. "We have to study in
fear. We can't Course instruc
tors spent a good portion of
this week's class time review
ing evacuation plans in the
event of another bombing, and
students and faculty were

forced through checkpoints set
up on major arteries leading to
and from campus. Since the
second explosion, all of the
university's buildings have
closed at 10 p.m. Anyone want
ing to enter after that hour
must pass a security guard.
"We're not trying to inconve
nience anyone, but we are try
ing to provide for public secu
rity," said Tim Moore, commis
sioner of the Florida Depart
ment of Law Enforcement.
So far, police have few
leads, and, as of Wednesday
have made no arrests. As the
investigation of the two explo
sions continues, school officials
have taken several steps to pre¬

vent a third bombing. In addi
tion to displaying Rattler
Cards, anyone affiliated with
the university must have a park
ing decal on his or her car to
be able to travel anywhere on
FAMU's 500 acres of hilly land.
The bombings have re
ceived much state and national
attention. Florida Gov. Jeb
Bush has approved $200,000 in
state money to increase the
number of law enforcement
officers on campus to 50 and
to install security cameras in
each of the university's 119
buildings. The Rev. Jesse Jack
son led a prayer vigil with
1,300 people from the FAMU
and Tallahassee communities at

a local Baptist church Sunday
night to show support for the
university. And thanks to pri
vate citizens, reward money for
information leading to an arrest
has swelled to $60,000.
Tighter security was
implemented immediately after
the second explosion, which
blasted away the ceiling of a
men's restroom. Shortly before
both blasts a caller, believed to
be a white male, telephoned a
local television station warning
about the devices and making
racist remarks.
Animal Science professor
Pamela Hunter, whose office is
located in the same building
where the second explosion
happened, said she considered
staying home but knew she
needed to show up in class for
her students.
"I didn't want them to
win," Hunter said of the
bomber or bombers. "I didn't
want my students' education to
be spoiled."

While the explosions
have been unnerving, students
must continue to focus on their
studies, said senior Danielle
Owens, who missed being in
the same building as the second
explosion by only a few min
utes. "I try not to think about
it," she said. "Classes have to
go on."

China. Friday marks the

TALLAHASSEE, Fla.
(TMS) — Florida A&M stu
dents and the entire Tallahas
see-area is still reeling from the
bombing that took place on
campus Sept. 22.
It was the second explo
sion to strike the campus this
month. Authorities suspect the
two bombings — the first of
which happened Aug. 31 — are
related.
No one was injured dur
ing either bombing attack.
School officials said they are
making the safety of students
and faculty the university's top
priority.

"I'm concerned about the
safety of our students," FAMU
President Frederick S.
Humphries said. "I have
planned a meeting with the
appropriate law enforcement
officials to urge them to use all
available resources in order to
apprehend the individual or
persons responsible. We must
be allowed to carry out our
education mission in a safe and
secure environment that is con

According to the Talla
hassee Democrat, a bomb
threat called into Channel 27
shortly before the explosion
has lead authorities to consider
this a racially-motivated crime,
due to the caller's use of racial
slurs and vulgarity.
In addition, authorities
continue to monitor the area
due to the caller's suggestions
that more explosions should be
expected.

Erin is rapidly
making a name for
herself, redefining
contemporary folk
music - her way.
"It's all about forg

style... building
your own mold,"
says 21-year-old
Erin. "She's going
to conquer the
world," says Ann
Rabson, Alligator

would later say, "Rose exists on a level
all her own...botanical love songs...dark
histories...as holy as a mystic, as pro

In August of 1998, Rose indepen
dently released her debut album
Dragersville, a self-produced collection
of eleven original songs. Since its re
lease, she has been touring almost in
cessantly, making a stop at the ASCAP

Friday night, Gettysburg College
Coffeehouse will present Rose
Polenzani at 10 p.m. She will be joined
by special guest Erin McKeown. Both
performers visited Gettysburg this
spring as part of Voices on the Verge.
Polenzani's first major effort as a
musician was a full-length, four-track
album entitled "vast chest," of which
ten copies were made. Rose devoted
so much time to the project, completed
as part of an off-campus college arts
program, that her professors gave her
A's in every class, despite her virtual
neglect of other course work. They
decided that she had learned how to be

an artist.
She took their cue and left college
to immerse herself in the Chicago open
mic music scene. At age 20, she was
working as a bookstore clerk and at
tending three open mics
a week. Her voice
cracked like an egg in an
incubator, even though • • •
(or maybe because) there
was virtually no one
there to notice. She stayed loyal to the
open mic experience for two years be
fore embarking on her first tour, which
took her to the Northeast in the winter
of 1997.
Within seven months, she would
be invited to play the Newport Folk
Festival, winning a slot in the 1998 sum

Shawn Colvin_, and receiving a surprise

timate, experimental style of
Rose's home recordings and
writings, which often bend

ality, as on "Olga_'s Birthday"
and "Parhelion."
Joining Rose is Erin
McKeown, a Gettysburg fa
vorite. Beginning her career
as a Semi-Finalist: Modern
Rock/Alternative Category in
the 1995 Songwriter's Asso
ciation of Washington DCs
Mid-Atlantic Song Contest,
McKeown has steadily
evolved into a dynamic per
former, an accomplished gui
tarist, and an innovative
songstress.

Using the framework of
her own start-up label, TVP Records of
Providence, and distribution affiliations
with Waterbug Records (Chicago, IL)
and Ladyslipper Music (Durham, NC)

with a degree in Ethnomusicology.
What does Erin McKeown sound
like? Songwriters describe her distinct
sound: "like a wily Zen master" (Rose
Polenzani), "the very first Erin
McKeown" (Dar Williams), "distilling
existing forms into new vocabulary... get
up and dance" (Andrew Calhoun).
Ed McKeon of WWUH-FM says
"Judging by her lyrics, Erin McKeown
is wise beyond her years. She plumbs
the depths of personal relationships,
revealing the agony and joy through

Egypt not a princely movie

by Barb Dickson
Editor-in-Chief
I had heard only good
things about The Prince of
Egypt. The soundtrack sold
incredibly well, so I thought
there would be some good
songs. And who can argue with
the story? It's a great one. So
when 1 rented it from Block
buster the other night, I fully
expected to enjoy a really good
movie. Boy was I wrong.
The movie tells the story
of Moses (voice of Val Kilmer)
and the exodus from Egypt

with an emphasis on the rela
tionship between Moses and
his adopted brother Rameses
(voice of Ralph Fiennes).
As a baby, Moses, the son
of a slave (and noticeably with
out a father), is set adrift in the
river by his mother. He is res
cued by the Queen of Egypt
and is raised as the Prince df
Egypt, growing up with
Rameses, who is to be the next
Pharaoh. The two get into
many fun mishaps, but soon
Moses learns the truth of his
heritage (thanks to his sister,
voiced by Sandra Bullock).
He now notices the plight
of the Hebrew slaves and, af¬

ter accidentally killing a man,
teels the need to inn into the
desert. After finding a happy
group of people living in an
oasis, God speaks to Moses,
instructing him to lead the He
brew people out of Egypt.
The movie has everything
an animated feature these days
requires: a bunch of songs, a lot
of introspection on the hero's
part, and of course there's a
love story. The problem is,
none of these components are
good enough to make a com
pelling movie.
First ot all, the songs did
nothing for me. The back
ground voices were really good
on most of the songs, but the
melodies were less than impres
sive. They try to _sounxl as if
they belong in a Broadway

show, but never make it. Pei
liaps Stephen Schwaitz (who
wrote the songs) thought that
this would be the next Lion
King. 1 hope he's not holding
his breath. Theie's a song that
consists almost entirely of
people chanting "You're play
ing with the big boys now." I
shudder.
The character that im
pressed me most in the movie
was Rameses. Fiennes does a
wonderful job with his voice,
and who can resist that accent?
Though Moses is the protago
nist of the movie, Rameses is
the guy I liked. I felt bad for
him. He had a lot to deal with
and out of nowhere his brother
comes up to him saying "Let
my people go"? I would freak
too.

Rameses provides one of
the better patts of the movie.
In the midst of the plagues,
Moses walks up to him.
Rameses notices him and says,
"So, let me guess: You're gonna
say "Let my people go.'" Sar
casm plus a British accent; who
could ask for more?
The love story could not
have been of less importance.
It's as if at some point the pro
ducers read the script, pointed
out that there was nobody for
Moses to fall in love with, and
forced the writers to add some
one. "Hey!" they thought.
"We could get a big name star
to give her the voice, like
Michelle Pfeiffer! That would
be good!" And of course her
character had to have been a
slave at one point too. So she

and Moses have something in
common. Isn't that great?
Kilmer does an adequate
;ob with Moses, though at no
point did I feel enough passion
to have followed him into the
desert. As Aaron, Jeff
Goldblum was sorely
underused (particularly for a
character so vital to the story
in Exodus). Steve Martin and
Martin Short also lent their
voices to the film, though are
barely noticeable.
And don't even get me
started on the the way the
Egyptian religion is treated
with complete contempt.

Case You Missed It." And in

The pagan presence

say, but what exactly is pagan
ism anyway? Don't you dress
up in robes and light candles
and sacrifice young children to
Satan or something?
Not quite! Robes and
candles—sometimes; sacrific
ing children—no! Let's just
make this clear: Paganism has
nothing to do with Satanism.
First of all, Satan is a Judeo
Christian concept; pagans
don't accept the concept of evil
personified. Therefore, we
obviously cannot worship or
obey any Supreme Evil Being.
Second, pagans abhor manipu
lative and exploitive acts, such
as are often attributed to
Satanists. Finally, pagans do
not seek power through the
suffering of others. We oper
ate on the other end of the
spectrum, seeking to become
aware of ourselves as all part
of a larger cycle, to heal the
earth and her children, and
enhance the wellbeing of all life
in general.
Paganism is as much an

by The Gettysburg
College Pagans
So what was the deal with
the big pentacle hanging on
PJank the other week? As some
of you know, Saturday the 18th
was Pagan Pride Day. The sheet
sign was created by Gettysburg
College's own pagans, as both
a celebration of our beliefs and
an announcement that pagan
ism is active on campus, though
very few people may know
about it. Why announce it at
all? Because each of us started
out alone, dissatisfied with in
stitutional religions, yet still
seeking a meaningful spiritual
path. By word of mouth, some
of us got together last year for

the first time, and while we still
practice individually, it is also
great to be able to get together
with otheis who share our
views. We discuss beliefs, dif
ferent traditions (for paganism
encompasses everything from
shamanism to wicca to druid
lsm, to name a few), upcoming
events in the pagan community,
and sometimes plan for an up
coming holding, such as a sol
stice or equinox. It's a reflec
tion of the pagan community
that we have no leader, all de
cisions are done by consensus,
and no one is bound by any
mle beyond "if it harms none,
do as ye will."
All well and good, you

r

ethics system as a religion. It
is characterized by a deep re
spect for all living things, ac
ceptance of personal and social
responsibility, attunement to
natural rhythms, healing,
achieving balance between all
aspects of the self and society,
a sense of play and wonder, and
the celebration of sensuality. It
is a positive, life-affirming spiri
tuality. Basically, it teaches that
you should enjoy life, and re
member to help everyone else
enjoy it as well.
A few facts': The five
points of the pentacle represent
earth, air, fire, water, and spirit.
Most pagans believe in multiple
gods, or one supreme power
and a multitude of less power
ful spirits. Paganism reveres
the Goddess as well as the God.
Some traditions worship the
Goddess exclusively, while oth
ers focus more on the God, but
most revere male and female
equally. This recognition of a
female deity has given pagan
ism a large feminist following.

Most pagans also have a strong
ecological focus, since we re
vere the earth as the source of
all life. That is why most of
our major holidays correspond
with agricultural seasons:
planting, harvesting, etc. Pa
gans respect all life; thus many
are vegetarians—but certainly
not all!
As you can see, paganism
is a diverse religion, covering a
wide range of belief systems,
and appealing to a variety of
people. It is also an ethics sys
tem based on love, respect, and
the pursuit of knowledge.
Know that we mean no harm,
and that we are not out to con
vert you. All we ask for is tol
erance, understanding, and the
freedom to practice as we
choo.se. We welcome sincere
questions—just email us at

• Dear Libby,

How about making
more than one copy of the
"Destinos" video series for
reserve? I always have to
wait three hours because
someone has already checked
the episode I need out. This
is a frequent problem.
Sincerely, Mike C.
Dear Mike (and the other

two anonymous authors with
the same question),
Libby wonders why you
and your fellow "Destinos"
devotees don't watch the ever
popular (and required) Spanish
soap opera on cable. You see,
we bought the cable rights for
"Destinos" and we show each
episode on Channel 4 three
times a day, for four days, for
Spanish 101 and 103. If you
are in Spanish 104 with fewer
students, we show "Destinos"
two times a day for up to four
days (see schedule in box).
You do the math, Mike.
That's twelve showings. Can
you and your anonymous
friends really not make it to any
of these showings?
The reason we have one
set of "Destinos" on reserve is
for students who absolutely
can't watch Channel 4 at any of
the times.

Now Mike, if you and
your anonymous brothers live
in certain off campus residences
you may have a legitimate com
plaint. There is no campus
cable in the Majestic Apart
ments, College Apartments,
Brownstones, Colonial Motel,
Criterion Motel, Criterion
Apartments, Appleford Inn, the
Tudor House, or the Seminary.
But did you know you can
watch Channel 4 in rooms 003,
004, 401, 402, and 403 in the
library? The Spanish depart¬

ment also has a set of
"Destinos" videos for viewing
in McKnight.
Here's the deal. We
WANT you to watch
"Destinos" on cable. Even if we
bought another copy for the
reserve desk it wouldn't satisfy
the 250 plus Spanish students
with this assignment. And vid
eos are good for about 100
plays and then into the trash can
it goes. We'd be replacing a
$699 set of videos every year.
Not too smart. That's why we
bought the broadcast rights.
Maybe our broadcast
times are no good. Would you

and your friends like to suggest
other times we could show
"Destinos"? We're open to
suggestions. Let Nancy
Johnson in the Media Services
office know. Her email is
njohnson and her phone num
ber is x7022.
Do you have a sugges
tion? Send it to my campus
email lmussel. If you're tech
nologically impaired and pre
fer the old fashioned method,
write it on a piece of paper and
put it in the suggestion box on
the Circulation Desk.

Letters to the Editor

Welcome to reality
Last week's Consider This was way
off base. Actually, the whole
front page was a bit ridiculous.
It is getting really annoying to hear ev
eryone just complain about how every
one else has harmed them. When will
people on this campus starting taking
responsibility for their actions?
The attack on "townies" was un
necessary. 1 do not care how much
money we pay to go here or how much
money we contribute to the town. That
is exactly why so many of them refuse
to accept us: because we always throw
that fact in their face. We live here for
four years; they have lived here for a
lifetime, so please respect their prop
erty, their sleep, and their privacy.
The attack on Safety 5c Security
was also unnecessary. Of course, it is a
shame that there has been campus
crime. Hello. This is the real world.
These things are going to happen. Ev
eryone knows not to walk alone or to
carry large amounts of cash. Safety &C

A shot in the dark
After reading Rick Deutsch's Sep
tember 23 column entitled
"Think Hunting is a Sport? Ask
the Deer," I found myself annoyed. I
was annoyed that, after reading Kate
Welton's letter to the editor in which
she urges students to avoid stereotypes,
Mr. Deutsch was neck deep in a stereo
type that he knows nothing about. He
seems to believe that all hunters are
reckless, immature people who shoot at
anything that moves. On the contrary,
all hunters that I know obey the rules,
and are overly careful about what
they're doing.
Now, I do not claim to be a hunter.
On the contrary, I hunted once, got
nothing, and hated it. 1 do, however,

Security can only try to prevent crimes
they cannot be personal security guards
for 2400 people.
Also, they are really working hard
to curb the parties and drinking on cam
pus for a good reason; a lot of the prob
lems start there. All you need to do is
stop and think about it. That does not
mean that there should not be parties,
but if that is where the trouble stems
from, they are going to work their hard
est in that area.
As far as building access that ap
pears to be something you need to talk
to the faculty about; they need to keep
those lists and hours up to date.
The bottom line is that you need
to accept responsibility and direct your
criticism in the right directions instead
of blaming Safety 8c Security for your
problems. There is a Safety & Security
Liaison Committee for Student Senate:
come to the meetings on Monday nights
at 7:00p.m. and voice your legitimate

concerns.
Sincerely,
Christine Sedlacko '00
know a bit about what he seems to claim
to be a stupid belief of the hunters. I
am referring to the population control
side of hunting.
At the beginning of the century,
the white-tailed deer was nearly hunted
to extinction. As a result of laws and
regulations, the deer have been pro
tected so well that, in light of their dis
appearing habitat, their density in many
areas is greater than the carrying capac
ity of that land.
Mr. Deutsch refers to natural se
lection and how, if there isn't enough
food, the weak deer will die off natu
rally, leaving the stronger deer. There
are two major flaws with this though,
showing that Mr. Deutsch has little ex
- continued on page 14 -
see DEER

Consider This

In the past few years, more and more classes have moved from 50
minute time slots to 75-minute slots. This has also reduced the number
of classes per week from three to two. For most students, classes only
twice per week means a light day on Friday, usually accompanied by an
earlier start on weekend drinking.
Some members of the campus do not prefer this system. It means
lectures that carry on well past they point at which they stop being inter
esting and informative. Most students simply cannot sit still for 75 min-

to fill 75-minutes of class time, but they also
have to deal with a bunch of students whose attention spans ran out after
ten minutes.
Shorter classes means less congested days, although it would prob
ably eliminate the three day weekend many students have now. Overall,
the quality of classroom instruction would improve, as both professors
and students could focus more on smaller pieces of material each day.

utes, much less take good notes or respond
thoughtfully to questions.
Further, most lessons seem about an hour
long. Teachers often complete one topic and
begin the next, only to stop in the middle of a
thought as the class period ends. Fifty minutes
is a convenient time for both student attention
spans and the average lesson length.
At the very least, classes that meet on Mon
day and Wednesday should be shortened and
also held on Friday. This means less work each
night and allows faculty-student interaction to
occur more frequently.
Obviously, classes meeting on Tuesday and
Thursday must be 75-minutes, but these days
should be less cluttered than the other week
days to allow adequate time for sports, home
work and other campus activities.
Also, early morning classes should be a rar
ity. Classes at eight and even nine in the morn
ing are just not practical for many students.
Homework does not even start for many on this
campus until 10 or 11 at night, after all activi
ties are done. Sleep usually follows at two or
three in the morning. It simply is not reason
able to expect students to be awake and astute
on four or five hours of sleep.

Longer classes are bad for professors as
well. Not only do they have to figure out how

Letters to the Editor, continued

Safety & Security
or Secret Police?
The past two Friday
nights two of my
friends have been beat
up in front of Lamp Post. On
the first occasion the two were
together, the next week one of
them was beat up again. How
can this happen? Is Safety &
Security's investigation any
closer to the truth? The answer

is no. The reason I know is two
of my other friends and I were
stopped on the first Friday
night as we went to see if the
two victims were all right. We
weren't drunk, we were just
walking down the street, but
we were stopped and ques
tioned by Safety and Security.
They weren't polite in the least
they questioned us like crimi
nals. The following week I was
called in at 12 a.m. and inter
rogated until 1 a.m. even
though I had a test in the morn
ing, which I failed.

Safety 6c Security
defends its
position I want to commend you and
your staff for the article
"Attack at Lamp Post" in
the September 23 edition of
The Gettysburgian. The article
was well written and factually
represented the assault of our
student. Articles like this in
form an educate our students,
faculty, and staff of incidents on
campus. These articles not
only raise awareness, but also
can provide valuable informa
tion for readers to protect
themselves.
I would also like to take
this opportunity to comment
on parts of the article and the
editorial about the role of
Safety 8c Security on campus.
As the Director of Campus
Safety, I am concerned that our

It turns out that my two
friends and I are their three pri
mary suspects, suspects in the
beating of our own friends.
After one of the victims was
called in to clear our names,
Safety &C Security questioned
him, then told him he was too
drunk at the time to have any
idea who did it. They claimed
an eyewitness saw us beat them
up, however they couldn't pro
vide us with their name. I told
them to call other students who
could testify that I was with
them during the fight, however,
they did not care.
The following week one
of the victims was beaten again,
this time his wallet was stolen,
and Safety & Security was too
late to the scene once again.
This time they handled the situ
ation by fining the student for
underage consumption, as if it
was his fault he was mugged.

I then had a follow up
meeting with a Dean about the
incident on the first Friday
night. This time I learned that
anonymous student feels that
safety and security at Gettys
burg is the sole responsibility
of Safety & Security. Safety &c
Security plays a major role, but
a safe campus is everyone's re
sponsibility. Having campus
community members report
suspicious activities, lock their
doors, avoid leaving valuable
items in their cars, and avoid
walking alone at night in dark
areas are but a few examples of
how students can reduce their
vulnerability to crime.
Since the academic year
began, Safety &c Security and
the Borough police have con
ducted joint foot patrols along
the major corridors used by stu
dents. These patrols are con
ducted to make the presence of
Security and police visible and
to make our streets safer for ev¬

eryone.
Having citizens, the po
lice and college security work

the eyewitness did not see the
beating at all, but saw my two
friends and I walking around
that night by Lamp Post and
thought we might be possible
suspects. We have to walk by
there to get to another friend's
house who lives on Lincoln.
What amazes me about
these two situations and other
incidents that have occurred
this year, is Safety &c Security's
devotion to getting the stu
dents in trouble and throwing
the blame on us, the very

people who they are supposed
to be protecting. I'm also
amazed at how Safety and
Security's unprofessional atti
tude can go unchecked.
In the paper, the suspects
in the recent mugging were
described as white males. But
the victims of both incidents
said the assailants were His
panic, and 'that there were
more than two of them. Per
haps Safety &C Security should
be searching for these people
and not the victim's friends

ing together has proven suc
cessful in many communities.
College Security has joined the
police in crime prevention with
community patrols. It is citi
zens working together that pre
vents crimes. Gettysburg Col
lege is not a sanctuary. Crimes
can and do occur. We can re
duce crimes with vigilance and
cooperation.
The assault at Lamp Post
was observed by a student who
telephoned Security. The offic
¦ers were able to respond
quickly and aid the victim. A
break-in of student vehicles was
recently prevented when one of
our student patrol officers no
ticed suspicious activity and
called Security on his radio.
The responding officers iden
tified at least one person with
a known criminal background
and found some cars that had
been tampered with.
The editorial on security

and other students. But they
have a problem; they are cam
pus security and I'm guessing
they can't take their investiga
tion beyond campus to the
town, so the only power they
have is to harass the students.
I have some suggestions.
Instead of going out of their
way to crack down on frater
nities and student drinking,
perhaps they should look to
Washington and Lee for some
advice. I was accepted there, as
well as at Gettysburg. My

friend goes there. I have vis
ited the school several times.
They don't necessarily condone
underage drinking, but they
don't go out of their way to get
students in trouble.
Why would they? These
are there students, they give
them the benefit of the doubt.
Fraternity parties are safe and
under control. If you think
about it, cracking down on
campus only forces students to
try to drink at bars and to flock
to off-campus parties; they're

patrol and building access also
elicit my comment. With
today's environment of binge
drinking on campus, officers
are going to take action when
they see or hear of a party with
alcohol or see an alcohol vio
lation. We are not trying to
replace Party Patrol. I believe
with the increased foot patrol
by Security and the Borough
police, we have become more
visible and present when these
"alcohol violations" are occur
ring. I agree that student access
to buildings is important. The
existence of an after-hours ac
cess policy does not mean that
security will open locked build
ings, but allows students to re
main in buildings after closing.
Since most of the academic
buildings are open until
11:00p.m., student access is
generally accommodated.
If officers have to keep

forcing us into the town.
As this happens, it is only
inevitable that there are prob
lems between students and citi
zens of the town. And Safety
&C Security can only deal with
the students. If they did a bet
ter job of encouraging on-cam
pus events, any problems be
tween students could be fully
handled by the campus.
I turned down Washing
ton and Lee, a school that is
consistently ranked in the top
ten liberal arts schools in the
nation. I turned them down
because I thought I loved Get
tysburg a lot more. I'm on
scholarship here, I love the pro
fessors and the students, I do
well, and if I want to, and when
my work is done, I'll find a way
to party. However, student mo
rale has become low due to
Safety & Security's constant
harassment. Perhaps I made an
error in my choice of schools.
It's not to late to transfer.
Sincerely,
Erie Gibson '02

returning to buildings they
have already locked to let stu
dents in, they are not available
for other security activities.
This is why we have an after
hours access list; it enables stu
dents to be in buildings after
closing and allows Security to
know who is in specific build
ings in the event we have a
safety concern or need to
evacuate the buildings.
I welcome students to
stop by or call the Safety &
Security office at any time to
discuss this type of issue with
me. Through discussion and
understanding we will make
Gettysburg a safer place to
learn and grow.
Thank you for the oppor
tunity to comment on the re
cent articles about Safety 8c
Security at Gettysburg.
Sincerely,
David T. Yohman
Director, Safety & Security

Sunrises are nice, but sleep
is better

by jeph mcgowan
First Year Columnist
What makes a good day?
Breakfast potatoes, did you
say? It depends. If you're some
crazy wacko (and I just happen
to be), they probably do. Who
ever said that breakfast is the
most important meal of the day
probably had my eight-thirty
class and wished, through ev
ery single second of it, they'd
eaten something. Just waking
up five minutes before class
doesn't cut it.
After wallowing in my
own self- _^^
hunger _^^P _d_^_k
through that _^^_J _^ _^^_K j
inferna ^^^^^_R_^^^^
class, break-_^^^^^^^^^
fast is aB_^_B_^_BH_^BiH
warm (and tasty) treat. Hon
estly, that class is like downing
a bottle of Nyquil.
I used to have a regular
sleeping pattern. For the last
month, for whatever reason,
my time spent in the sack has
diminished greatly. Granted, I
make up most of it during my
eight thirty class, but I still
don't get to bed until near
dawn some mornings. Sunrises
are nice, but sleep is better. I
noticed the differences between
college and high school today.
The biggest difference: in col
lege I actually have to come out
of the overnight coma I fall

into. It's a lot to ask of a lowly
freshman, but I think that
maybe, after I get into the
swing of things, I'll wake up be
fore three in the afternoon.
The week's been all fun and
games, but it could be better. I
think someone needs to mow
the lawn. Either that, or I need
a healthy dose of chicken rice
soup. On the way home last
night, I got to thinking about
one day when I was waiting in
traffic on the turnpike. I
watched all the people in other
lane and thought about all the
nameless faces passing me by

MK I'm just one in a load, like six
billion. I know many people,
but the total is so minuscule
compared with the sum total
on this marble of ours.
Just think about all the
people I'll never meet, all the
faces that exist as "filler" in the
daily grind of my life. They say
that the random images get
fixed up into a little story and
that's what's in your dream. I
wonder, am I living on inside
someone else's dreamscape?
Thousands of millions of
people with their own lives,
their own individuality and ex
istence filled with similar (and
not-so
^^ _^_k _^_fe. similar)
_XVltnals
_^^^^^_fea a n d
_^^^^^^^^^^^^_H t r 1 b u 1 a -
_M_^HH_^HBt ions.
The two friends walking by
themselves talking on the next
floor down at the mall have no
idea that I exist, nor will they
ever. I know nothing about
them, and my life and my ex
perience they'll never know.
Realize: this life is an is
land in a sea of islands, a star
in the vast bounds of the uni
verse. You hold close to yours,
but wonder at the same time
about every other one you can
see. It is your star, and only
your star. Think how meaning
ful it is to you, but how com
pletely meaningless it is to some
guy sitting in his kitchen in

Vancouver.
The monumental number
of people in the world, you'd
think that we'd feel closer, but
in this day and age, sometimes
it's quite the opposite. Despair
not, my faithful friends, this
young buck has more. Even
though it seems your problems
are a breeze through the grass
in the next valley over, there's
someone around that cares and
will hear every bit of that prob
lem down to its solution.
That's the beauty of life. You
think you're alone, and then
someone appears with a smile,
and the sun comes out over
your once cloudy day.

WOMEN STILL HAYfe FAR TO 60

by Rachel Hanson
Columnist
Last-Saturday I watched
as a number of girls on my floor
got ready to go to their
sorority's mixer later that
night. To my great shock, when
I asked what the theme of this
mixer was, one girl replied,
"Whores and Pimps."
As I sat talking to one of
my own sorority sisters later
on, she told me about a rush t
shirt for a certain fraternity that
she had spotted in _Servo ear
lier that day. Without divulg
ing into too many repulsive de¬

tails, it will suffice to say that
this particular depiction of
women was highly degrading
and terribly offensive.
So many people on this
campus (and in the world) be
lieve that the women's move
ment has fixed everything that
is wrong and that women's
lives and experiences are ex
actly what they should be.
These two archaic displays of
sexism and female degradation
by members of both sexes in
our own student body prove
that this is very, very far from
reality.
Women have made a
great number of strides over

the past decades and I will not
argue with how monumental
these have been. We have a
woman as both our Secretary
of State and Attorney General.
It is even rumored that a
woman (New Jersey Governor
Christine Todd Whitman) may

get the Republican nomination
for Vice President in the up
coming election. Women at
tend Ivy League schools in high
numbers and are greatly im
proving their status in the
workplace. Women were even
given the long-awaited "gift" of
freedom of choice in pregnancy
a little over 25 years ago.
However, women still
face an incredible amount of
discrimination and sexist ideas
that are very discouraging to
the position of women in our
society. Women still only make
75 percent of what men make
in the same professions. A sur¬

vey done two years ago showed
that a woman with four years
of college education actually
made LESS than a man with
only a high school diploma.
Women are expected to take on
the "double day," working at
least an eight-hour day outside
the home and then also fulfill
ing the "traditional" role in the
home as wife and mother.
Wo ' men have also
watched their rights to a safe
and legal abortion be slowly
stripped away. Just a little over
ten years ago, 17-year-old
Becky Bell died from a botched
abortion that she was forced to
obtain illegally because of
Indiana's parental consent
laws. Laws like these contrib
ute to the present government
supported oppression of

women.
Finally, there are the daily
instances of sexual oppression
that I was unlucky enough to
witness at my own beloved
Gettysburg over the past week
end. Until men as a whole treat
women with the respect they
deserve as fellow human beings
and until women stop allowing
themselves to be degraded on
a regular basis and even per
petuate these beliefs them
selves, women will continue to
be oppressed.

Maybe Mom's Right: You Should Sleep More, Drink
Less

hoi poisoning or alcohol-re
lated deaths.
"Well, I don't drink," you
say. No matter. College stu
dents everywhere depend on
that morning cappuccino to
make it to class or that 20
ounce soda to survive all-night
cram sessions. A University of
Washington study determined
that those who avoided caffeine
had significant increases in
brain energy, and those who
developed a tolerance for it suf
fered headaches and a lack of
energy when they went with
out the product for a few days.
Hmmm. And that brings
us to those pick-me-ups some
of us get from those puffs of
nicotine. Forget bad breath and
smelly clothes and hair. Do the
words "lung cancer" or "em
physema" mean anything to
you?

As I sat at the table, the
slice of pizza stared at me,
taunting my already full stom
ach. My friends sat across the
table, taunting my pride. One
slice, they said. I could do it.
Twelve slices later, I was
resigned to being champion of
the all-you-can-eat pizza con
test. I also was resigned to the
fact that I was going to throw
up any minute.
The abuse college stu
dents put their bodies through
boggles my mind more than a

quantum physics test. We never
sleep, we always eat, and the
weight of the books in our
backpacks is heavy enough to
knock us down if the wind
picks up a little. We sit for
hours on end in classes, stretch
ing our brain cells to the limit.
We then drink ourselves into a
stupor, destroying the already
worn out little buggers.
We laugh, but such be
havior isn't always funny.
More than one-third of
college students admit to binge
drinking — having four or
more alcoholic beverages per
sitting for women, five or more
drinks for men. Besides the
strain on the wallet that this can
lead to, it's a strain on one's
health, not to mention one's
life. Between 25 and 50 stu
dents die each year from alco-

Why do we do this to
ourselves? We are young and
healthy now, but we won't be
for long if we keep up this be
havior. Will the thousands
(upon thousands) of dollars we
spend to obtain an education
be worth anything if the nasty
little habits we develop at
school put us in the grave?
Yes, college is a stressful
time of life. Homework and
tests take on a whole new
meaning from anything ever
experienced in high school. But
it's also a wonderful feeling of
freedom and independence. It's

the first time a young adult is
really out on his or her own.
Mom's not there every minute
to tell us to eat our vegetables,
or to go to bed or to not sit so
close to the television.
Maybe that's the prob
lem. Although we are "respon
sible" adults, perhaps we
should continue taking advice
from our parents. They've been
there, they've done it, and al
though they still haven't fig
ured out how to program the
VCR, they do know what
they're talking about.
"Take care of yourself,"

my mom says. "Cut back on I'm sure you've heard
alcohol, avoid the fatty foods, that lecture, too.
just say no to drugs, exercise, Now it's time to listen —
get some sleep, brush your before we all age another 20
teeth ..." years.

Deer

perience in the ecology/envi
ronmental field.
First, he fails to realize
that if the deer population is
not controlled, not only would
the deer suffer from malnutri
tion, but disease would run
though the population, killing
more than would starvation.
Secondly, he fails to realize that
it is humans who killed off all
of the natural predators of the
deer, one example being the
wolf. We are now the only
predator of the deer, whether
we do it with a gun or by run
ning it off a cliff like the Plains
Indians and the buffalo.
I have no disrespect for
the stand of extreme environ
mentalists on this issue, but
they must also be aware of all
of the facts. Control of the
deer population is a necessity.
If it is not done, the hungry,
diseased deer will be roaming
into our yards and eating what
ever they can find ... it has hap
pened. Look at another ex
ample: we set traps for mice

that get in our house, why?
Because they are dirty, carry
disease, and damage property.
What about deer? They're
dirty, carry disease, damage
property, and are cute! This
fourth thing is why people like
Mr. Deutsch are opposed to
hunting.
The last comment 1
would like to make is in re
sponse to Mr. Deutsch's com
ment that "there is, in the eyes
of the humane and reasonable,
nothing right about hunting."
Let me ask him this: what is
humane about letting a deer
starve to death? In our soci
ety, it is wrong to neglect a per
son or people. Why are deer
any different in that respect?
Until the day comes that hu
mans no longer live on this
planet (probably never), over
population is not a solution to
the problem that we caused by
eliminating the natural preda
iors of the deer.

Levelling an era

by Bill Davidson
Sports Editor
On Monday, the Detroit
Tigers played their final game
in Major League Baseball's old
est stadium. Tiger Stadium,
which has housed Detroit's
baseball team since 1912, will
be torn down before the open
ing of the 2000 baseball season.
Instead of playing in the
dilapidated, pre-WWI building
on Trumbull Avenue, the Tigers
will be moving across town to
Comerica Park, a state-of-the
art facility, which promises to
generate more revenue and a
more comfortable environment
for fans.
Baseball nostalgics cringe
at the thought of seeing Ty
Cobb's old stomping grounds
leveled with dynamite. How
ever, no stadium needs to be
flattened more than Tiger Sta
dium.

Thick poles and chain
link fences obstruct fans' view
of the action. Because the
lower deck is not elevated, on
deck hitters, first base coaches,
and bullpen pitchers impede
views of the opposite side of
the field. Bathrooms are small
and amenities few.
An upper deck overhang
in the outfield distracts oppos
ing right fielders and all play¬

ers complain of cramped locker
room space and occasionally
cold shower water.
So when April rolls

around, Tiger fans and
players alike will wel
come the new, upscale
ballpark.
The Tigers are
following a trend in
professional sports,
which has escalated in
the 1990's. Currently,
over 75% of profes
sional sports teams have
recently built, or are en
tertaining plans to
build, a new stadium.
These stadiums promise
more comfortable seat
ing, enticing amenities,
and luxury boxes.
Fans have re
sponded accordingly,
flooding the gates of
these new stadiums and
spending millions of

dollars in the process.
With increase atten
dance, baseball popu
larity is at an all-time
high.

For years, the right field upper deck
overhang at Tiger Stadiium distracted
opposing right fielders.

However, for the true
baseball fan, leaving venues
such as Tiger Stadium marks
another step forward in a
painstaking march away from
the game they love.
The "comfort" of new
stadiums has pushed fans fur¬

ther from the field. In older
parks such as Tiger Stadium,
Wrigley Field, and Fenway
Park, fans are close to the ac¬

tion. Fans at Tiger Stadium and
Wrigley Field can (and do) con
verse with players in the
bullpen. This is the antithesis
of Camden Yards in Baltimore
(erected in 1992), where the
bullpens are separated from
spectators by a safe distance

and high fence.
The intimate proximity
of older stadiums brings fans
significantly closer to the field

than a comparable seat
in a new venue. But in
timacy between fans
and players is unfortu
nately not the biggest
loss endured when
teams hop, from their
old to new homes.
The real tragedy
of the new stadium
trend is that the com
mon, middle class fans
have been pushed out
out of the ballparks.
Just ten years
ago, upper deck, box
seats could be bought
for under five dollars.
At Camden Yards in
Baltimore, the most
expensive seat is $35
and the cheapest seat
in the upper deck, bar
ring home run terri
tory, goes for $13.

Camden Yards is
not alone. Reasonable
seats at Arizona's Bank
One Ballpark range from 13 to
50 dollars. And, each year the
owners of these teams raise
ticket prices.
In the owner's defense,
they need to generate enough
revenue to pay wealthy ath
letes. So in this domino effect_.

going to the ballpark has be
come more like attending a
polo match.
It's 1999 and going to
baseball games has become
fashionable. Wealthy people
are watching wealthy players.
Consequently, these white-col
lar affairs have kept the true
fans away. Instead of thunder
ous roars, good play receives
polite applause from mild man
nered crowds.
Resisting change and
progress is futile. Baseball sta
diums age and new ones must
replace them. But as people
flock to new stadiums to enjoy
a "night out," the true baseball
fan feels no urgency to visit
these venues.
Instead, the fan will
shuffle off to a less commercial
ized stadium, whose owner
undoubtedly has blue prints to
replace it.

At the ticket gate, they'll
buy a box seat for less than it
would cost to sit in the nose
bleed section at Jacob's Field in
Cleveland. Once inside, they'll
cheer wildly (with the rest of
the crowd) for good play, boo
poor play, and yell at umpires
when they blow a call.
And, if they think of it,
they'll reflect on games they
went to as a kid and feel sad
dened that the real fun of go
ing to the ballpark will soon be
impossible.

sively, the Mules played a very
physical brand of soccer. Our
Bullets had no trouble keep
ing up, but the tally of fouls
raised to 48. The Mules
seemed to foul often upon
losing possession.
Senior captain Chris
Pryor, Vishio, and sophomore
Michael McLaughlin pre
sented the Bullets with their
best chances for scoring, but
could not put it away.
The balls which made it
through the screen of the
Muhlenburg defense were
stopped by the talented

Mules' goalie.
The Bullet defense had
little difficulty as their oppo
nents rarely pushed players for
ward. However, they quickly
handled the few breakaways
that made it past the midfield.
In the Mules' closest scor
ing opportunity, keeper Nick
La Porta got enough of a hand
on the ball to tip it off the cross
bar. The two overtime halves
presented more time for scor
ing opportunities. Yet, unfor
tunately, none of these yielded
goals. Muhlenburg did not have

any better luck, though, re
sulting in the tie. The play
ers were visibly fatigued at the
end of the drawn out contest.
This game brought the
Bullets' record to 5-1-2 over
all and 1-0-1 in the confer
ence. Flynn said, "It doesn't
hurt us, because we are still
undefeated in the confer
ence." Each conference game
is important, with an NCAA
bid at stake. The Bullets are
still in good position, and are
currently ranked 25th in Di
vision III.

Bryan Pojanowski and David

Garnet Tide quarter
back Scott Murray completed
nine of 15 passes for 77 yards

"It was our best perfor

Boyd. "It's something to build

The next game will be

to avenge a 52-35 loss from
last season.
The Gettysburg defen

"Defensively," said Moore,

Cross Country teams suffer disappointing losses
Men split, women swept in Little 3 meet

by Jeff Cumpson
Staff Writer
Amid dreary conditions
and frenzied fan support
(surely the first sightings of face
paint in recent history), the
Gettysburg College men's and
women's cross country teams
hosted the second of their four
home meets this year as local
rivals Dickinson College and
Franklin & Marshall College
convened in Gettysburg for the
most recent installment of the

Little Three Meet.
In a very competitive
race, the men finished second,
defeating Franklin & Marshall
25-35 while falling to
Dickinson 20-35.
The women did not fare
as well, as both Dickinson (19
40) and Franklin &C Marshall
(25-30) beat the Bullets, with
Dickinson taking the team title.
The men were led by se
nior Brian Holden, whose time
of 21:25.70 was good enough
for 6th place.

Juniors Jason Rose and
Jonathon Catlett (21:32.91
and 21:42.01, respectively)
came in at 8th and 9th place

for the Bullets, while sopho
more Evan Merkhofer
(21:44.29) and senior David
Gary (21:53.59) rounded out
the top five for the men.
"I thought the team ran
hard, but its always difficult
when you lose on your home
course, with all your friends
there watching. It hurts hav
ing to congratulate the teams
that beat you, but it gives you
the motivation to beat them
next time," said senior captain
Gary. Sophomores Kristin Rob
erts (19:51.46), Megan
McGolrick (20:40.39), and
Lauren Davis (20:56.41) took
the top three spots for the
women, finishing 2nd, 9th, and
13th overall, respectively.
Junior Kim Heimerl was
right behind Davis taking 14th
with a time of 20:57.46.
Freshman Melissa
Holman completed the top five
for Gettysburg, finishing in
19th place with a time of

21:13.67.
Considering both the
cool conditions and the inten
sity of the rivalry, the overall
mood was disappointment.
Both teams have performed

better this year, and this meet
was the type that usually brings
out the best in a competitive
athelete.
"We see those guys all
year and get to know them
pretty well," Catlett said of the
Dickinson and F & M teams.
'You may like one of their guys,
but once he puts on that uni
form that says Dickinson or F
&C M, it doesn't really matter.
Each team wants to prove that
they are the best program in the
area." Heimerl concurred. "I
know all the girls were pretty
excited about this meet, and it's
always that way. We want to
beat those two teams, whether
it's at the Little Three, Confer
ences, or whatever," she said.
Speaking of both the
men's and women's races,
Head Coach Robert Condon
said, "It was a very hard fought
battle; one of the toughest
meets of the year."

Gettysburg will try and
regroup for a tough meet this
weekend, as they travel to Fort
Frederick State Park in Mary
land for the Frostburg State
Invitational. Many regional
rivals will be present, and it will
provide a firm test.

But in what proved to be

In the play that followed

-continued from page22-

the timeout, the Eagles blocked
a hit from the Bullets. The
block sent the ball to the floor
in bounds on Gettysburg's side
of the court to end the match.
Offense was a large part
of Tuesday's match, and Kelly
believes that the offensive abili
ties of both teams were even.
Senior Catherine Schott
racked up 10 kills in the match,
and Wargo contributed 11 kills
as well as five digs. Guay led
the defense with five digs.
For Juniata, their defense
is what made them strong in the
match.
Kelly stated, "They don't
let themselves get down. If we
get stuck at a certain point we
need to pick it up."

Bullets battle Mules to draw
Men's soccer 1-0-1 after key conference matchup

by Robin Roger
Staff Writer
Tensions ran high
as the Bullets recorded
their fourth shutout, a 0
0 tie with Muhlenberg on
Saturday.
The Mules pre
sented some of
Gettysburg's toughest
competition. However,
they should not be con¬

sidered the Bullets'
equals. With only 17
shots taken overall, the
Bullet's had the most
scoring opportunities, but
just could not fit through
the Mules' packed de
fense. Muhlenburg played
a very defensive style of
soccer, generating few
scoring opportunities for
themselves, while denying
the Bullets.
Senior captain Jason
Vishio said, "It was frus
trating because we should
have scored six goals in
the first ten minutes."
He believed the Bul
lets were at their best,
even though they did not
come away with the win.
Vishio attributed
their difficulty in scoring
to the Mules' playing

style. "They packed it in
the defensive third and
only sent one or two for
wards," he said.
Due to this tactic,
Muhlenburg had few
chances to score. The
Bullets outshot their op
ponents 12-5 and had
six corner kicks to their
four. It seemed as
though the Mules were
waiting to catch the Bul
lets offguard on a missed
opportunity and launch
a counter-attack, which
seldom happened.
There was little
room for error in this
game. Possession fre
quently changed hands
throughout.

Senior captain
Jesse Flynn said, "It was
the best soccer we've
played all season, but we
just couldn't finish,
which has been our big
gest problem."
Scoring was defi
nitely a challenge when
the whole Muhlenburg
team was behind the
ball. In addition to

The volleyball team suf
fered a loss to nationally
ranked Juniata College on
Tuesday. Juniata's Eagles took
the match in three games, but
the Bullets did not give them
up without a fight.
Head Coach Kim Kelly
said, "Overall I felt that we did
all right. Juniata is always a big
rival and we always seem to put
out our best against them."
The Bullets played very
well together as a team and
supported each other in keep
ing each other's energy up dur¬

ing the match.
In game one, Gettysburg
came on strong battling
through intense volleys and
worked well as a team to take
an 11-7 lead. However, the
Bullets could not succeed in
pushing the twelfth point.
"We had the first game in
the bag, but it slipped through
our fingers," said Kelly.
Juniata took the game,
15-11.
Gettysburg, burdened
with a disappointing loss, did
not enter into the second game
with the energy and momen
tum they needed. The Eagles
jumped out to a five-point lead
before Gettysburg scored their

first point.
Despite the Bullets'
strong efforts to pull together,
the score slipped to 1-12.
Sophomore Megan
Wargo said, "All the mistakes
piled up, and we were flat.
Volleyball's a big game of mo
mentum, and we just didn't
have it."
Juniata gained their sec
ond win of the match 15-3.
The Bullets knew that los
ing the third game meant los
ing the match, and they were
able to come back onto the
court with renewed energy.

Field Hockey trounces Bryn Mawr, edges Juniata
Fisher named CC Player of the Week as Lady Bullets climb to #4 in national poll

by Lisa Beideman
Staff Writer
This was a week of cel
ebration for the women's field
hockey team as they were
graced with several honors.
National rankings came
out Tuesday and the Lady Bul
lets ascended to a number four
ranking; up from last weeks
number six.
Senior Steph Fisher was
named Centennial Conference
player of the week for her out
standing performances in last
week's victories. Finally, the
team as a whole broke a con
ference record for having 19
consecutive conference wins, a
mark which dates hack to

1997. Last Saturday the field
hockey team trampled Bryn
Mawr in a conference matchup
at home, 9-0.
Quickly, in the first half,
junior forward Jenni White
tapped in two goals, both as
sisted by Fisher. Sophomore
forward Aimee Bois was next
to answer the call and find the
cage off an assist by senior Amy

Stambaugh.
At half time the score
stood at 3-0. Early in the sec
ond half senior mid-fielder
Laura DeSario shocked the
keeper with a shot assisted by
junior Kristy Moore.
Less than a minute later,
DeSario gave a little help, to
Fisher on the fifth goal of the
game. Fisher in turn passed a
ball to White in the circle for
the sixth goal of the game. That
marked three goals on the day
for White.
By the end of the half the
Bullets had found the Bryn
Mawr cage three more times,
once by sophomore forward
Amy Ludwick and twice by
sophomore forward Kaitlyn
DeMuzio.
Junior goalie, Maureen
Giese had little action on Sat
urday, but her presense on the
field was enough to keep the
other team out of the defensive
circle and to credit her with a
another shutout.
With this win the Bullets
improved to 4-0 and in the con

Within the first five min

left in the half.
Entering into the second
half the score was tied until
Stambaugh again found the
cage for her second of the day
as well as the game winner.
Despite the score, Gettys
burg outshot Juniata 25-2, but
they just couldn't seem to fin

According to Fisher, "We
know that we can't stop work

are concerned, we just didn't

This non-conference matchup

last season. However, a victory
should be no problem for such
a talented and prepared team.

Football back on track after demolishing Garnet Tide

From Staff Reports
Paul Smith rushed for
264 yards and scored four
touchdowns to lead Gettysburg
past Swarthmore, 55-8, in Cen
tennial Conference action on
Saturday. For his effort, Smith
was named the conference's
Offensive Player of the Week.
The Bullets (1-3, 1-1)
rolled up 563 yards of total
offense on the afternoon to
pick up their first win of the
1999 season. It also marked
the first time that Gettysburg
reached the 50-point plateau
since a 64-15 win over the Gar
net tide (1-2, 0-2) in 1997.
Bullet quarterback Den

10 passes on the afternoon for
103 yards and two touch
downs.
Jeff Boyd hauled in four
passes for 61 yards and a score

while linebacker Ryan Moore ing with a three-play 37-yard
led the Gettysburg defense with drive midway through the first

including seven
solo stops.
"Overall,
this game was an
attitude builder,"
said Moore. "You
could just see it at
practice over the
last week."
Ken Clark
carried 17 times
for 64 yards and
one touchdown to
lead the
Swarthmore ef

Gettysburg
opened the scor-

Smith and a 15-yard scamper
by Matt Helwig set up Smith's
three-yard touchdown run that
made it 7-0 Bullets with 6:26
left in the first quarter. Less
than five minutes later, Helwig
capped a five-play, 61-yard

Bullets improve to 3-5-1, 2-0 in CC as they defeat Washington

by Kristin Roberts
Staff Writer
The Bullet offense shined
on Saturday when the women's
soccer team hosted Washington
College. Gettysburg won the
game by a score of 7-0
against a new but strong
opponent.
As a result of this encour
aging win, the Bullets have im
proved their record again, to 3
5-1 overall, and 2-0 in the Cen
tennial Conference.
Although Washington is a
young and inexperienced team,
they played well and hard. Get
tysburg showed its skills and out
played the competition signifi
cantly.
The opening goal of the
game was scored in the 17th
minute, by
senior Amy Brewster, on
an assist by senior Lauren
Frankford. I.nter in

the half, sophomore
Maureen O'Donnell scored the
first of her two goals.
Sophomore Abi Reaser
quickly followed O'Donnell's
shot to increase the score to 3
0. The assist to Reaser came
from freshman Maura Tehrani.

Head coach Todd
Wawrousek felt it was a point of
emphasis that the Bullets main
tained a high level of play despite
the high score. "They refused
to relax and throughout the
game they took the Washington
team seriously," he said.
"That fact is evident in the
steady increase in score until the
final minutes of the game."
The Bullet defense per
sisted throughout, allowing
Washington to attempt only one
shot during the game. Backup
goalie, sophomore Amy
Campbell, entered the game dur
ing the second half and saved the
lone Washington shot.
Campbell and goalie Erin
Hayden recorded a split shutout
win. She has been working hard
at her new position, and
Wawrousek was happy for the
opportunity to give her some
playing time. He Iropes that it
helped to relieve some of her
anxiety about playing in compe
tition. Saturday's victory and the
high scoring game will prove to
be important in the upcoming
week. This game, in addition to
excessive work on finishing
shots, give the Bullets a boost in
confidence, especially in scoring.

Coming off this huge win,
the Bullets will be able to begin the week
with momentum.
The toughest week in the Bullets'
schedule this season begins Wednesday
with a night game at Muhlenberg. The
Muhlenberg team has shown very com
petitive play in the last few years, and
this will be a key conference game for
Gettysburg.

Gettysburg wasted no time in the

Senior Maureen McBrien also had
