SAC votes to dissolve itself

will take place to select SAC ofhcei s foi
the next academic teim.
SAC's leaders are cunently at
tempting to formulate a new body to
preside over student activities.
One potential idea for the replace
ment of the group involves allocating
more power to existing committees
within SAC while creating mini organi
zations, which would then be coupled
with one governing committee to over
see progress. Each division would re
ceive its own budget.
Another suggestion for restructur
ing the Student Activities Council calls
for more administrative input because
of their influence on social programming
at Gettysburg College. More interac
tion with administrators would be pur
sued as a measure to ensure that SAC's

On Monday, March 6, executive
members of SAC (Student Activities
Council) voted to dissolve in name as
a campus organization. This dissolu
tion is in name only, and the tentative
decision to disband was made in prepa
ration for a reorganization of SAC next
semester.
No official decisions about future
changes to the organization will be
made until after Spring Break.
Members of the committee will
retain their positions and carry out
planned programs for the remainder of
the semester. However, no elections

ieplacement organizations goals are
compatible with those of the College.
The Student Activities Council
was formerly responsible for organiz
ing such campus events like the Spring
and Fall Concerts, the homecoming and
Welcome Week bands, hypnotists, co
medians, as well as performers at the
Junction.
The overall goal of restructuring
the system is to make SAC a more ef
fective body on campus, with better in
put as well as greater student participa
tion in events.
SAC President Karen Parker com
mented on the disbandment of the
group, stating, "I encourage everyone
who has an interest in working with
SAC next year to get involved now, be
cause this will directly impact you."

The fitness room gets a workout

Remember the fitness room
tucked into a corner of the basement
of Plank Gym? Take a good look at
it, because plans are in the works for
the fitness facilities at Gettysburg Col
lege to be given a major face-lift in

the near future.
Many people,
including John
Regentin, Director
of Experiential
Education, and
Brad McCutheon,
Program Coordina

current fitness
room failing in its
purpose. The
equipment is either
broken, damaged,

and not conducive
to a complete work

Some students raised
concerns at Monday's Stu
dent Senate meeting where
Mr. Regentin and Mr.
McCutheon presented the in
formation. Some worried
about privacy, especially since
so many club offices are lo
cated in the basement of
Plank. Mr. Regentin said that
it is recommended that the
GRAB, Black Student Union,
and Senate offices should
open to the outside hallways
rather than into the room.
Also, since the entire room

would be dedicated to woik
mg out, the amount of traffic
that flows through that area
currently would be dimin
ished. Another concern was
whether or not athletic teams
would be permitted to mo
nopolize the room. The Sen
ate was assured that since it
is labeled a student facility, in
dividual athletes will obvi
ously be allowed to use it, but
no team unit will be able to
claim the space as its own.
The weight room in Bream
will remain the same to meet
the needs of athletic teams.

On the green between Musselman Hall and Christ Chapel, sunbathers took advantage of the
cloudless sky and record high-temperatures to soak up a few rays, play frisbee and frolic. First
year Kelly Lovett, junior Courtney Wege and first-year Katie Nahmias moved their studies out of
the library and into the sun.
Across campus, many students and faculty spent the afternoon out of doors. Some profes
sors held classes on the lawn between Glatfelter Hall and Pennsylvania Hall, while students took a

may not be legal in a neighbor
ing nation. Some young people
are victimized because they
may be unaware of the laws,
customs or standards of the
country they are visiting.
Besides drugs, alcohol
can also get U.S. citizens in
trouble abroad. Students have
been arrested for being intoxi
cated in public areas, underage
drinking and drunk driving.
Some Americans go abroad as
suming that local authorities
will overlook such conduct.
Many believe that they are im
mune from prosecution in for
eign lands because they are
American citizens. Americans
are expected to obey all of the
laws of the countries they visit,
and those who break them are
subject to penalties.
Disorderly or reckless

As the time approaches
for spring or summer breaks,
many college students are get
ting ready for that much antici
pated trip abroad. Most will
have a safe and enjoyable ad
venture, but for some, the trip
will become a nightmare. A
number of ruined vacations are
caused by one or more of the
following' drugs, alcohol and
disorderly behavior.
Each year, more than
2,500 American citizens are
arrested abroad - about half on
narcotics charges. A drug that
may be legal in one country

behavior is also to be avoided.
In many countries, conduct
that would not result in an ar
rest in the U.S. constitutes a
violation of local law. It is cru
cial that young Americans be
aware of this risk as they are
enjoying their time abroad.
Being arrested is not the
only thing that can happen on
a foreign vacation. Americans
have been killed in car acci
dents, drownings and falls due
to heavy drinking and drug use.
Others have been raped or
robbed because they have
found themselves in unfamiliar
locales while incapable of ex
ercising prudent judgement.

price of the items recom
mended. The purchase of
state-of-the-art equipment has
been proposed and the prices
speak to that. One treadmill
alone would run about $5000
with the other items would
run close to that number.
There are funds allocated for
the use by Campus Recre
ation, but the purchases must
be approved before any
money is spent.
Lost in all of the fitness
excitement is the fate of the
game room. Dean Dennis
Murphy is talking to students
about their needs regarding
the game room and questions
or concerns should be di
rected to him.

While the original plan
called for these changes to be
made and in place by the end
of Spring Break, the extent of
the work to be done renders
that impossible. The new goal
is to have the fitness room up
and running by the end of the
summer and ready for student
use in the fall. At most, the
current fitness room will be
cleared of faulty equipment,
including the nautilus ma
chines, next week to give stu
dents a bit more room to
move for the remainder of this
semester.

• By Libby Musselman
• This week Libby is asking the
»questions instead of answering them.
• She noticed the Uncle Sam post
• ers around the library and saw that Jean
•Luc got a seasonal change of clothing,
• and is sporting a bubble with the words:
•"We want you to tell us what you
Jthinlc."
• Libby talked with a reference li
brarian (RL) about the WE WANT YOU
•campaign, (see box on page 7).
• Libby: So what's up with the
# Uncle Sam posters around campus?
• RL: The library really wants YOU
* to tell us what you think! We are hav
• ing focus group sessions after Spring
* Break to find out what students really
•think about the library.

• Libby: What's a focus group?
* RL: A focus group is a group in
•terview. Someone (NOT a librarian,

because we wouldn't want you to be and talking
anything but honest) will talk with 6-

10 students at once, for about an hour.
We'll discuss the library building, the
library website (how you use it, what
you think of it, how it can be better),
getting help in the library (do you find
what you need? what can we improve?),
and the physical arrangement of the
building ( do you know where every
thing is?).
Libby: Why are you going to all
this trouble? I think the library is fine
just the way it is.
RL: Thanks for the compliment,
but really, we're always trying to get
better. We have some ideas about how
to improve the library but you and your
friends are the ones who use the collec
tion and the services night and day. We
want your honest opinion.
Libby: This sounds good, but my
first reaction is "I'm so busy with school
right now and I don't have time to do
your focus group."

RL: We know you are busy, but
we also know that you probably spend
at least an hour hanging out in the li
brary every day anyway, so why not get
rewarded for sitting around the library

Libby: Rewarded?
RL: We want students from all
four classes to participate in our focus
groups and we'd like it to be worth your
time. Each focus group participant will
receive a GETTCARD with a $5 credit
on it. You can use GETTCARDs in the
library (photocopiers), in the Bullet
Hole (food), in campus vending ma
chines (more food), or in campus laun
dry machines (clean clothes!).
Libby. How can a student sign up?
RL: Call the reference desk at
x6600 or stop by to sign up. We'd love
to hear from YOU!
Spring break hours: The library

The Twenties roar into Kline Theater

by Barb Dickson
Editor-in-Chief
The Owl and Nightingale Players
took a few shots at Hollywood during
a performance that would make Broad
way proud.
The Theater Department put on
its fall show Once in a Lifetime last
weekend, delighting audiences with the
1930 spoof. Written by George S.
Kaufman and Moss Hart, the play tells
the story of the second-rate vaudeville
team of Daniels, Hyland and Lewis who
journeys to Hollywood with the advent
of talking movies. The three plan to
open an elocution school to help silent
movie actors learn to talk. Along the
way they find love, success, and disap
pointment.
From beginning to end, the show
was an excellently performed delight.
Junior Paul Lapato began the show as
the dim-witted George Lewis, the

straight man of the trio. He acts as the
perfect foil for the other members of
the group, May Daniels (senior
Samantha Gregg) and Jerry Hyland
(junior Brad Cenlh).
Jerry enters, just having seen the
revolutionary talkie The Jazz Singei and
proposes that the down-on-their luck
team head to Hollywood. Along the
way they meet up with famous Holly
wood columnist Helen Hobart (Paula
Henderson), whom they soon convince
to help with their school.
George also meets aspiring actress
Susan Walker (Emily Simmons) on the
train and immediately falls in love.
The antics of the group as they
try to climb the Hollywood ladder left
the audience laughing throughout the
night. All of the leads were very strong.
A definite highlight to the evening
was sophomore Dan Wilson as
Lawrence Vail, a Broadway writer trans
planted the waiting room of a Holly
wood studio. One of a shipment of six¬

teen, Vail quickly giew sick of the pad
ded rooms _wntets were placed in and
decided to take up his problems with
studio head Herman Glogauer (Reco
Gngsby). His growing frustration
throughout his dealings with secretaiy
Miss Leighton (Juliet Dunham) proved
excessively amusing.
Lapato and Simmons made a cute
couple as George and Susan, and I came
to care about them. Their scenes to
gether and the frustration they caused
May were among the funniest in the
play. Simmons was perfect as Susan, and
Lapato was hilarious as "Dr." Lewis.
One of the weaker elements of the
play was the relationship between May
and Jerry. The couple is apparently
engaged, though the interaction be
tween them really doesn't show it. • I
felt more upset by the breakup of a co
medic team than the breakup of a ro
mantic couple at the end of the play.

Though Cenlh did an outstand
ing job as Jerry, there wasn't much there

tot him to woik with. His transforma
tion in Hollywood took a backseat to
the various other stoiyhnes, and while
I was happy at the reunion of May and
Jerry, it was not a relationship about
which I cared.
To entertain the audience during
scene changes, a few songs were added
and performed by the actors. While
some voices were stronger than others
(Gregg, as always, sounded wonderful),
the songs were a good way to prevent
the audience from losing interest as the
very innovative sets were changed.
If you saw the play and enjoyed
it, I have to recommend the Gene Kelly
movie Singin' in the Rain. It also tells
the tale of Hollywood during this pe
riod, but the point of view is that of the
actors'. If you enjoyed Once in a Life
time, you'll love this classic movie.
Altogether the show was very en
tertaining, and if you didn't get a chance
to see Once in a Lifetime, you really
missed out on a fun evening.

Dolan stirs audiences with writing and speaking

By Anne Schenk
Book Reviewer
].D. Dolan. Phoenix: A
Brother 's Life. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 2000.
192 pp.
For those of you who
missed all of the posters, ad
vertisements, and even an ar
ticle in the Gettysburgian, au
thor J.D. Dolan was on cam
pus last week to promote his

first book, Phoenix: A
Brother's Life. Dolan, a
professor at Western
Michigan University, starts
a 38 city promotional tour
later this month, but
Gettysburg College was
lucky enough to host his
first reading.
Phoenix is the story
of Dolan's childhood,
growing up in a near dys
functional family in Los
Angeles, and of the one
event that chances his fam¬

ily forever.
On Sunday, June 9,
1985, a large steam line ex
ploded at the Mohave Gener
ating Station in Laughlin, Ari
zona. Sixteen people were
injured when the 1000 degree
steam blew through metal
doors into the room where
they were in the middle of a
shift-change. The men were
burned, their faces and bod
ies made unrecognizable by
the extreme temperatures.
Among them was John Dolan,
J.D.'s older brother by eleven
years, whom he had wor¬

shipped as a child and thought
of as almost a parent.
J.D. was in Pans when
he got the call. It was bad, he
was told, and yes, he should
come home immediately. J.D.
flew home, but not home to
the brother he worshipped.
Things had changed. The si¬

lence and bitterness that ruled his ful and poignant balance_,
house growing up had taken their So, Gettysburg students,

toll on John and the relationship be
tween the two brothers.
Five years had passed since
they had spoken and now, J.D. re
alized, they would never speak
again. The silence that ruled the re
lationship between John and J.D.
for half a decade now forces J.D. to
learn from outsiders what the life
John was losing was like, and also
to look within himself to find love
in a family so emotionally torn
apart. J.D.'s story is painfully tragic.
It dances among the fading memo
ries of his childhood, the resentment
and bitterness that plague his fam
ily, and the pain of losing a sibling.
Its bare truth and emotional open
ness, however, are uplifting.
Dolan's writing is clear and his in
sight into his own life, on the brink
of greater things as his brother's
comes to an end, provides a beauti-

next time you see those posters
advertising for writers and po
ets reading their work, don't
miss it! Attending lets students
hear the voices who are shaping
literature today, and also intro
duces some good reading mate
rial.

The exercise top 10

by Kara Miller, Kelly Berklf,
Krlsten Petrovia, Suzy Lynch
& Keri Hymen
Contributing Writers
Although it may seem like the
majority of Gettysburg students are
involved in sports and fitness, we
would like to inform all students of
the many benefits of exercise and
physical fitness. Although some
benefits of exercise are known, here
are the top ten reasons to exercise:
1. Keeps weight under control
by elevating metabolism so that you
burn more calories every day.
2. Increases your fitness ca
pacity, or energy level. This allows
a person to have more energy at the
end of the day and be less fatigued.
3. Helps manage stress and
release tension.
4. Improves sleep patterns by
increasing the ability to fall asleep
and sleep well.

5. Improves self-image.
6. Counters anxiety and de
pi ession and increases enthusiasm
and optimism.
7. Increases good (HDL) cho
lesteml.
8. Decreases blood pressure.
9. Reduces risk of heait dis
ease by increasing blood circulation.
10. Increases strength of
bones, therefore pi eventing bone
loss.

We could continue, but we
think you get the idea. Seeing
that physical fitness has so many
benefits, why wait any longer?
Here at Gettysburg College, stu
dents have the opportunity to
try several different kinds of
exercise, either as individuals or
with a team. The hours of the
Gettysburg facilities that are
available for exercise are:

Letters to the Editor

Administrative apology
The Gettysburgian has carried ar
ticles and letters to the editor for the
past several weeks outlining my ac
tions in the post office in regard to
the collection of names of those who
had purchased books from various
online sellers. The front-page article
that appeared in one recent edition
of The Gettysburgtan did a very fine
job describing some of the issues in
volved in dealing with the online
sellers of books and ordering via the
web. These issues affect everyone in
the college community.
We have studied a number of
bookstore options. The first is to
outsource or contract the entire
store to a company that provides
such service. This would have re
sulted in the Gettysburg College
store looking and operating similarly
to those at hundreds of other

schools. We looked into partnering
with one of the online sellers so that
all course material would be sold via
the Internet at an approved site. To
date we have not found one that
would benefit the College commu
nity without imposing a burden on
the students, faculty and the school.
This lead us to improve upon the
services that the Gettysburg College
Bookstore has traditionally pro
vided.
I realize that I was overzealous
in my attempt to try to understand
the entire online purchasing experi
ence from the user point of view, and
for this I am sorry. While my judge
ment may have been flawed, I main
tain that my motive was never mali
cious. It was never my intention to
prevent anyone from being able to
shop online.

The college bookstore should
be a source of pride for an institu
tion of higher learning. It should be
a resource for everyone on campus
devoted to the people it serves and
the academic mission of the college.
The Gettysburg College Bookstore
is proud of all of the contributions
it has made for many years, both fis
cal and service. We invite anyone
who would like to help us ensure
that it remains an integral part of
the community to join our advisory
committee. Please contact Kim Wolf
at the College Store for more details.

We should all like Ike
As many of you know, the stu
dent body of Gettysburg College has
been asked to decide the name of
the new Italian eatery above the
Bullet Hole. I am writing this to
those of you who have not yet voted
for one of the four final choices with
an impassioned plea to choose a
name that honors one of the great
est men who has ever devoted his
life to the service of our great na
tion. This man is, of course, Dwight
David Eisenhower.
Ike was born to a humble fam
ily, and grew up with his five broth
ers in Abilene Kansas. His parents
instilled in him a strong work ethic,
and from a very young age he
worked to help support his family.
After he graduated from high school
he continued to work so that one of
his brothers could afford to attend
the University of Michigan. Finally,
at the age of 21, Eisenhower left

Consider This

Today the library was filled with more confused and flustered
students than usual. The sentiments were not all a result of the
typical pre-Spring Break work overload. No, for some it was rather
that when they picked up a phone in the library to make an on
campus call, before they dialed a number, they heard a ringing,
and found themselves being connected to Safety and Security.
There has been a lot of complaining about people abusing
_, the red phones in the library, using them to

made by people talki

studying. But completely taking away the convenience of these
phones is not the answer.
Besides, how many fires, robberies and sexual assaults ac
tually take place in the library?

make extensive calls to friends. True, this is
not what the phones are for, but there are
more emergencies than those that Safety
and Security deals with.
The library is a popular meeting place
for class groups. When only two people out
of a group of five show up for a meeting about
a project due the next day, that's an emer
gency.
When someone realizes that they won't
be able to make it to dinner or to a meeting
like they thought they would, that's an emer
gency.
These may not be the situations that li
brary administration feels constitute an emer
gency, but when a student is running behind
and knows other people will be affected, the
inconvenience of walking to the phone out
side of Stine and calling is a great one.

There has to be a middle ground be
tween using the library phones as a social
connection and using them for our everyday
academic emergencies. How much money
was spent altering the phones? Could it
have been put towards something aca
demic?
Perhaps there is some way of institut
ing a time limit on the phones, or moving
them to more isolated locations so the noise
ng loudly to friends doesn't interrupt others'

Celebrating the "Irish" spirit...whatever that means

by LA. LsHtRwoon
Social Commentator
In a week and a day this
nation, and indeed the world,
will celebrate a formerly reli
gious holiday (it still is in some
remote parts like Ireland) by
drinking lots of cheap colored
beer and wearing stupid little
plastic hats reminiscent of the
famous Irish stereotype in 19th
century Punch illustrations.
Yes, it is March and St. Paddy's
is a little more than a week
away from us. For those of us

who do not indulge in boiled
processed meat and strong
black beer, it might seem like
just another glorified day on
which we are forced to subject
ourselves to whatever deprav
ity prevails. This is the nature
of a day when people celebrate
being of Irish descent, and it is
the only day where one culture
out of the vast number which
inhabit our land, is singled out
for celebration.
I suppose that my whole
issue about this holiday is a very

basic question. What is being
"lush", and moreover, what is
the place of the Irish in
America? Now I know that
PBS and others have spent time
and money trying to relay the
plight of the Irish people in
America, so that is not my in¬

tention.
I truly believe that what
is "Irish" is not universal in
definition, and indeed it is not
something that we can classify
and stereotype so easily. For
example, does being Irish mean
being a citizen of the Repub
lic? Or a radical in Belfast fight
ing for Ian Paisley? Or is it be
ing a member of the Demo
cratic Party which has managed
to get a Kennedy elected in
Massachusetts twice since the
beginning of the Cold War?
What is this thing that we call
Irish, and why is it so appeal
ing? There is no such thing as
a truly "pure" ethnic group in
the world. We are all a prod
uct of centuries of gene swap
ping, and it is impossible for
any one person to claim to be

"moie Irish" than the next 1
believe that what people iden
tify with moie is a tie to a vast
Celtic heritage which follows
hand in hand with the roman
ticism surrounding the plight of
the emerald isle. At the same
time, this Celtic heritage is not
something solely linked to Ire
land, but rather something uni
versal and appealing to those
without the natural tie of be
ing blessed with "Irish" blood.
Even in Ireland they have
fought bloody fights over who

is actually more Irish than who.
Are the Anglo-Irish truly Irish?
Or are the Ulstermen of Scot
tish descent four hundred years
removed? Is a Protestant Irish?
Is a Catholic a heathen? What
is this thing that we all wish
everyone on March 17th every
single year with cards adorned
with little leprechauns and pots
of gold? Trust me, if there was
any gold to be had in Ireland,
the English were off with it
years ago. Why do we call our
selves so Irish, and why do we
cherish such a torn and embit
tered land?

Maybe it is because we as
Americans always have a habit
of rooting tor the undeidog.
We love the idea of romantic
lost causes, and for so many
years, through private clubs
created out of the persecution
of the early Irish immigrants,
we embraced the IRB and later
the terrorist Irish Republican
Army. The Irish have fought
an uphill battle in this nation,
and some may still claim per
secution and compensation
from the English, the Scots or
the Protestants.
In hindsight, however, we
know that such organizations
formed along religious and eth
nic lines only contributed more
to the violence and destruction
which has raped Ireland more
in this century than almost any
other. The years of violence
have only begotten violence,
and psychologically the Irish
have a lot of work ahead of
them.

To me, what it means to
be Irish is simply being one who
embraces a fine culture known
for its song, literature, love of

life, wit, spirit and whiskey. I
don't love the violence or the
senseless persecution by those
claiming to be the true "citi
zens" of the land. What I love
is the actual land; the idea of
what Ireland as a mystical place
could be rather than what it is.
I will embrace the richness of a
culture that perhaps flourishes
better in times of trouble. Just
look at Irish music and litera
ture for an example.
Finally, this St. Paddy's I
will think not of Ireland, but
more of a certain Celtic spirit

which can inspire all people
with its poetry. In closing, I in
vite those of you who are of age
to the reopening of
Gettysburg's own beloved Irish
pub on Steinwehr Avenue. The
establishment, formerly known
as Buckley's will be reopened
on March 16th, just in time for
St. Patrick's. The new name is
Paddy O'Rourke's and it will
remain an Irish pub. If any of
you are here over break, I in
vite you to join me there for a
weekend of celebration of this
Celtic spirit.

Abilene for West Point.
Soon after his gradua
tion from West Point, the
First World War broke out
in Europe. It was when the
United States became in
volved in this conflict that
Eisenhower first came to
Gettysburg. A major in the
United States Army, he came
to train the soldiers and of
ficers who would fight for
freedom and democracy on
the killing fields of France.
After the end of WWI
Eisenhower served on the
staff of General MacArthur
in the Philippines and on the
general staff of the United
States Army in Washington
DC. It was here that
Eisenhower would begin to
truly make his mark on the
world. General George C.
Marshall recognized Ike's

potential and made him the
supreme commander of the
American forces that were
sent to fight the illustrious
German Afrika Korp in
North Africa. After a string
of military victories in Africa
and Italy Eisenhower was
made the Supreme Allied
Commander of the Allied
military forces in Europe.
His greatest hour in the
WWII came with the suc
cessful invasion of France,
and the drive of the Allied
forces under his command
advanced into Germany. Af
ter the end of the Second
World War, Eisenhower re
turned to the United States
a hero. He sought to con
tinue his life with a career
outside the military, and be
came the President of Co¬

lumbia University. However,

- continued from page 9 -
duty called again, and
Eisenhower found himself in
Europe serving as the first
supreme commander of a
fledgling NATO.
Though he was a man
who had always worked out
side of politics, Eisenhower
found himself running for
President in 1952. Ike ran
not for personal glory, but
because of massive public
outcry encouraging him to
run. He was successful, and
he next eight years were
some of the most prosperous
in American history. In the
midst of the Cold War,
Eisenhower managed to
keep the United States out of
any major conflicts, even
though war with the Soviet
Union seemed imminent at
times. For eight years Ike
kept the world from becom¬

ing a nuclear slagheap.
After Eisenhower left
the office of President in
1961, he retired to the home
in Gettysburg he had built
during his Presidency. He
wrote his memoirs in the
building that today serves as
the admissions office for
Gettysburg College. He
lived out the rest of his years
in the town that he loved,
and when possible helped
our College in many ways.
Dwight David
Eisenhower is, unquestion
ably, one of the greatest
American patriots of the
twentieth century. To this
end I feel it is the least we as
a college community can do
to honor his memory in
some small way. I ask you if
you have not voted yet,
please do so now. Send a

message to everyone that we
as a community choose sub
stance over flash. Please,
honor a man who devoted
his life to the United States
of America, Dwight David
Eisenhower, IKE.

Breaking through economic barriers

by Rachel Hanson
Columnist
Members of both the
Democratic and Republican
parties claim that they have the
best plan to help the most so
cially and economically op
pressed members of our soci
ety. While I will admit that
there are good aspects to both
of the parties' ideas, I also think
a number of well-intentioned
people have missed one of the
most important steps in help
ing those who are most in need:
realizing the fact that they can
not take their own ideals and
experiences and expect to be
able to apply them to the lives
of others.

This is a process that I am
currently using to try to fine
tune myself. I am volunteering
with a Girl Scout troop in town
that is comprised of some of the
most economically deprived
girls in Gettysburg, particularly
those from the Hispanic and
African-American communi
ties. When I first started work
ing with this troop, I expected
that I could take my own Girl
Scout experiences and apply

them to problems and situa
tions that I would encounter
there. However, I quickly
learned that I would not be able
to do this.
1 naively had not realized
that the very different eco
nomic and social position of
these girls would affect every
aspect of their lives, including
their Girl Scout experience.
Their troop is funded by the
local Girl Scout council, and
they therefore have much less
money and resources than I did

when I was younger, which
means that they will also have
fewer opportunities than I did.
In order for me to fully
understand these girls and their
lives, I had to leave my own
comfortable life as a white,
privileged student and step into
their lives as minority, eco
nomically deprived girls. Once
I did this, I was better able to
see the number of different fac
tors that influence their lives
and was, in a sense, able to see
the world through their eyes.

I think everyone needs to
realize that people's lives are
different, especially those of
the "lower class." Their eco
nomic situation affects every

aspect of their life and this is
something that should be kept
in mind.
I also think that my fel
low students and I have a won
derful opportunity to really
experience the lives of "poor"
minorities in America n-ght
here in Gettysburg. We have
an overwhelmingly large His
panic population, as well as a
good-sized Black community.
Gettysburg is very segregated,
and many of these people live
in the much poorer sections ot

. I do want to make it clear,
however, that I am not imply
ing that all "poor" people are
minorities or all minorities are
"poor." The point I am trying
to make is that a large percent
age of the "poor," especially in
Gettysburg, are from minority
groups.
Of course, the first step
in trying to understand the lives
of these people is to just ac
knowledge the fact that they
exist. At a recent meeting of a
campus organization, one
member was surprised to learn
that Gettysburg even had a His
panic community. For nearly a
year, he had somehow

"missed" this entire group of
Gettysburg's population. We
need to first stop being so blind
to our surroundings and open
our eyes and see the fact that
everyone is not like us!
Once we have recognized
the fact that there is a sizable
minority group in Gettysburg
(and the world) that is eco
nomically disadvantaged,
working with them, just spend
ing time with them, and even
talking with them, as fellow
human beings will enable us to
better understand them and
what their lives are like. We
cannot expect to be able to of
fer any sort of help or compas
sion if we first do not realize
that while these people may be
different from us, they are still
human beings and deserve to
be treated with respect.

We can get an idea of the
lives of Gettysburg's (and other
areas') most disadvantaged
through a number of ways.
The Center for Public Service
has a number of opportunities
to get involved. You can work
with the migrant communities
in Gettysburg or you can travel
to Baltimore and tutor similarly
disadvantaged children at

Sandtown. Or, if you feel so
inclined, you can do some work
on your own through organi
zations such as the Girl Scouts,
the YWCA and the local
schools and daycare centers.
And if you are really strapped
for time, there are less involved
things that you can do. The
next time you buy a pack of
cigarettes at the 7-11, stop and
actually have a conversation
with the person serving you.
You may be surprised at the
things they have to say. Or just
take a walk through the areas
ot Gettysburg where these

people live and just try to get a
sense of what then lives must
be like.
We all need to realize that
everyone does not lead the
same lives that we do, and un
til everyone comes to this un
derstanding, the most op
pressed members of our soci
ety will continue to be op
pressed. But we also need to
keep in mind that their differ
ences do not make them any
less human. We need to stop
applying our own _experiences
and expectations to their lives,
while also respecting and lov
ing them as fellow people.

Where has the excitement in American politics gone?

by Christina Dickert
Political Columnist
All across the nation this
week, Super Tuesday fever had
political buffs glued to their
television sets to see the re
turns. Many believe that the
results of Tuesday's elections
could indeed predict the nomi
nees that will be facing off in
November's general election.
On the Republican side,
George W. Bush swept Super
Tuesday. John McCain, riding
high after his win in New
Hampshire in Februaiy, took a
direct blow to his campaign
with the Super Tuesday results.
The attack on the Christian
right that spawned from his

tvom the .feminist .trout

South Carolina campaign (and them have paiticipated in ovei
his dealings with Bob Jones the past few months.

University) only hurt his
chances of winning the prima
ries. Alan Keyes received any
where from 3-7% of the votes,
which is a normal showing for
him. On the Democratic side,
Al Gore followed suit by
sweeping the democratic pri
maries. As I am writing this,
Bill Bradley is preparing to
drop out of the presidential
race. He feels that it would be
better to step aside and let Gore
reunite the Democratic party.
Bradley is even feeling so gen
erous that he is going to en
dorse Al Gore, even after the
very tense (and sometimes very
mean) debates that the two of

Irom the lUmimi ' s Mouth

I am a bit disappointed in
the results of the Super Tues
day primaries, not just because
the candidate that I am sup
porting (Bill Bradley) is drop
ping out of the race. I am more
disappointed in the fact that
this race has been decided since
the beginning of last year. Ev
erywhere you go, the buzz was
that the contest in November
would be between George W.
Bush and Al Gore. I have heard
people say that they are endors
ing one candidate over the
other (both Democrats and
Republicans) because they are
most probably going to win
their respective party's nomi
nations.

When did issues fall out
of this rnce ? Why aie people
not looking at the _lnfonnation
on the candidates instead of
just accepting the status quo?
Why do people feel compelled
to vote foi a mainstream can
didate?
As someone interested in
politics, this is one contest that
is not catching my eye. This
race (including the winner in
November) was decided long
ago. Now, America is just go
ing through the motions of a
primary season. Why can't
politics be as exciting as they
weie way back when people
had to sit on the edge of then
seats, wondering who was go
ing to win? Who can forget
President Harry Truman hold¬

ing up the very misinformed
newspaper that printed
"Dewey Defeats Truman" a few
houis too early?
Now, American politics
are so predictable that people
have voter empathy. They
don't even want to go to the
polls anymore because they feel
like their vote won't make a dif
ference. Something needs to
change in the American politi
cal system. People need to get
excited about the election sea
son, not bored. People need to
get involved, not just sit back
and take what comes at them.
We need a new wave of politi
cal excitement, and it's not go
ing to come from the cookie
cutter candidates that we see on
TV.

From Staff Report*.
Gettysburg opened its 2000 cam
paign with a convincing 20-8 win at
Drew on Saturday. The Bullets were led
by attackers Ric Bremer and senior Ross
Garretson. Bremer, a sophomore,
scored a career-high five goals, while
Garretson added four goals and two
assists.
Sophomore Pete Milliman and
Kevin Callahan chipped in three and
two goals, respectively. Both recorded
two assists.
Gettysburg scored the first six
goals of the game and maintained a 7-1
advantage after the first quarter. Dur
ing this spurt, Bremer, Callahan and
Mark Pollak scored consecutive goals
in the game's first three minutes and 38
seconds.
Twenty-five seconds after Drew's
lone goal of the quarter, sophomore
Wes Cadman answered back for the
Bullets, capping off the first quarter
scoring with 1:30 remaining.

The Bullets took a quick 8-1 ad
vantage in the second quarter after jun
ior Charlie Hanchett found the back of
the net just.46 seconds into the second
session. But Drew scored four times in
the period to pull within 1 1-5 before
Gettysburg closed out the final four
minutes of the half with goals from

Pollak, Milliman and Bremer.
Junior Tommy Pearce led the Bul
lets with three assists and freshman Pe
ter Politi added his first collegiate goal
in the win. 1999 Division III Goalie of
the Year Andrew Barter recorded nine
saves. For the game, Gettysburg out shot
Drew 47-24.
Gettysburg is ranked third in the
nation and visits No. 5 Washington &
Lee University this Sunday. Game time
is 1 p.m.
