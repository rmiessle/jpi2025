Dirt, power tools, and yellow cau
tion tape - with plans for construction
of a new science building in February
the campus will be seeing all of these
things.
The building that will be almost
two times the size of Glatfelter is sched
uled for ground breaking
in February, but many

eluded in the project. The temporary
green house will be located near the Cen
tral Energy Building, which is currently
under construction. Special storage
space, computer labs, hazardous and
flammable material spaces are being in
cluded in the details of the project.
DeNicola mentioned all of the
people involved in this project helping
to make decisions on the building. Fac
ulty, administration, department heads,

¦lble, is a beautiful building, and
there are no regrets," pointed
out DeNicola.

and the architecture firm Ballinger from
Philadelphia, meets every two weeks to
discuss plans and make decisions.
"We start with large empty boxes
and kept moving in to final details," said
DeNicola. Chairs, orientation of the
classroom, and outlet position are just
some of the minor details that need to
be worked out. Currently, refining the
details is what DeNicola and others in
volved are working on.
What will happen with
Breindenbaugh? "We are going to used
it for 'swing space' to 'unpack density'
from other buildings," said DeNicola. It
will remain an academic building on cam
pus. The building will have several small
and large classrooms, labs, a lounge, and
common areas for student faculty re
search collaboration, according to David
Giordano, a project manager for Strate
gic Building Solutions. He pointed out
that the current work the campus is see
ing is the rerouting of the underground

site facilities. A contractor is doing this
to prepare for the building of the new
science center.
Glass will be a large part of the
structure with several windows on each
side so the campus can have a "science
in sight" view. A winding staircase and
tower that will be lit up at night is also
a part of the structure made of glass.
Most importantly, however, will be the
glass connection between McCreary
and the new uildmg. This is to
promote the idea of a science
quadrangle and provide unity

between disciplines.
The building, with aggres
sive planning and cooperative
weather will make it available in
the fall of 2001. If not, it will
open the next spring.
"The building is going to
have an impact on the campus.
It is going to represent a boost
to not only the quality of the
science programs, but student
interest in the science programs.
We want to make sure it is flex-

A second phase of the
project will include renovations in the
rest of the science buildings including
Master's and McCreary. McCreary will
be renovated to make it an enclosed
square. Masters will have some class
room and other minor renovations.
DeNicola pointed out three main
reasons why the project will be impor
tant to students. First, the building is
designed with a variety of classroom
styles that are made to be comfortable.
Second, it is designed for student-fac
ulty collaborative research. Finally, the
many student lounges and common ar
eas will provide for easy meeting ar
rangements.
"A lot has been put into the plan
ning of this building structurally. There
will be natural light, a variety of class
rooms and much more. People should
be excited," said Giordano.

"The building will mean noise,
trucks and some annoyances, but it will
definitely be worth it in the end," said
DeNicola.

Gettysburg's Science department
expands

more plans have been
made concerning it.
Daniel R. DeNicola, Pro
vost of the College, ex
plained the need for the
new building.
"We want to make
the science departments as
strong as they can be," said
DeNicola. Environmental
Science currently has no
official space of its own. It
holds classes in both the
Chemistry and Biology de
partments and whereever
else it can fit in. The col
lege wants to expand ES,
and a very high tech GIS,

or Geographical Information Systems
lab is going to be included of the build
ing. The Chemistry and Biology depart
ments are also spread out across cam
pus, making collaborative courses be
tween the disciplines less convenient
than is necessary. Courses in areas such
as neuroscience will be added to the
course catalog because of the new space
and convenience.
Besides these problems, HES
shares its space with the athletic depart
ment, and since it is science-based, also
needs sufficient room for courses and
labs. According to DeNicola, all of these
problems and concerns resulted in the
suggestion of a new building. The sci
ence departments aren't the only ones
to benefit. Computer Science and Math
will also be in this building of around
86,000 square feet as well as some other
courses in various other disciplines.

A green house and animal care fa
cility for all departments will be in

Abe Lincoln: Marriage from hell?

adds. A graduate of Goucher
College and Johns Hopkins

Democrats in Mid-Century
America," "Maryland: A His
toiy of Its People," "Mary

Honest Abe may have
viewed his marriage as his jour

professor and author who will
speak at Gettysburg College on
the anniversary of President
Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
"In November 1842, a
24-year-old young woman,
known as the Belle of Spring
field, married a tall 33-year-old
lawyer who was just making his
way into the Illinois capitol's
legal and social circles," said
Jean H. Baker. "The wedding
cakes were still warm in what

some believed was a last
minute arrangement, and the
bridegroom was reported to
have said he was on his way to
hell." The Elizabeth Todd Pro
fessor of History at Goucher
College, Baker will discuss
"The Lincoln Marriage: Be
yond the Battle of Quotations"
at 8:00 p.m., November 19, in
the CUB. Her talk, the 38th
annual Robert Fortenbaugh
Memorial Lecture, will be fol
lowed by a reception. Both are
open to the public free of

China's potential
entry into the World
Trade Organization re
mains controversial.
However, a recent agree
ment with the United
States paves the way for
that to happen. Human
Rights Watch believes
that membership would
have a positive effect in
areas such as workers'
rights, press freedom and
justice. The organization
first recommends that
Congress link the grant
ing of Normal Trade Re
lation status with im
provements in human
rights. If the deal goes

through, China would be
come the 135th member
of the WTO.
Togo
Hundreds of dead
bodies were found
washed up on the shore of
this west African nation.
Some of the bodies
showed signs of torture.
That was in June 1998,
around the time of the
presidential election. Am
nesty International re
leased a report on the in
cident in May 1999. The
Togo government
promptly sued the organi
zation. The government's
misconduct did not stop
there though. "Witnesses"
were payed to appear in
court and contradict the
statements of human

witnesses and investiga
tors were harassed or ar
rested. But there may be
some hope, as Togo has
just agreed to an interna
tional commision to in'
vestigate the matter.

The Ethiopian
courts announced the
first death sentence for
human rights abuses by
the military and previous

5;000 people are being
tried for crimes against
humanity and genocide
between 1974 and 1991.
The president during that

at Kent State

By TMS Campus
KENT, Ohio (TMS) —
Students wanting to bring a
predominantly gay fraternity
to Kent State University are
hoping theft of many of the
flyers they've posted isn't a
sign of things to come-.
"I'm approaching this
with an open mind and an
open heart," Todd Mashlan,
programming director for the
campus' Lesbian, Gay, Bi
sexual Union, told the Daily
Kent Stater. "Of course ... re
jection is part of our expecta
tion." The students want to
start a new chapter of Delta
Lambda Phi, which was estab
lished in 1986 and has 24
chapters nationwide. They're
billing the fraternity as a gi oup
for "gay, bisexual and progres
sive men who can't abide by
the homophobia that does still

exist," Mashlan said.
To get the group off the
ground, the students must get
approval from the fraternity's
national organization and
from Kent State's Inter-Frater
nity Council. They're not as
worried about meeting the na
tional group's requirements as
they are getting support from
the 18 fraternities already on
KSU's campus, Mashlan said.
Ara Simonetti, president
of the council told the Daily
Kent Stater he would have "no
problem" with the establish
ment of a Delta Lambda Phi
chapter on campus.
"This is a different orga
nization for people who join,"
he said. "I'm of the opinion
that that's good. Maybe some
of the men wouldn't be confi
dent being in some of the
other fraternities, so Delta
Lambda Phi would be a good
fit for them, and they wouldn't
have to feel uncomfortable."

Servo Thanksgiving Dinner:
Worth all the hype?

A crack team of critics heads to the Dining Center to investigate

by Elizabeth Bauerlein
Contributing Writer

This past Tuesday night the stu
dent body of Gettysburg College was
treated to an annual Thanksgiving Din
ner at the campus Dining Center. This
campus tradition has been highly re
galed as one of the best and certainly
the most popular dinner the Dining
Center hosts.
First year students finally got
to experience the meal that has
helped catapult Gettysburg's dining f
services into the Princeton Review's
Top Ten. Many students heard
about the famous Thanksgiving

dinner on their tours of
Gettysburg. Now they enjoyed
its delights for the first time.
But this year the dinner was
put to the test by an elite group
of food critics. This group of thir¬

teen critics, posing as simple, col
lege students, infiltrated the Din- /
ing Center and secured a table. In _S
order to keep their identities secret, _^j
the critics had to wait on the line
stretching around the corner of the
Dining Center with the rest of the
student body. Needless to say they
were quite ravenous when they were
finally seated.
Upon sitting the critics immedi
ately started in on the vegetable platter
and bread sticks that were offered. One
member of the group, while eating a
roll, commented on the ingenious de
sign of the butter, which happened to
be turkey shaped. The fascinating de
sign soon disappeared, however, as the
butter was quickly spread on the deli
cious (and happily plentiful) rolls.
The atmosphere of the Dining

Center was festive and the group soon was delivered.
found themselves sharing in the happy The fare consisted of traditional
banter. The service was excellent as it Thanksgiving offerings: mashed pota
was provided by a host of the * toes, stuffing, gravy,

most of the restau- were quite
rants at which the critics have eaten. In small, unlimited quantities were avail
fact, several of the company had rated able. Again, the swiftness of the serv
lt above and beyond, considering the ers has to be applauded, for as soon as
hectic environment in which the service they arrived at the table, an empty plate

was quickly handed to them, with a curt
request (i.e., "More stuffing, please!").
The affair was billed as "family
style," since all the food was brought
to the tables on plates, to be divided up
there. And a family affair it was, with
people talking loudly at each other, with
much laughter all around. The experi
ence only helped to whet the critics'
appetites for another Thanksgiving
with their familes next week. The
Dining Center offered students the
chance to have Thanksgiving with
_^ _^ \ their other family—their school
family.
/ The critics are now very
/ curious to find out the sta
tistics on this year's dinner
^~ "" \ compare to last year's. Last

\ year, 1609 students were
. , j served 2288 pounds of tur
«& !/ key, 700 pounds of stuffing,
_^ 40 gallons of gravy, 945

SkBJiw vegetables, 180 pounds of
_JJF_^ cranberry jelly, 90 pounds ot
cheese spread, 2628 dinner
rolls and 1568 slices of pump
kin pie. The critics figure they
consumed at least half that
amount this year, so the num
bers should be astonishing.
At the end of the evening the

group s reaction was not only favorable
but wholeheartedly enthusiastic. They
did, however, find it difficult to move
quickly, many complaining of a sudden
tightening of their pants. The critics
have made it known that not only do
they highly recommend the food (giv
ing it five delicious turkeys out of a
possible five), but they also suggest tak
ing a nap.

Dear Libby,
Could we get rid of the
flies in the buildings? It
is unsanitary!! _*_-

Seri
ously
bothered Dear
Bothered,
This

question is
getting about as old
as the one about a snack bar
in the library. Don't you read
my column? Did you miss it

when I said Libby can not get
rid of the flies? Professor
McGlynn, who knows a lot
about flies, says they will die
when it gets cold. Well it is cold
and he's right. There
^^^^^ are fly swatters
¦^E_^_hL«/*-_^ at the circula¬

tion desk if
you want
to kill
off the
V f e w
remaining

cold resistant insects.
Libby,
Have more computers
available in the library (laptops

have checked out (View Your #
Own Record link) and put a*
hold on a book that is already,
checked out, right on the com- •

perhaps). Also, get more com
puters that work at least 75%
of the time.
(Unsigned message sent
from Terminal 800 in the li
brary at 3:29 p.m.)
Dear Terminal 800,
You must have found one
computer that worked to send
this message. Libby always sees
every seat in the lab filled with
people working happily, so she
checked with Mike Martys in
IR since she's not in charge of
computing and he is. He said,
"The lab machines do take a
pounding. But IR will fix any
computer that we notice is bro
ken. A lot of the time we don't
know, and no one reports the
problem. We'll hang up some
signs to encourage students to
report broken machines."
Dear Libby,

brary porch but it looks like it

Dear Jessica, *
Libby likes any idea that •

eluded this information in last
week 's column and can't under
stand why it was omitted.
(Editor's Note: This in
formation was omitted due to
lack of space. Any confusion
is regretted.)
Dear. Libby,
At my old school, we
could not only check the sta
tus of books checked out

cuts down on waste and your*
idea sounds like it might save *
the library money and the stu- *
dents time. But when I checked •
with the library's head of Ac- *
cess, Robin Moskal, she*
pointed out a few things that*
Libby didn't know—some*
problems that would be hard*
to get around. •

online, but could choose to re
new them well. Since
Gettysburg is such a comput
erized school, I thought I
would make this suggestion to
the library.
Thanks, Waltei J. Lee
Walter,
We think this is a great
idea and will and try and set it
up. Stay tuned. Students can
aheady «et a list of what they

First, interlibrary loan ,
articles are ordered for a par- *
ticular person and when the ar- ,
tides arrive they are given to*
that person to keep. So the h- *
- contuued on page 7 - *
see WASTE *

WASTE

brary has no control over get
ting those articles back. We
also agree when ordering some
thing on interhbrary loan that
it is for one person's use and
pay a copyright fee for one per
son, not multiple users.
If the library placed old
Reserves articles in a file cabi
net somewhere in the library
the articles would then become,
in effect, part of the library
collection. We usually don't
have to pay a copyright fee the
first time an article goes on re
serve (that's called "fair use")
but if articles in a filing cabinet

get continued use, and we have
not paid a royalty fee on each
of the articles, we would be in
violation of the law.
Trust Libby on this one.
The publishers would NOT be
happy if they found out and we
could be in serious legal
trouble. Your idea sounds great
at first glance, but we are stuck.
We wish you and your friends
would become copyright law
yers and help us figure a way
around some of the many re
strictions that drive Libby and
the librarians crazy trying to be
good, law-abiding citizens.

Who carries the condom?

by Robert Craft, Tara
Mahoney, Christina
Pappas, Anne Pryor
Contributing Writers
Imagine this scen?no: it
is a Saturday night and you
have been partying pretty hard.
A certain "somebody" catches
your eye from across the
sweaty dance floor. The two
of you begin dancing. Through
your beer goggles you can tell
it's going to be a "good night."
Rubbers, the pill, a dia
phragm—in whose hands does
the responsibility he?
On a college campus we
are confronted with the re
sponsibility of protecting our
selves from unwanted preg
nancy, and, of course, from
sexually transmitted diseases.

Herein lies the dispute. Tradi
tionally, a male carrying a con
dom has been seen as an "ag
gressor" with the sole intention
of having sex, and not neces
sarily as a responsible partici
pant in sex. Similarly, females
who take oral contraceptives
have been portrayed as partici
pants in casual sex, yet in real
ity, they are protecting them
selves against unwanted preg
nancies and also regulating
their menstrual cycles.
When any two willing
and mature adults are partici
pating in sexual intercourse,
both should be held responsible
in terms of protecting one an
other. This encompasses the
use, supply, and knowledge of
different types of contracep
tion. The age-old myth that
either the man or the woman

is more responsible for provid

ing protection is therefore
WRONG! All participants en
gaging in sex are accountable.
There are basically 'four
types of contraception: barrier
(the male/female condom, dia
phragm), hormonal (the pill,
Depo-Provera), surgical (steril
ization), and natural (the
rhythm method). Although
each has their specific advan
tages and disadvantages, the
challenge is finding the right
one for both of you. Perhaps
the most important factor in
your decision should be what
each protects against and what
it does NOT protect against.
Such factors influencing your
choice are access to services,
availability, cost, and your po
htical/cultural/ religious influ
ences. The choice is yours.
Please choose wisely...

What are you
thankful for
this year?

from the .feminist _Iront What's in a name? Sexism, for one

by Rachel Hanson
Columnist
After reading one of my
previous columns, an alumna
of Gettysburg College con
tacted me in the hopes that I
would be able to help her ac
complish something she has not
been able to do for nearly 20
years. It is my hope that I will
do just that by informing the
College community of her
story. Beginning in 1981,
Maggie Mudd began to ask the

been acknowledged and they
will address her as she wishes.
However, a mailing she re
ceived just two weeks ago was
addressed to "Dr. and Mrs.
Samuel A. Mudd."
To add insult to injury,
the College assumed that be
cause Mr. Mudd was still con
tributing to the College, they
could say that she also gave, just
so the percentage of alumni giv
ing would be higher. Ms.
Mudd has not donated in pro
test of the administration's re
fusal to grant her request, and
yet they still claim that she
does. It is amazing that the Col
lege refuses to comply with Ms.
Mudd's very reasonable, and
also simple, request. In not
doing this, the administration
is rendering Ms. Mudd invis
ible and making her contribu
tion to the College seem unim
portant and unwanted.

from alumni, those placing the
calls are told that if there are
two alumni who are living to
gether, they are to first ask for
the man.
This arrangement can be
taken to mean that the College
is willing to recognize a woman
as being separate from her hus
band when it is convenient for
them - when they want money.
However, they will not recog
nize the woman if there is a
man that they can talk with in
stead. When there is a man from

administration that all mailings
sent to her and her husband
(who is also an alumnus) be
addressed to "Samuel A. and
Margaret A. Mudd "57 _'62,"
rather than "Dr. and Mrs.
Samuel A. Mudd _*57 '62."
Ms. Mudd had stopped giving
money to the College and said
that she would not start again
until this was fixed.
For almost 20 years, Ms.
Mudd has received numerous
letters from the administration
saying that her request had

whom they can extract money,
the College cannot be bothered
with recognizing the woman as
being her own person and not
merely an extension of her hus
band. I find this situation to be
very troubling. I will readily
admit that the College's admin
istration has been willing to al
low feminist-oriented institu
tions such as the Women's
Studies program, the Women's
Center, and the Women's Con
ference to exist and be funded.
However, when the Col¬

lege refuses over and over
again, for at least 20 years, to
acknowledge the fact that their
female alumni are capable of
living and breathing on their
own, as well as making their
own decisions, and are not just
a part of their husbands, they
are rendering the years of work
by women, and particularly the
feminist movement, useless.
If women cannot gain re
spect and recognition as human
beings by their own alma mater,
how can women expect their
position elsewhere in society to
be any better?
It was so important to the
administration that they not
meet Ms. Mudd's request that
they were even willing to give
up one of the most important
things to this institution: the
almighty dollar.

Many people who are
against the feminist movement
would argue that the name by
which a person is addressed is
very trivial and they would
criticize this as being a concern
of a feminist. However, as I
said before, if the feminist

movement meets this much re
sistance in this "small" matter,
it just proves how difficult it is
for much larger feminist issues
to be taken seriously and see
any success.
My larger question (and
fear) here is how many other
women (alumni of both this
college and of other colleges)
are in the same position as Ms.
Mudd and also seeing no re
sponse? I believe that the num
bers are much larger than we
may think.
I hope that now that the
College community has been
made aware of these sexist
practices that are being carried
out by our own administration,
people will begin to realize just
how prevalent sexism is in our
society.

I also hope that those
who feel as angered and ap
palled by this as I do will con
tact me and hopefully we can
work together to have Maggie
Mudd, as well as countless
other women, finally recog
nized as a person by Gettysburg
CoHece.

This is not the only ex
ample of sexism that Ms. Mudd
has seen the College carry out.

A sad farewell to Buckley's

by la. lsherwood
Social Critic
Souls of Poets dead and gone,
What Elysium have ye known,
Happy field or ?nossy cavern,
Choicer than the Mermaid Tav :
em? -Keats
Wine conies in at the mouth
And love comes in at the eye;
That's all we shall know for
truth
Before we grow old and die.
I lift the glass to my mouth,
I look at you, and I sigh.
-W.B. Yeats (Drinking Song)
At the beginning of the
semester I wrote in this very
column that a local haunt of
mine and of many of my dear
est and closest friends was fac
ing extinction because of the
cold hard hand of greed. It is
with such great reservation that
I announce that Buckley's Irish

this Side oi Cunichm

Tavern will cease to exist come
closing time on Saturday night.
At that time the dear and
generous employees whom
many of us know at least by
face, if not by name, will pack
up the restaurant and bar and
bolt the doors shut. It is at this
time that a truly great cultural
and community center will be
forever lost, and by some, for
gotten.
I cannot express really
what this change will mean to
the many regular patrons and
families involved. It will mean
to most of us that a "home
away from home" will be
stripped and bastardized into
whatever type of trendy, cold
and moneymaking machine the
new owners wish it to be.
Some have said a cyber
bar, and others a family restau
rant (God knows Gettysburg
needs another one of those),
but whatever they choose,

Gettysburg's only little Irish
theme bar with all of its music,
laughter and good honest con
versation will no longer be.
What I am truly saying is
that a place where families con
gregate, where tourists learn
from living historians and
where Irish culture and music
is played and sung will be lost
to the hands of a corporation
who does not truly understand
the meaning of community.
This is the sad fate of so many
small businesses, and at the
same time, the sad fate of our
tiny little tavern.
I remember most well
those times when my band was
blessed to play within Buckley's
walls. I will never forget the
utter thrill that a tavern, which
seemed all too intimidating at
first, actually gave a chance to
three unprofessional so-called
musicians with a good name.
Still, the staff had some sort of

faith in our development as a
band and they kept booking us
for more and more dates until
we actually sounded decent.
We became a house band for
an ever-increasing family of
regulars who knew our songs
(and bad jokes) by heart.
This summer, I remember
just showing up and playing for
a good meal and a pint With my
roommate for hours, while the
crowd picked up percussion
and joined in our fun.
Buckley's became the place
where I went to talk, to read
and to feel like I was a part of
this community as a whole. It
is these memories that will lin
ger in my heart and it is all of
our memories that this commu
nity will cherish.
So for all of these good
times and for the one great
chance which the staff gave my
band and me as a person, I must
issue a thank you. In addition

I must thank the whole of our
tiny college community for
supporting our band over the
last few years here. We will not
disappear, but will keep on
with the Irish tinker tradition.
I hope sincerely that
those who took our tavern
never realize what it is that they
actually robbed all of us, and
future generations, of. I don't
see how any decent human be
ing could live with themselves
after such a careless and cold
(purely financial) decision.
This weekend will be last
for Buckley's. In addition, Fri
day night will be the last time
the Warrior Poets will play
there. Come out and show
your support for the bar, the
staff, and the Buckley's family
(if you are of age on the week
end nights). It is to them we
owe the memories. "So fill to
me the parting glass, goodnight
and joy be with you all."

Letters to the Editor

Advisory Committee must
heed student concerns
I applaud the Residential and So
cial Life Advisory Committee of Get
tysburg College. I commend its mem
bers, a group of students, faculty, ad
ministrators and trustees; for they have
doubtlessly devoted a great deal of time
and effort to implementing policies and
changes which they believe reflect the
concepts that the student body supports.
They have spent many months conduct
ing numerous studies, surveys, and fo
cus groups upon which to base their
ideas. These thirteen ambitious men and
women who set out to establish a new
"mission" statement over the past year
constructed several positive, beneficial
proposals for the enhancement of our
college community. A new recreation/
fitness center, better housing options for
upperclassmen, and an improved first
year experience...all of these proposals
sound outstanding.

So, Professors Riggs, Birkner, and
James; I applaud you. These ideas hold
the potential to strengthen and rejuve
nate student life. Now, as an indepen
dent sophomore student, I would like
to once again address the explosive is
sue of sophomore Rush - subjectively
instead of objectively this time.
To the well-meaning authors of
the editorial letter, "Students are unnec
essarily fixed on one aspect of trustees'
statement," I would sincerely ask you
to step back from the personal stake you
have invested in your committee's "mis
sion" and listen, really listen, to the
feedback it has drawn from the people
it will inevitably affect the most, the stu
dents. You lament that none of us re
sponded with enthusiasm to the policy
proposals I mentioned. We apologize
to you, the faculty members, adminis
trators, and residence life coordinators,

for our ungrateful attitudes.
But with all due respect, ladies and
gentlemen, you have literally pushed the
issue of sophomore Rush down our
throats without forewarning. This plan
WILL reshape Greek Life. If we, the
student population you govern, have
responded with urgency, it is simply
because we do not want to see the Greek
institutions to which we are all tied
threatened or affronted.
Your committee must have re
searched the issue with a very narrow
spectrum of student input; for no one,
and I mean no one, with whom I have
discussed the policy change has fully
agreed with the concept. In fact, some
freshmen say that if they were applying
to schools all over again and heard that
Gettysburg practiced sophomore Rush,
they wouldn't want to come here pe
riod. Let's face it, trustees, you've
stomped on a hornet's nest, and now
the hornets are mad. From here on out
it's just a matter of saving face.

You "hope that the Greek students
on campus will quickly change their
mode of thinking" about the redefin
ing of Rush. That, to be frank, just ain't
gonna happen until you provide con
crete evidence to prove that your pro
posals will not jeopardize Gettysburg's
Greeks. To tell you the truth, we really
don't care if you "believe that the ulti
mate impact of sophomore Rush on this
campus will be positive." We want to
know for sure.
Just because this policy has been
carried out on other campuses does
NOT mean it will work on ours. We
aren't Dickinson, nor any other college
whose system you want to model ours
after. We are Gettysburg, folks, and we
don't want sophomore Rush unless you
can say with 100% certainty that no
negative impact will occur as a result.

eastern United States.
At college we worry about where to drink
on Friday nights, how to catch up on sleep,
and how to finish that 20-page paper we
should have started weeks ago. For college
students, these are all genuine concerns, but
placed in a global perspective, our concerns
are relatively minor.
As a very wise high school history
teacher once said, "there are three billion
people in China who don't even know you
have an exam today, and if they did they
wouldn't care."
Gettysburg is thought by some to be in
a bubble, isolated from "real-world" issues
and concerns. Whether or not this is true,
none of the students here have to worry about
where their next meal will come from, or
where they will live after the forces of nature
destroy their only home.

Crazy as it sounds, we should be thank
ful for papers, projects, late night study ses
sions, even nights of only three hours of
sleep. Compared to all the problems that
can befall a person, most of us are in pretty
good shape.

Open I'ifcs Open Ears
Civility or snobbery: the choice is up
to us

by Rick Deulsch
COLUMNLSl
No one has been attacked
by townies in the last few
weeks, so maybe these kids are
getting the point and realizing
that jumping college students is
unacceptable...right? Think
again. I hate to beat a dead
horse here, but I think it would
be dangerous to assume that
this problem has gone away
simply because there have been
no incidents recently.
I have a tendency to clas
sify certain situations as
"unresolvable" based on their
unwillingness to present a so
lution, but I am not yet willing
to do so here. In fact, it is the
very poignant differences be
tween the two groups in this
battle that have the potential to
yield a viable solution.

If the college students act
towards the local youths as they
do towards each other, there is
bound to be hostility. An un
derstanding of a different type

of youth on the part of the col
lege students is absolutely es
sential in budging the gaping
hole between the two groups.
College kids here are
from predominantly middle
and upper class areas, are used
to getting what they want, and
generally carry an air of supe
riority when they enter the
town. If that doesn't apply to
you, it probably does to one of
your friends. The locals, on the
other hand, aren't kids from a
particularly wealthy area who
may or may not get what they
want, and they could very eas
ily take offense to what they
perceive as individual acts of
snobbery.
I rm not condoning the
behavior of the local youths
who jump college students at
the first sign of aggression and
without warrant. _Ftom what I
know of the recent incidents,
it seems quite clear that the lo
cals in each case acted lnatio
nally.

But it is essential to re
member that the local youths

are not the oddities of this
town, the college students are.
A fellow Opinion columnist
touched on this, point earlier
this year when he noted the
raucous bar behavior of the stu
dents. While I don't feel that
it's particularly harmful to be
rowdy _mstde the bars, I can
only take the side of the resi
dents of Gettysburg who com
plain of students throwing
trash on their yards and urinat
ing on their cars.
The choice to conform to
the basic standards of neigh
borly behavior that have been
established in Gettysburg is
entirely up to the individual.
However, being temporary
residents does not exempt us
from acting civilly, nor is it a
viable excuse.

We have a strike against
us in that we are already seen
as snobby, upperclass kids, but
again, it is our choice to either
confirm or refute that suspi
cion. It would be easier to con
firm it, but that really won't get
us anywheic.will it?

Student Concerns

I've heard from many stu
dents that sophomore Rush was
suggested by the administration
once before here, and that the
students saw through the flimsy
reasoning behind it and
shouted it down. We, too, are
cognizant enough to see what
is really going on in this "mis
sion" of yours.
Over half of the Sopho
more Leaders are Greek. Yet
your committee feels that
sophomores aren't prepared
for the rigors of leadership
roles within the Greek system.
What does that say about
the faith you have in our abili
ties as competent college-edu
cated adults? Are you telling
us that 18 and 19-year-olds are
just too stupid to make in
formed choices? i genuinely
hope not!
I am angry, and I'm not

- continued from page 11
even a member of the Greek
community. I'll tell you why -
your charactet judgement of
my peers tells me that you don't
think we're responsible or in
telligent enough to manage our
own social and academic lives.
Perhaps the "intrusion of
Rush and pledging" will, as
"many students claim, interfere
with their ability to do their
best work." I'm all for excel
ling academically. But students
must be allowed to govern their
own balance between classes
and extracurricular endeavors.
We are not children. We
can shape our own positive
residential and social experi
ences without the guiding hand
of Big Brother telling us we're
not quite mature enough to
take control of our college ex¬

perience.
Ask your constituents

what they want, and they'll tell
you. Force feed them new rules
that the majority didn't ask for,
and by God they'll tell you even
faster. I apologize, trustees, for
I am not trying to belittle your
committee or its efforts. Oh, I
applaud you. But on the issue
of sophomore Rush, I advise
you to take a cue from the
people that matter—the people
paying your salaries by coming
here—before you have a rebel
lion on your hands. Because
the students of Gettysburg Col
lege are not puppets, and I dare
say that no one who cares one
bit for the Greek system and for
their own personal freedoms
will take your so-called "mis
sion" sitting down.
Sincerely,

_^Presidential candidates living la vida loca

by Christina Dickert
Political Columnist
For months now, presi
dential candidates have been
trying to make themselves ap
pealing to certain groups of
voters. Mainly, the female vote
and the African-American vote
have been the principle targets
of presidential persuasion, but
in Iowa, where the nation's first
caucus will be held on January
24, 2000, a new audience has
been focused on by the candi
dates. Both Republican and
Democratic candidates have
been addressing the growing
Latino population in Iowa,
hoping that the Latino vote
would help them in the Iowa
polls.

The Latino population in
Iowa has grown about 75% in
the past eight years, but it still
comprises only 2% of the total
resident population. Presiden
tial candidates have had their
ads and brochures translated
into Spanish so they could

reach a greater amount of
Latino voters. George W Bush
announced the release of a ra
dio ad in Spanish that was sup
posedly being broadcast on ra
dio stations that held a major
ity of Latino listeners, but in the

past two weeks, it
hasn't been heard at V
any of the radio sta- %
tions across Iowa. %
This is not good _^_%
publicity for Bush, _J_^
who has been ex- /^^^H
cited about saying ^^^^
such catch phrases as _*
"the beginning of a new
day for Latinos" and introduc
ing his Hispanic steering com
mittee in Iowa. Many Bush
supporters point to his popu
larity with LaUno voters in
Texas, assuming that this phe
nomenon will spill over into his
presidential campaign. But
other Latinos are thinking dif
ferently.
- Many Latinos feel as
though they are being wooed
by both Bush and Gore. Both
politicians' official websites
contain a link to a page in Span¬

ish. Both candidates have been
known to include Spanish
words and phrases in their
speeches to the Latino commu
nity. The candidates believe
that they are going to win the
Latino vote by showing that
. they know a few Spanish

words and have their
publicity translated into
Spanish. But many
_^. Latinos want

to hear the candidates' policy to
wards the Latino community.
The Latino community would
like to hear issues like immigra
tion and others that relate di
rectly to them addressed sen
onslv in the candidates'

speeches. They demand the
same lespect and consideration
that other voting groups re
ceive from the candidates.
They don't want an "hola" -
they want to hear the nitty
gritty policy suggestions that
are going to affect them.
Al Gore seems to be lead¬

ing in the race for Latino sup
port. In September,Gore re
ceived endoisements from over
five hundred Hispanic elected
officials and community
leadeis, including a num
^ bei from Bush's home
_^_A state of Texas. He also
V \ has gained the support
W \ of the Congressional
k \ Hispanic Caucus.
I V Many Latinos
I m have become wary of
L the Republican

agenda and how it
would affect them_,
has gained support from

Goie the fact that Latinos tend to
vote Democratic, as well as the
endorsements from the na
tional Latino community.
Geoige W Bush may be
savvy in addressing the Latino

community thiough speeches,
radio ads (that are supposed to
appear in Iowa sometime this
week), and Spanish language
pamphlets, but Al Gore has ac
tual proof that he is a promoter
of Latino rights. As Vice Presi
dent, Gore assisted Hispanics
through the Earned Income
Tax Credit. As a candidate he
has revealed a plan to help
struggling Latino businesses
nationwide by making $25 bil
lion in loans available to them
through the Small Business Ad
ministration.

And, to make this all pos
sible and to keep the Latino
community on the road to the
so-called "American Dream,"
Gore has advocated the cre
ation of a Hispanic education
plan, which would provide
money tor moie Latinos to at
tend college. Gore has ap
pealed to Latino voters
through his actions, not
through his rhetoric. That is
the way to appeal to the Latino
community - with proof, not
empty promises. And Al Gore
has done lust that.

Incoming _Zhouqhts On a windy Nouember night

by jeph mcgowan
Columnist
My uncle sat me down
once when I was a kid and tried
to teach me the importance of
masonry and construction. He
told me the most important
thing, so imperative, was to
have a firm foundation to lay
anything on. Whether a build
ing or a patio, the bottom layer
has to be firm and well con
structed or everything built on
top will fall right over.
I thought about and al
most discarded this useful tid
bit of information, until one
day the shed in the backyard

fell down. It got me thinking,
and then I realized that, like
neatly eveiy other piece of in
formation, the little lesson over
a decade ago meant something
a little more than was intended.
There's nothing much
that tops a chilly wintry
evening, there's nothing pret
tier than new fallen snow on a
clear, freezing, starlit winter's
night. Through a window, that
is. There's nothing worse than
waiting all day for a rousing
rendition of Servo Thanksgiv
ing and then having to wait out
side watching people inside
chowing down on your turkey.
Through a'Window, that is.
Where they have the jacket you

need because you left youts on
the floor m your loom. It'sa
grueling woild sometimes.
Then you eat too much, and it's
all the more giuehng.
The whole plan of wrap
ping gifts is really losing its lus
tei with me. Not only am I the
woild's woist wrapper, but it
got me thinking about antici
pation. Sometimes anticipation
is a bad thing, like when I had
to wait two months while I
saved enough money to buy my
Nintendo when I was a kid, or
like on Christmas Eve when I
know for a fact I got what I
asked for and I'm still awake
at three m the morning. Some
times, though it seems bad, all

the waiting may be a good
thing. It gives you time to le
ah/e and appieciate what you
|iist might be getting. If you
got evei ythmg sei ved to you on
a silvei plattei and never had
to woik foi anything (like my
aunt's wiap-jobs) you'd surely
not caie as much. When 1 was
little 1 got lots of models and
Legos, and it's a lot like that.
You have to build the thing be
fore you really have it, some
times there aie no instiuctions
oi not enough pieces; you just
have to improvise and caie
enough about the project to
stick with it and get it done
light. Aftei all that woik, the
finished pioduct is definitely

worth it.
One word in this sen
tence is wrong. Think about
everything that's happened to
you and everyone else around
you, every little event, however
minuscule, that has had some
type of impact on you. Just
think, each and eveiy one of
those has culminated in this
particular moment; change one
thing or one occurrence and
you might change everything.
Who would you be? A million
aire in Bel An ? Somewhere in
Pans? Alone in the dark with
out a flashlight? Whete's your
flashlight? Mine's on the desk
right here, a special little dream
that still has to be built.







Bullets suffer disappointing loss in season close up
Smith finishes career with a pair of all-time seconds

from Staff Reports
From Gettysburg Times

Presswire
Matt McCall and Chuck
Richards each rushed for more
than 100 yards and combined
for three touchdowns to lead
Franklin & Marshall over Get
tysburg, 22-12, in Centennial
Conference action on Saturday.
With the loss, the Bullets
wrapped up their 1999 season
with a 3-7 record (2-5 Centen
nial Conference).
Daryl Black added a ca
reer-high 79 rushing yards for
the Diplomats (1-8, 2-5 Cen
tennial Conference), who ex
tended Gettysburg's winless
streak at Sponaugle-Wilhamson
Field to nine games. The Bul
lets are 0-8-1 in Lancaster since
a victory in 1982.

Gettysburg fullback Paul
Smith carried 22 times for 48
yards to finish his collegiate
career in second place on the
conference's all-time rushing
list with 5,205 yards. Former
Western Maryland running
back Eric Frees (1988-91)
holds the record of 5,281.
Smith amassed 202 all
purpose yards on the afternoon
- including a fouryard touch
down reception - to finish sec
ond on the NCAA's all-time
career all-purpose yards list
with 9,104. Only Brian Shay of
Division II Empona (Kan.)
State compiled more all-pur
pose yards in a collegiate career
(9,301 from 1995-98).
In addition, Smith set a
program record for single-sea
son rushing yards, finishing the

campaign with 1,546 and
breaking the mark of 1,515 he
established last season.
Gettysburg's Dennis
Flaherty completed 14 of 31
passes for 237 yards and two
touchdowns against F&M, in
cluding a 75-yard second-quar
ter scoring pass to Bryan
Pojanowski.
Richards finished the day
with a career-high 114 yards
for F&M, and McCall added
103 yards to become the first
and only two 100-yard rushers
for the Diplomats this season.
F&M rolled up 315 rushing

yards on the afternoon against
only 80 for Gettysburg.
Trailing 12-7, Franklin &C
Marshall put together a 14
play, 70-yard scoring drive late
in the first half to take the lead
for good.
After a 14-yard pass from
McCall to Andy Gilburg and an
eight-yard run on third down
by Richards moved the ball to
the Gettysburg 5, McCall scam
pered into the end zone to give
the Diplomats a 13-12 lead
with 2:30 left before halftime.
McCall then hit Gilburg
on a two-point conversion to

cap the seven-minute drive and
give Franklin &c Marshall a 15
12 advantage.
Following a scoreless
third quarter, the Diplomats
stretched their lead with a
touchdown early in the fourth
quarter.
Richards capped the 12
play, 66-yard drive with a five
yard TD run to give the Dip
lomats a 22-12 advantage with
12:00 remaining in the game.
The Bullets had a golden
opportunity to cut into the
Franklin & Marshall lead with
a fake field goal attempt on

their next possession. The pass
from Weston Wells to a wide
open Matt Helwig at the
Franklin &c Marshall 2 was
ruled out of bounds, however,
allowing the Diplomats to take
over at their own 20 with 9:28
remaining.
The Bullets could not
score on either of their final
two possessions, both times
turning the ball over on downs.
Gettysburg took a 6-0
lead on its second possession of
the afternoon when Flaherty
connected with Smith on a
four-yard touchdown pass to
cap a ten-play, 49-yard drive
with nearly eight minutes gone
in the game.
Franklin &C Marshall an
swered by marching 65 yards
on eight plays to take a 7-6 lead
with 13:49 left in the second
quarter. McCall finished off the
drive with a one-yard touch
down plunge.

With 8:19 left before
halftime, Flaherty put the Bul
lets back on top with a 75-yard
touchdown pass to Pojanowski,
who broke a tackle at the
Franklin &c Marshall 25 to fin
ish off the run and give Gettys
burg a 12-7 lead.
Cliff Mason led the Bul
let defense with career-high 13
total tackles and intercepted a
McCall pass. Ryan Moore, the
team's leading hitter, added 12
tackles and recovered two
fumbles. Moore finished the
season with 133 tackles, the
most by a Bullet during this
decade.
Gettysburg finished 3-7
for the second consecutive sea
son.

Mens' Soccer lets one slip away in first NCAA game
Bullets finish terrific season 15-2-2 overall, 8-0-1 in Centennial Conference

by Robin Ror_._tR
Staff Writer
The long ride has come
to an end. The Bullets have
said their last goodbyes to a
very successful, memorable sea
son. They have a lot ot accom
plishments to look back on, and
cannot deny that they have left
a big season to follow.
Thanks to their depth,
Gettysburg just might have a
repeat performance next year.
However, they take a big hit
with the loss of seniors Jason
Vishio, Chris Pryor, Jesse

Flynn, and Adam Outerbndge.
Together, they broke two
school records, and one confer
ence record. Vishio broke the
school and conference record
for assists in a single season,
with 17. Along with his 17 as
sists, he managed to net eight
goals of his own.
Pryor broke the Gettys
burg College career goal record
with 50, placing himself in se
lective company. Only four
other players reached this mark
in conference history. He also
managed to add six assists
throughout the season.

Flynn can boast five goals
and five assists, besides setting
up many of the plays and dis
tributing from the midfield.
Outerbridge contributed with
eight goals and five assists.
More than half of the seniors
received Centennial Confer
ence Player of the Week recog
nition.
Unfortunately, the season

ended abruptly, with a 2-1 loss
to defending national cham
pion Ohio Wesleyan, last Fri¬

day. Many fans came out to
support the Bullets at Messiah
under the lights. The players
felt the energy and came out

strong.
However, keeper Nick La
Porta said, "After the first J5
minutes we got flat." Ohio
Wesleyan players scored two

first half goals, before Gettys
burg could retaliate.
They came back much
stronger in the second half, and
scored their only goal. Sopho¬

more Mike McLaughhn ripped
one fiom 30-40 yards out and
the keeper had no chance. It
was as if it were in slow mo- '
tion. The Bullets' opposition

could see it coming, but there
was nothing anyone could do
about it.
Following McLaughhn's
goal, Gettysburg rallied and
generated many more scoring
opportunities. One could hear
the audience collectively hold
ing their breath with each shot
hred. The Bullets dominated
the second half of the contest.
"I think we tired them out,"
said McLaughhn. "If we had
five more minutes, we probably
would have scored again."

The Bullets' endurance
may have had something to do
with their impressive perfor
mance towards the end of the
game. La Porta attributed their
performance to another factor.
" They were good, but we were
better," he said.
Although anyone who
was at the game could see this,
the score board did not reflect
it, as the team posted their first
loss since September 4. The
game was a close one and a
heartbreaker, but the Bullets
put out a valiant effort.

Hopefully the team will
have another shot at the NCAA
championships next year. The
team has a bright future with
many freshmen, and many key
returning players. Perhaps one
of the freshmen this year will
eventually break Pryor's or
Vishio's records. As for upper
classmen, there is a strong sup
porting cast waiting to take the
lead. So, this season ended on
a bittersweet note. No one
wants to end on a loss. How
ever, the Bullets have plenty
accomplishments, of which
they can be proud. And now
they can devote time to other
pursuits, like . . . work?

Cross Country teams place in top ten at NCAA Regionals

Sophomore Kristin Roberts and Junior Jonathan Catlett named to All-Mideast Regional Team

by Jeff Cumpson
Staff Writ er
On yet another unseason
ably warm fall afternoon, the
Gettysburg College men's and
women's cross country teams
took to the course at Fort
Frederick State Park in Big
Pool, Maryland with a chance
to add a few more accomplish
ments to their already impres
sive resumes.

Both team and individual
accomplishments were at stake,
as the top two teams at the
NCAA Mideast Regional ad
vanced to the NCAA National
Championship in Oshkosh,
Wisconsin.
In addition, the top four
runners not included-on those
teams also advance to the Na
tional race. This was the race
that both the men and women
had been working for all sea
son.

Unfortunately for them,
on a day that can only be char
acterized as "disappointing" by
men's senior co-captain David
Gary, both Bullet teams failed
to produce either a top two fin
ish in the team standings, or a
runner with the necessary plac
ing, as Gettysburg closed out its
1999 campaign.
Kristin Roberts' 7th place
finish was as close as Gettys
burg got to sending a runner to
Oshkosh, as the sophomore
again paced the women with a
time of 19:03.10. Roberts'
performance was good enough
to name her to the All-Mideast
Regional team.
Another sophomore,
Megan McGolnck, finished
second for the women with a
50th place finish (20:23.30).

Junior Kim Heimerl was
next for the Bullets, taking 67th
place with a time of 20:36.30.
Lauren Davis, a sopho
more, and Kelley Lord, a jun
ior, rounded out the top five for
the women as their times of
20_;52.30 and 21:07.50 were
good for 80th and 92nd place,
respectively.
As a team, Gettysburg
made good on Roberts' predic
tion, finishing in the top ten
and showing improvement
over last year's finish.

The men also finished in
the top ten, at tenth, but their
race was especially notable for
a return to form by junior
Jonathon Catlett.
After spending the major
ity of the season fighting injury
and illness, Catlett came back
strong in the final race of the
year, finishing 34th. His time
of 27:08.30 was good enough
to place him on the All-Region
team along with Roberts.
However, the team's perfor
mance marred any real sense ot

Volleyball advances to second round of
NCAA's before falling to Muskingum

The Gettysburg Bullet volleyball
team competed in the first round of the
NCAA tournament last Thursday at
Muskingum College in Ohio, and de
feated Alfred University 3-0. Success
came easily to the Bullets in all three
games.
The Bullets went into the tourna
ment very prepared, and it showed in
their playing. "We played very well that
day," said Head Coach Kim Kelly. "We
looked very strong and very steady."
Senior Catherine Schott and jun
ior Lisa Kamin each put down 12 kills
in the match, and sophomore Christina
Giles had seven. The Bullets' offense
hit .392 in this match, its fourth-best
hitting percentage in 35 matches this

season.
Junior Nicole Evans led the Bul
lets with 30 assists. Sophomore Megan
Wargo and first-year Lauren Boyd
helped the defense with 10 and six digs,
respectively.
Gettysburg controlled the pace of
the games throughout the match. "We
played like we belonged there," said
Giles. In the first game, the Bullets led
3-1 when they began a three point run

prompting a timeout called by Alfred.
This did not stop the Bullets, however,
as they continued on another run, this
time for six points.
With the score 11-1, Alfred called
their second timeout of the game. The
Bullets ended the first game with a kill
from Wargo and junior Mary Guay's
service ace, 15-1.

The Bullets continued to domi
nate the match through the second and
third games, winning them 15-4 and 15
5. With the win against Alfred Uni
versity, the Bullets advanced to play in
the Great Lakes Regional semifinals on
Friday. The Bullets faced Muskingum
College in this match, whom they had
lost to 0-3 in early October at the
Wittenberg Invitational.
The Bullets lost again to
Muskingum, 0-3, in the second round.
Evans led the Bullets in assists once
again with 25, while Schott contributed
10 kills and Wargo had 14 digs.
Despite their best efforts, the Bul¬

lets lost with scores of 15-1, 15-7, and
15-8. "It wasn't that we weren't pre
pared," said Kelly. "They are a much
bigger team than we are."
Muskingum is a very strong hit
ting and blocking team. For this rea
son, Gettysburg's had to concentrate
much of their efforts on defense and
could not pull together their usual of
fensive strength. With the loss, the
Bullets ended their 1999 season. Their
record stands at 21-15 overall, and they
hold their part of the Centennial Con
ference title.
Highlights of this season include
various team members being named to

the all-Centennial Conference Volley
ball teams.
Schott was honored with her third
consecutive Centennial Conference
Player of the Year award. The vote
among the conference's head coaches
was unanimous for the second year in a
row. Schott led the conference in hit
ting this year with .424 hitting percent
age, and an average of 4.88 kills per
game. In addition, Schott is the first
player to be named to the first-team All
Centennial Conference four years in a
row. Evans, who led the conference
with 10.96 assists per game, was also
named to the first-team.
Also recognized by the Centennial
Conference this season are Kamin, who
was named to the second-team, and
Wargo, who received honorable men
