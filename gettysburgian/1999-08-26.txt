Confusion conquered

by Cara Masucci
Staff Writer
So it's your first week at
Gettysburg. Are you unsure of
whereyour classes are going to be, what
placement tests you have to take, or
even what

your first ex
perience in the
dining hall is
going to be
like? That's
where Orien
tation is going
to come into
play. "These
are the days to
get to know
the campus
and commu
nity," said
Christine S e d 1 a c k o ,
chairwomen
of the Orienta
tion Commit
tee. "These are
also the days
to make new
friends, live in
a new environ
ment, take
new classes,

and work towards new goals." Orien
tation is set up for new students to ac
quaint themselves with the campus
through the academic, extracurricular,
and social spectrum before the hustle
and bustle of the year begins. Dean of
First Year Students, Robert Norvall,
commented, "This is a place where you
should be involved from day one and
should get on the ball academically -
you can do both." (See Story Page #)
There will be people on campus
all weekend long to help work through
some of the first glitches. From hook
ing up computers to the campus net
work to learning what it is like to be a
Gettysburg student, orientation is filled
with hints on how to successfully ad
just to Gettysburg. Throughout the
week new students will attend discus
sions on how to take full advantage of

the library resoutces, what the social
nouns are at Gettysburg, how to get in
volved in campus activities, and learn
about the academic Honor Code which
Gettysburg uses.
Many of the departments will also
hold open houses on Saturday where stu
dents who have questions pertaining to

academic matters can receive answers
and get acquainted with the faculty and
learn more about individual depart
ments.
Sedlacko commented, "The atmo
sphere will be casual and a lot of the pro
fessors will be on hand to talk to
students."Some students might even be
at the open houses to offer a student per
spective.
The Orientation Committee also
has a scavenger hunt planned. "It's a time
to learn about the campus and the com
munity in a fun way," said Sedlacko.
"There will also be some prizes avail
able to the top finishing orientation
groups that work together to solve all
the clues." This is a good time to learn
where some of the buildings are located,
what history the campus buildings hold,
and what campus resources are available

to students.
Orientation also has its fill of
other entertainment. Friday
afternoon, while some students
will be participating in Gettysburg is
Volunteering Day (GIV Day), others can
play sand volleyball. Later that evening
Steve Wiley, a 1973 Graduate of

Gettysburg College, will
speak to the
incoming
class.
Sedlacko
' ¦o minented
that Wiley is
one of the
premier mnti
v _, u i o n a I
speakers in
the nation.
What's even
better is that
he will be able
to relate ro
students just
starting out at
Gett) sburg
and let them
know what
pitfalls to
avoid. Atter
Wiley's talk,
new students
can listen to
the group

Imam in the Junction and experiment
with temporaly tatoos and Sand Art.
Saturday, Comedian David J will
make his third appearance at the Col
lege. His humor includes a lot of mate
rial on what it is like to be a Gettysburg
College student, and the excitement that
a lot of students feel when they learn
Walmart is open 24 hours a day!
Sunday, after registration, Orien
tation Weekend will conclude with a
banquet in which orientation leaders
will help serve the first year students
and transfers. After dinner, the Student
Activities Council (SAC) will be spon
soring Hypnotist Frank Santos for a
good yet mesmorizing time.
Take advantage of orientation be
cause as Sedlacko comments, "Your days
here will turn into months, then years,
and trust me, they will fly by."

College prepares with increased housing

From GCPR
Gettysburg College opens
its doors to an expected 680
first-year students on August
26, when students begin their
four-day orientation. Many
will perform community ser
vice at various locations
throughout the community
during the College's annual
GIV (Gettysburg Is Volunteer
ing) Day on August 27.
Upperclass students arrive on
August 29, and classes begin
Monday, August 30.
The Class of 2003 is the
largest in the College's history.
College officials planned for
620 to 630 first-year students
this fall, but expect to see an
increase of about 50 more stu
dents. Gettysburg's situation
follows a nationwide trend of
increased enrollments at selec
tive colleges and universities
around the country.

Like many other colleges
and universities, Gettysburg
did not experience the tradi
tional "summer melt" of stu
dents who pay deposits but
withdraw over the summer
months to attend other institu
tions. This phenomena was
cited in a June 12 New York
Times article, which noted "a
growing belief that college is
necessary for success has raised
the stakes for acceptance to the
nation's better colleges." This
year's enrollment growth was
not part of the College's long
range plan, but rather part of
this national trend.
In addition to the trend
of increased enrollment at the
top colleges and universities,
Gettysburg has remained at
tractive to prospective students
and their families because of its
distinctive academic programs
and location.

Last year, Gettysburg was
ranked eighth most wired col
lege by Yahoo! Internet Life
and was ranked number three
for great food by the 1999
Princeton Review's Best 311
Colleges.
To accommodate the ad
ditional students expected to
enroll at Gettysburg this fall,
the College has leased the Co
lonial Motel on Carlisle Street
and intends to purchase the
Appleford Inn, currently a bed
and-breakfast on Carlisle
Street. Purchase of the
Appleford is contingent on the

College receiving a zoning ex
ception and approval by its
own board of trustees.
About 56 upperclass
(sophomores, juniors and se
niors) students will reside in the
Colonial, and 21-25 will be
housed in the Appleford Inn.
Residence advisers from the
College will reside in and su
pervise these facilities, and se¬

curity, trash removal and park
ing will be provided to student
occupants.
In addition, the
Colonial's front office staff will
remain at the facility to assist
the College with staffing needs.
The Appleford Inn will
remain on the Borough of
Gettysburg's tax roll, as have
other properties acquired by

the College in the past de
cade. (Current annual taxes
for the Appleford are
$8721.) The Appleford will
likely be used in the future
as a special-interest house.
Gettysburg College has
undertaken similar projects
for student housing in the re
cent past. In 1991, the Col
lege received from Renee and

Kermit Paxton the former
Travel Lodge, currently known
as Paxton Hall, which today
houses more than 60 students.
The College recently spent
more than $150,000 on im
provements in landscaping,
outdoor seating, and lighting
for the building, which is stra
tegically located at a major
campus and borough intersec¬

tion. Quarry Suites Residence
Hall Complex, which is cur
rently being built at the end of
West Lincoln Avenue, is well
underway and expected to
open its doors to nearly 200
students in January 2000. Stu
dents currently living in other
College housing will be shifted
over to this new facility.
First-year students at
Gettysburg will be housed in
one of six residence halls on the
main campus. They will moved
into residence halls during the
morning of Thursday, August
26. Following an opening con
vocation at 3:30 p.m., parents
will depart and students will
begin the orientation process,
which involves meetings, place
ment exams, discussions and
social activities. Orientation

activities conclude on Sunday,
when all students register for
classes.

Class of 2003 enters record
books as biggest class ever

to expand each year.
The class of 2003 is a di
verse group, encompassing stu
dents from 32 states, the Dis
trict of Columbia, and Puerto
Rico, as well as 14 foreign
countries. The highest group
of first-years hails from Penn
sylvania, 202 new students, fol
lowed by New Jersey with 131,
New York with 79, Maryland
with 67, Connecticut with 63,
and Massachusetts with 40.
Other states represented in
clude Virginia, Delaware,
Maine, California, and New
Hampshire. This breakdown is
similar to other years.
Gettysburg is excited to
extend a welcome to twenty
new students of many nation
alities. They have travelled
from such far places as
Bangladesh, Brazil, Cyprus, El
Salvador, England, Ethiopia,

This week Gettysburg
College welcomes its largest
class ever as incoming first year
and transfer students move on
campus for orientation. A stag
gering 690 students from all
over the__ world will settle into
the 'Burg Thursday, August 26,
for the start of their ventures
in college life.
This class, including 673
new students as well as 17
transfers, sets a new record in
size, beating the class of 2001 's
644 new students. Fortunately
new housing is currently under
way; the construction of the
Quarry Suites will ease space
dilemmas as the Gettysburg
College community continues

India, the Ivory Coast, Japan,
Korea, Peru, Romania, Switzer
land, and Thailand to join
Gettysburg's class of 2003.
It is always interesting to
note the most popular and
unique names on campus, and
this year's group of students
certainly includes a variety.
From Aaron, Abigail, and Akul
to Yuko and Zachary and ev
erything in between, there are
a total of 322 different first
names among first-years.
The most popular name
for girls in the class of 2003 as
well as for the total student
body is Jennifer, with 17 new
comers and a total of 49 alto
gether. Jennifer narrowly
ousted last year's favorite, Sara,
which is this year's runner-up
with 15 first-years for a total
of 38. Other favorites are Jes
sica, Lauren, Katherine, Eliza¬

beth, and Megan.
For men, the number one
name of the class of 2003 is
Michael (with 27), for a total
of 52 campus-wide. This con
quers last year's favorite, Josh,
by 12. The runner up is
Michael (with 17), and close
followers are Christopher,
Brian, Justin, John, Joseph,
Thomas, Benjamin, and David.
The overall favorite guy's name
is Michael, with an overall to
tal of 55.
As always, it will be in
teresting to see where the next
four years takes the incoming
class of 2003. Gettysburg will
ultimately shape each one of
them and open many doors of
great possibility for them.
From all of us at Gettysburg we
wish to you, the class of 2003,
the best experience of your
lives!

Do something dramatic this year

From Theater Department
In a fast-paced, energetic
performance layered with mul
timedia computer graphics and
sound, Rand Whipple delivers
a fast, funny and intellectual
viewpoint which can only be
described as "Stan Laurel meets
operant conditioning."
Whipple will bring his Pavlov's
Clown to the Kline Theatre on
Saturday, September 4 at 8:00

p.m. Tickets for Pavlov's
Clown are free and can be re
served by visiting the Kline
Theatre office (337-6060) or
the table in the CUB between
Il:00andl:00theweekofthe
show. Blending shadow pup
petry, comic dance, improvisa
tion and mime with six com
puter controlled screens, nine
robotics chips and nearly 200
computer images, Pavlov's
Clown keeps up with the cur
rent pace of life, while still pay
ing homage to its vaudevilhan
roots. The main character goes
through numerous short
sketches, culminating in the fi
nal scene "The Meaning of

Life," during which the clown
has to switch from ballet to
waltz to tango to rock and roll,
and so on, all in an effort to
keep up with change.
Rand Whipple's nearly
20 years of professional theatre
has made him known for his
highly physical performance
style, including dance, mime
and improvisation. His work
as a movement artist has taken
him to eleven different coun
tries, spanning four continents.
In 1988, Whipple became
one of the first recipients of the
Individual Artistic Develop
ment Grant from the Pennsyl
vania Council on the Arts, and
in 1996, he again received a
grant from the PCA to further
develop the use of computer
graphics and interactive tech
nology into theatre.

Pavlov's Clown is pre
sented by the Adams County
Arts Council in partnership
with the Performing Arts Com
mittee and Department of The
atre Arts of Gettysburg College.
This program is also supported
by a grant from the Common
wealth of Pennsylvania Coun
cil on the Arts, a state agency

supported by the National En
dowment for the Arts.
WHIPPED CREAM,
CHOCOLATE SYRUP, AND
RIPE, RED CHERRIES...
All first year students in
terested in theatre (in even the

smallest possible way) are in
vited to attend an ice cream
social at the Theatre House,
located at 239 Carlisle St. The
social runs from 6:00 until
8:00 PM on Friday, August 27.
Should the demand for ice
cream continue past the sched
uled time, further exotic foods

may be served (i.e. more ice
cream) and the social will con
tinue indefinitely. So come on
down and get to know the nice
folks in the Theatre House.
AUDITIONS
Auditions will be held
Monday and Tuesday, August
30 and 31, for any student in
terested in trying out for the
Theatre Department's fall
show, Heartbreak House. Stu
dents should stop by the Green
Room (on the bottom floor of
the Kline Theatre) between
3:30 and 6:00 PM on either of
those days. Director George
Muschamp will conduct the
auditions.

Success - Getting Involved Inside and Outside the
Classroom

From GCPR
When students first
come to college, the number of
possible activities to join is
overwhelming. In addition,
there is the academic challenge
of college courses. Dean of
First Year Students, Robert
Nordvall, recommends that
students take their time review
ing the options available and
deciding the activities in which
they want to participate at
Gettysburg, but he notes that
first year students should be
come involved in the life of the

College. A leading scholar on
the effect that college has upon
students is Dr. Alexander W
Astin of the Cooperative Insti
tutional Research Program at
UCLA. Dr. Astin is an alum
nus of Gettysburg College. His
work indicates that the quality
of the educational experience
that students get in college is
directly related to how much
they are involved both inside
and outside the classroom in
their college experience. Not
surprisingly, students who put
more effort into college receive

much greater benefits from
their four years of higher edu
cation. Dean Nordvall em
phasizes, however, that al
though almost all activities pro
vide benefits, not all co-curricu
lar activities are equal in what
they provide to students. Stu
dents should look for activities
that provide to them strong
opportunities for personal
growth. A small group of ac
tivities that have proved par
ticularly powerful in fostering
the growth and development of
students are the service learn
ing programs and community
service programs run through
the Center for Public Service,
the College's study abroad pro
grams, and opportunities for
independent study and re
search with professors. These
are activities that students
name as particularly important
as they reflect upon their four
years at Gettysburg. These four
are not the only activities that
play such a role, and students
can, of course, take part in a
number of very beneficial ac
tivities at the College.
The Gettysburg is Vol
unteering (GIV) Day activities

on the Friday afternoon of Ori
entation provide an example of
community service opportuni
ties at Gettysburg. On Satur
day evening during Orientation
from 7:00-8:00 pm there will
be an Open House at the Cen
ter for Public Service at which
students can find out more
about community service and
service learning programs.
Study abroad opportunities will
be discussed in the rotating dis
cussion sessions on Friday
evening of Orientation. First
year students do not ordinarily
work on research and indepen
dent study projects with pro
fessors, but during their first
year students should be sam
pling the various academic pro
grams at the College in order
to find out which programs
offer the academic challenges
and opportunities that are most
attractive to them.
Service learning pro
grams, community service pro
grams, study abroad, and inde¬

pendent study and research are
powerful experiences because
they stretch students. They
force students to do and to see
new things. They force stu
dents to look at the world dif
ferently. Students can gradu
ate from Gettysbutg College
without participating in any of
these programs, but students
who want to experience the full
range of a Gettysburg College
education should select the best
opportunities that the College
has to offer, both inside and
outside the classroom.
New Guide Available
on Social and Recreational
Opportunities There is lots to do at
Gettysburg, but sometimes stu
dents like to get off campus to
explore what is available in the
surrounding area. Dean of
First Year Students, Robert

Nordvall, has put together a
resource that sets out the op
portunities for fun and recre
ation on campus and beyond.
Included in it is information
about what to do and about
things to do in Harrisburg,
Lancaster, Baltimore, Washing
ton, and other nearby cities.
The guide includes infor
mation about shopping (where
are the big malls?), parks, the
aters, movies, clubs, concerts,
museums, sports teams, and
miscellaneous attractions
within an 80 mile radius of the
College. Driving instructions
are included so students can
find out how to get to these
attractions.

CUB: a.k.a. The College
Union Building. Here you will
find the mailroom, College
Store, Ballroom, the Junction,
and the campus alternative to
Servo, the Bullet Hole.
The Junction: This is a
place that student organiza
tions can hold meetings, the
Student Activities Council
(SAC) holds live performances
and movies, and where stu
dents can just hang out. The
couches are really comfy.
The Bullet Hole (a.k.a.
Cafe 101): Looking for a quick
snack while you're on the run?
Travel beyond the Junction,
past the mailroom, and you're
in the Bullet Hole.
You have $2.50 for break
fast, $3.75 for lunch, and $4.50
for dinner on your meal card.
Remember, only two prepack
aged items per meal. The catch
to the Bullet Hole is that you
can only use your meal cards
at specific hours: 8:00-10:15
a.m. for breakfast, 1:30-4:00

Friday night lifesaver and

Beware of the lure of fast cash.
Musselman Library: It's
Tuesday night and nothing's
going on. Where can you go to
hang out and meet new people?
The library is the answer. On
any given evening, the first two
floors are filled with students
pretending to study while pick
ing up the latest gossip on cam
pus. Plus, when you get home
and find that your parents have
called, you can honestly say
you were at the library.
But being there and
studying are two entirely dif
ferent issues. If you really need
to do some work, the third and
fourth floors are your best bet.
Night owls will be happy to see
that the library is open 24
hours a day. And for those
slaves to the almighty bean, li
brarians brew coffee and pro
vide hot water for cocoa and
tea for those students pulling
all-nighters (though you do
need to provide your own con
tainers now).
Also, the library has mov¬

( ( _c ies for three day rentals. They
may not be all the newest re
leases, but they do have some
of the best movies ever made.
You may be surprised at what
they do have, so be sure to ex
plore. Remember, only three
per trip!
The library is one of the
three Musselman locations on
campus, the others being
Musselman Stadium and
'_^lusselman Hall in the
_^ _^upperclass quad" (most of
which is now made up of first
year students).

Pizza, pizza, pizza: Each

places, but only three deliver:
Pizza House, Dominos and

Stavros Pizza in Emmitsburg

well worth the trip.
Ernie's Texas Lunch: Lo

Ernie's has been catering to the

three generations. And the
"Ernie Dog" is not to be

Subway. A convenient

Just try to remember, it isn't
updated that frequently.
Menu line: By dialing

ever, if the line is busy (as it will
most likely be, particularly
around 6 p.m.), you can access

Of course, there's much
more to learn about the 'Burg

Random Though rs
byJeph McGowan
Staring at his reflection in the win
dow, faced with the blackness outside,
our young hero ponders the road he's
about to take. He had somewhere to
go, he had to go somewhere. So he
chose where and why to go there. He
found, through some gut feeling, the
stairway to heaven and he's unbeliev
ably eager to ascend.
As wonderful as it may be, he's
never been there, and therefore doesn't
know what

to expect.
The future
looms like
some black

Teetering on

prehensibly large, he's not sure what to do or how
to act. It's what you make of it so many

Bookstores seem to offer less so
lace than I originally thought. I need
to think, need to ponder, need to talk.
My cup of cooling coffee once again
balks at the opportunity to have mean

something that is so big and so close at

that some never know what they're into
until they look back on it, or until the
impending moment looms so close that
they can do nothing about it. Like an
ant on a monster truck wheel, they
don't realize what's there until the mo
ment of squash.
But this is now and not then. I'm
looking forward, not back. I've a long
way to go. How far can one individual
come in four years?

He knows who he is, but does and
will anyone else? Almost a shame no
one has the script of life, we'd all be a
little ahead of the game. But then, who
would want it? I suppose that makes
the spice of life, not knowing the fu

Consider This....
This space is known as "Consider This," where the editorial board
expresses its views on just about anything and everything. And right
now the topic on everyone's mind is the Class of 2003 and its future at

dom it grants you. For perhaps the first time in your life, your future is
up to you alone.
No longer are your parents watching your every step, giving you
a curfew, meeting all your friends. You are now free to be whoever you
want to. Nobody here knows you; you are free from your past. It's time
to discover who you are.
You are hereby given four years. They may be the last ones you
have to live it up.
So drink. Study. Meet new people. Get involved. Don't get in
volved. Go new places. Experience things you've never experienced
before. Change. And see if you like the person you've discovered.

Gettysburg College.
By this point, you first years are probably
tired of people spouting advice at you. And
you're going to hear a lot of it over the next
few days, from your resident advisers and ori

But there's a reason people force all this
advice down your throats. We all want you to
succeed. We all want the future of Gettysburg
to be a bright one, and we know you're the
ones who can insure this.
College will be a whole new experience
for you. There will be really good times and
really bad times. You'll learn things like that it
isn't necessarily good to live with your friends
and that when you think your world is going to
end, it's those friends who will save you.
A lot will happen to you, none of which
you will expect. It's the element of surprise that
helps to make college what it is. All these sur
prises thrown at you cannot help but to change
you and help you grow.
But these are things you need to find our
for yourselves. Your entire lives have led up to
this point. And it could be the best time of your
life. Again, it's up to you.

You could ignore what s being told to you.
You could spend the next four years drinking
and partying and going to classes and that's
it. And you wouldn't be the first.

Women's lax finishes above
.500 with difficult schedule

From .sports release
When a third of the teams
on your schedule advanced to
the NCAA Division III
Women's Lacrosse Champion
ship, winning over half of your
games should be viewed as
quite an accomplishment.
The Gettysburg College
women's lacrosse team con
cluded its 1999 campaign on
the positive side of the .500
mark at 8-7. Four of the seven
losses, as well as one of its eight
wins, came against teams that
were selected to compete for
the Division III national cham¬

pionship.
"It would have been re
ally nice to have won our last
game (against Washington) to
end the season with a four
game winning streak, but we
can't really be all that disap
pointed with our record be
cause of the overall strength of
our schedule," said Carol
Cantele, the head women's la
crosse coach at Gettysburg for
the past seven seasons. "We'll
have another difficult schedule
again next year, and fortunately
just about everybody will be
back from this year's team."

In fact, players who ac
counted for all but one of the
173 goals Cantele's squad
scored are slated to return.
This year's leading scorer, jun
ior attacker Amy Stambaugh,
supplied the Bullets with 56

goals, the fourth-highest,
single-season total m school
history, and a team-leading 13
assists. For her performance,
she made the first-team attack
on the 1999 All-Centennial
Conference Women's Lacrosse
Team. Gettysburg placed two
players on the all-conference
second team in junior attacker
Kim Fernandez and sophomore
defender Jessica Seedorf. Se
nior defender Shanley Cooke
was an honorable mention on
the all-conference team.
Fernandez was runner-up
to Stambaugh in goals with 29,
but led the Bullets in ground
balls with 41. Of the players
on the team who tallied at least
eight goals, she also had the
highest shooting percentage
(.468).

Seedorf scored 12 goals
and dished out 2 assists, but it
was on defense where she was

most valuable to the Bullets in
1999. She was second on the
team in caused turnovers with
22 and among the leaders in
ground balls with 28.
One of the only two se
niors on the Gettysburg roster,
Cooke was a three year defen
sive starter. She forced nine
opponent turnovers and
scooped up 20 ground balls.
The other senior, de
fender Julie Hawthorne,
caused a team-high 32 oppo
nent turnovers and was runner
up in ground balls with 34.
A pair of freshmen trailed
only Stambaugh and Fernandez
in goals. Attackers Anna
Haugen and Becky Bucha
scored 26 and 16 goals, respec
tively. Sophomore Michele
Centrella completed her sec
ond season as the Bullets' start
ing goalie, making 124 saves
and compiling a 10.55 goals
against average.

Seniors set records , reach milestones

From sports release
Two seniors on the
Gettysburg College men's la
crosse team became the
school's new runners-up in
goals in a career and goals in a
season daring the Bullets' sea
son-ending loss to Rochester
Institute of Technology in the
quarterfinals of the 1999
NCAA Division III Men's La
crosse Championship.
With his second-period
goal that created a 5-5 tie,
Jamie Bateman, gained sole
possession of second place in
career goals at Gettysburg. By
scoring 33 times in his final sea
son with the Bullets, the
attackman concluded his career
with 147 goals.
Over his four seasons at
Gettysburg, Bateman was also
credited with 40 assists, and his
187 career points rank as the
sixth-highest total in school
history.

Attackman Brooke
Farrell tallied six goals in the
Bullets' playoff loss, boosting
his total for the season to 56
goals and 74 points. Only once
in the 35-year history of
Gettysburg's lacrosse program
has a player scored more than
56 goals in a season and that
was in 1985 when Costa
Alvanos collected 67 goals.
Farrell's 74 points equal the
fourth-highest, single season
total in school history.
Two other seniors—
defenseman Brian Abbott and
midfielder Rob Crowe-both
appeared in the 62nd games of
their careers on May 16 against
RIT, more than any other men's
lacrosse player at Gettysburg.
Abbott was in the Bullets' start
ing lineup for all 62 games over
his four years.

Abbott was the top per
former on a defensive unit that
surrendered only 91 goals in 16
games. He led the Bullets in
takeaways (35) and scooped up
53 ground balls. The onlv
player other than Abbott to
start all 16 games this season
was senior defenseman Justin
Domingos.
Crowe was the Bullets'
primary face-off specialist for
the second year in a row, win
ning 112 of the 186 face-offs
he attempted (.602). In addi-

handing out 10 assists, he toped Another senior, Lee
the team in ground balls with Hemming, was the leading

scorer from the midfield in
1999 with 34 goals and 16 as
sists. Runner-up to Hemming
in points by a midfielder was
sophomore Tommy Pearce,
with 27 goals and 13 assists.
Junior Andrew Barter
was the Bullets' starting goalie
in 14 games this season. He
made 151 saves and allowed
only 72 goals, finishing with a
5.81 goals against average and
a .677 save percentage. In the
final game of the regular sea
son against Ithaca, he became
only the seventh goalie in

school history to surpass 500
saves in his career.
Barter was selected Player
of the Year in the Centennial
Conference in balloting by the
conference's seven head
coaches, making him the first
goalie to earn that distinction
in the conference's six-year his
tory. Barter, Farrell, Abbott,
Crowe and Hemming were all
first-team selections on the
1999 All-Centennial Confer
ence Men's Lacrosse Team.
Bateman and Pearce were
joined on the second team by

sophomore defensive
midfielder Mike Plantholt.
Head Coach Hank
Janczyk's 1999 squad matched
the school record for wins in a
season by going 13-3. The
Bullets captured their fourth
Centennial Conference title in
six years by going 6-0 in con
ference play, made their tenth
appearance—all since 1989
and under Janczyk—in the
NCAA Division III tourna
ment, and were ranked No. 1
in Division III by the United
States Intercollegiate Lacrosse
Association from April 19
through the end of the regular
season.

Woods. Senior Mike Wallo was
named to the second team all
conference, while junior desig
nated hitter Jack Tanner was
given honorable mention.
Gettysburg finished the
season with a 22-11-1 record
for its best finish since the 28
wins of 1988. The Bullets were
13-5 in the conference, good
for second place behind
Ursinus.
Sophomore short stop
Brett Thorp was second to
Woods with a .327 batting av
erage, followed by senior out
fielder Darryl Clancy and
sophomore outfielder Jim

of a broken hand, junior out
fielder John Woods won his
second Gettysburg College
baseball batting title in two
years. However, the .328 av
erage he posted this year was
far below the .439 of the year
before and the .404 of his
freshman year.
Reverting back to the
wooden bats this season was
the main reason for the drop
in averages across the board.
However, while the batting av
erages dropped, so did the
pitchers' earned run averages.
This year's 2.67 was the best
recorded by a Bullet pitching
staff since the 2.52 recorded in
1968. Sophomore southpaw
Drew Chiesa was the leader
with a 1.14 ERA for 78 2/3 in
nings. He notched 57
strikeouts en route to a 9-2
record.
Chiesa not only was

Woods, a two-time holder of
the baseball batting title,
performed exceptionally well
during the season as did
many of his teammates.

Thorp paced the team
with 37 hits and 20 runs bat
ted in. Woods, who had six
home runs in each of the last

two years, was held to three
triples this season. Junior out
fielder Greg Kosc dropped to
.255 batting, but led the team
with five doubles. He and
Clancy each stole ten bases.
Gettysburg had two other
pitchers place among the con
ference leaders. They were
sophomores Tom Boob and
Mike Klinepeter. Boob was 5
1 with a 2.74 ERA and 44
strikeouts while Klinepeter
posted a 3-2 record, 1.52 ERA
and notched 38 strikeouts.
Two of Gettysburg's play
ers were named to the Centen
nial Conference Academic
Honor Roll. Those selected
had to have a 3.40 grade point
average or better. The two
Bullets were Wallo and junior
Kevin Grimm. Wallo is a Ger
man major and Grimm a math
and psychology major.

John Campo, who com
pleted his 13th season as
Gettysburg's head coach,
picked up his 214th victory this
season to move over the .500
mark by two games.
