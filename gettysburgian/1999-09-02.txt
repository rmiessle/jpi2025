Hypnotist Frank Santos entertained the campus community Sunday evening with his
raunchy humor. This performance was part of the Welcome Week program.

with —
Honor Code testing on August 30.
"Orientation was cool because
you got to meet a lot of people and
our Orientation Leader was a very en
thusiastic leader," said Matt Mahon,
first-year student.
Students began their first day by
meeting one of the 65 orientation
groups followed by brief discussions
with faculty advisors. Opening Con
vocation then featured an array of ad
ministration and faculty speakers along
with student speaker Abigail Sholer
'00. Parents were asked to leave fol
lowing this ceremony.
The next few days were just as
eventful. Open houses were held Sat
urday night by such organizations as
Student Senate, The Center for Public
Service, The Gettysburgian, and Greek
Life. Rotating discussions, which took
place Friday and Saturday, gave stu
dents a chance to learn about the

Honor Code, Off-Campus Studies,
Musselman Library and general informa
tion on Life at Gettysburg College.
Placement tests were given, Col-

Students had their selection of
other events. Many first-year students
participated in GIV day helping out or
ganizations including the Heritage Fes
tival, National Park Service and many
more. While some students did not par
ticipate in GIV, many played sand vol
leyball or met with faculty advisors,
which was mandatory sometime preced
ing registration.
"GIV day was a good opportunity
to meet new people and interact with
the kids at the Day Care Center where I
went," Scott Manroe '03 said.
A scavenger hunt and departmen
tal open houses held on Saturday were
some other options open to students.
Various prizes from area businesses were
awarded to the winners of the hunt.
Fifteen departmental open houses gave
students a chance to ask questions, get
information, and meet faculty from 3-5
p.m. as well.

Rain made some changes in the
plans necessary as the assembling of ori
entation groups, Opening Convocation,
and the First-Year picnic all had to be
held indoors.
"The rain definitely affected the
first day. It's really pretty to have things
outdoors, but
_^
¦¦¦¦ _^ ¦ _e s_^m_^ it all worked

out well," said
Sedlacko.
Nightlife
was alive and
well during
Orientation.
On Thursday,
students went
to the Junc
tion for food
and music to
enjoy a First
Year Social.
Friday
night brought
Imani, a trio
of women
from Philadel
phia, to per
form songs
spanning
from the 60's
to today.
Steve Wiley, a
1973 gradu
humored and

ate of Gettysburg, both
educated students with his motivational
speech on college and success.
Speaking of humor, David J ap
peared for the third time, making ev
eryone laugh at his jokes on eveiything
from love and life to Wal-Mart and
work, and several aspects of Gettysburg
College. "They (Imani, David J, and
Steve Wiley) were our biggest successes.
I think their performances were incred
ible," Sedlacko said.
"These are the Days" came to a
close with a bang on Sunday with the
Orientation Banquet catered by the
College's dining service.
"1 think the Class of 2003 is go
ing to be a really strong class. Strong in
numbers, academically, and they are
going to have to unite during the next

From GCPR
As a teen, Jody Marshall
was coming home from work
when he saw a white Monte
Carlo crash into another ve
hicle. After spinning several
times, the other vehicle rolled
on its side. Another passerby
and Marshall helped tilt the car
so that the driver could crawl
out of the wreckage. What
they didn't know was that the
accident had fractured her
spine in three places, fractured
her skull and broken her jaw.
"While my intentions
were good, my actions could
have paralyzed her," said
Marshall, a senior at
Gettysburg College. "I became
an emergency medical techni
cian (EMT) so that the next
time I saw an accident, I would

know what I should do.
Marshall has found a
number of other Gettysburg
students who share his interest
in emergency medicine. He is
one of more than 15 students
who volunteered this past year
for the Gettysburg Fire Depart
ment. "There are times when
the ambulance runs a call, and
it is a college student who is
driving the ambulance, a col
lege student who is an EMT,
and a college student who _<s a
First Responder," said Chris
tine Sedlacko, a senior from
Latrobe who serves as the crew
chief with the fire department.
As chief, she "runs the call and
leads the others who respond,"
according to Fire Chief Larry

Benefactors Wall nears completion

From GCPR
It's been a busy summer
campus construction and reno
vation have been «••• - ¦¦,-,,

ongoing for
months. While
some of the
work is not par
ticularly obvi
ous, there's a
new structure by
Glatfelter Lodge
that should at
tract everyone's
attention - the
Benefactors Wall
which cites the
names of alumni
and friends who
have each con
tributed 1 mil
lion dollars or
more in outright
gifts or realized
estate provisions
to the College.
"I hope
that the Wall
in

_piaceu a
highly trafficked area of cam
pus, will help educate our stu
dents and faculty about the im
portant role that philanthropy

On October 16, the
Gettysburg College Board of

Volunteer firefighters

Weikert.
In the past, six or seven
students usually volunteered at
the Fire Department, Weikert
said. He attributes the in
creased number of volunteers

to an EMT course that was of
fered at Gettysburg College for
the first time last spring. The
course was organized by John
Regentin, the College's associ
ate director nf student devel-

- continued from page 2 -
opment, who is also a volun
teer EMT.
"My first thought was to
develop a campus program so
that students could respond to
campus calls and reduce the

response time," he said. "I
couldn't find a course to fit my
needs or students' schedules,"
Regentin said, "so I created my
own." "'John approached me last
December to find out if the stu
dents could use the Fire Depart
ment to fulfill their training re
quirements," Weikert said. "I
said sure, but they would need
to become members and be
trained for our department."
Student members work
the Fire Department's night
shift and are on duty from 10
pm until 8 am, according to
Weikert. They may also sign up
to work the evening shift,
which runs from 5:30 until 10
pm. "Some nights we run three
calls in the middle of the night,"
Sedlacko said, "and I just have
to wake up fast and drive up
there. It's hard getting up for
classes after a night like that,
but it hasn't affected my grades
or class attendance."

"We stress academics with
the students," Weikert added.
"Many of them use the fire
department's library to study
while they're here. They're a
big help, but we want them to
do well in school."
While many of the stu
dents run ambulance calls as
First Responders and EMTs, Ed
Smith, a senior from
Chappaqua, N.Y., is a trained
and certified firefighter who
also drives ambulances. "I
joined the fire department in
Gettysburg after being an ex
tremely active member of the
Millwood Volunteer Fire Com
pany in Westchester County
from the time I was 16-years
old," he said. "Several of my
relatives-my brother and two
uncles-were firemen at one
time." Many other Gettysburg
College students who volunteer

at the Gettysburg Fire Depart
ment "come from families in
fire service," according to
Weikert, and volunteered for
their hometown fire companies
as well. "I joined because I'm
an EMT back home in Con
necticut," said Jay Bresky, a
junior from Easton. "I'm look
ing to become a professional
rescuer as half of my career. I
plan on having a job that will
put food on my table, but the
job I love will be running with
a fire department."
"Senior Susan Dollhopf
of Springfield, Ohio, also vol
unteers with her future in
mind. "All of my experiences
at the fire department help me
to prepare for medical school,"
Dollhopf said. "For those
choosing a career as a
physician's assistant, it's criti
cal to have a large chunk of
time dedicated to hands-on
patient care. Volunteering not
only allows me to give back to
the community, but it also
helps me prepare for my fu¬

ture. Weikert appreciates the
time these Gettysburg College
students volunteer for the com
munity, and he wants others to
know that sometimes college
students get a bum rap from
local residents. "These kids are
great kids who are willing to
give up their time to help
people," he said. "They aren't
out causing problems, but they
sometimes take the heat for a
few who do. They do this (vol
unteer) because they care, and
they're good people."
"I joined the fire com
pany because I love helping
people," Marshall said. "While
not every event turns out suc
cessfully, it is an incredible
event when someone recovers
and can continue on with their
life"

These are the days

continued from front page

four years with all of the new
things coming up on campus,"
Sedlacko said.
"I also want to thank all
of the Orientation Leaders, the
committee, Sue Plank and Bob
Nordvall who helped me out a
lot." Sedlacko added.

As the theme song of this
year's orientation by Natalie
Merchant goes, "These are the
days you'll remember. Never
before and never since, I prom
ise, will the whole world be as
warm as this." For the class of
2003, these words definitely
ring true.

College adjusts to growing pains

Cara Masucci
Staff Writer
If you have looked around lately,
it seems there are a lot more faces than
normal on campus. That's because of
the outstanding year admissions had last
year of students deciding that
Gettysburg was the place for them. In
fact, this was the best year that
Gettysburg College has had for admis
sions ever.
If you think that this just a phe
nomenon that Gettysburg is experienc
ing, think again. "Many colleges have
been experiencing a similar growth in
their incoming class this year," said
Robert Nordvall, Dean of First Year Stu
dents. It's hard to ignore the fact that
there are many new faces on campus
this fall. Gettysburg's reputation has
begun to soar the last few years for a
variety of reasons. While Gettysburg has
the charm and closeness of a small lib
eral arts college, it still has many of the
advantages that larger schools have.

Gettysburg is ranked number
eight in the nation by Yahoo for the
most wired college campuses.
Gettysburg is also ranked number 3 in
the nation in terms of food service by
the Princeton Review Guide. This com
bined with the many other charming
aspects of the College boosted the
amount of students who felt Gettysburg
was their choice.
"I chose Gettysburg because ev
erything was so beautiful and everyone
was so friendly on campus when I came
to visit," said Amanda Marsella, a first
year student. Marsella a perspective
Psychology major, like many other first
year students, enjoys the convenience
of CNAV and the great food at the din
ning hall so far.
"It (the College) was everything
that I thought of when I pictured a col
lege," said Marsella. With an increased
number of students on campus this fall,
many people feel that the school can
not handle the numbers.
¦

"While there might be some tem
porary overcrowding, and a few more
advisees for faculty members, it will
certainly not be by large amounts," said
Nordvall.
On the contrary, the increase in
students has actually facilitated an in
crease in options available to students
in many areas of campus life. "There

were four areas of campus life we tar
geted once we found out the class would
be larger than expected: faculty and
class availability, housing, library and
classroom availability and dinning," said
Julie Ramsey, Dean of the College.
The first area, class availability,
was a concern of the College in trying
to keep numbers right around the aver
age 15-20 students per class. "President
Haaland allocated $200,000 to help
with hiring of new faculty members and
make more class sections available," said
Ramsey. Many of these classes were at
the introductory level and courses that
would typically be filled by first year
students.
The second area that was focused
on this summer was housing. "We
worked closely with the business office
to look at accommodating the first year
students," said Tim Rupe, Director of
Residence Life. "The Colonial Motel
presented itself first to us this summer -
the owner was very open to working
with us." While the zoning was being

examined on the Colonial, the owners
of the Appleford Inn approached the
College and asked if the school would
like to buy the property.
"We are always trying to provide
as many options as possible for student
housing - I'm excited that we have this
option available," said Rupe. Upper
classmen will be housed in both the
Appleford and Colonial, freeing up
spaces in Mussleman for first year stu
dents. Appleford is housing all upper
class women this year, and the Colo
nial motel is currently being turned over
to house sophomores in a little less than
two weeks.
In the library, more study spaces
were added on the first floor and some
study rooms were also added on differ
ent levels. There were also many spaces
that were not being used last year, con
verted to classroom space.
The dinning hall also made some
adjustments this year according to Dean
Ramsey. "We have ordered some new
furnishings for the CUB lounge so that

students can take their food from the
Bullet Hole and Grab'n'Go into the
lounge," said Ramsey. The dinning hall
is also serving breakfast and lunch at
outside locations while the weather is
nice. In a few months the school hopes
to make additional eating space avail
able in the old laundry room of the
CUB. "Things seem to be going
smoothly due to these adjustments,"
said Ramsey.
The College has a long-term goal
to boost enrollment and add new op
tions to campus life. Ramsey, Nordvall
and Rupe all feel that these changes and
additions have been excelerated by the
size of the first year class. It makes the
Gettysburg education worth more in the
long run.
This year's class is going to help
facilitate growth in various organiza
tions on campus, help boost the aca
demic integrity of Gettysburg, and do
what each student on the campus is
doing right now - making the school
better.

\Library BULLETin
I Tables and videos
j disappear at library

• Dear Libby,
_• Why did you take the tables and
• chairs off the front porch of the li
"brary? My friends and I liked to sit
• out there and eat and study. Since
•you're so strict about no food in the
library, why did you take away the one
J place we have to sit and eat near the
• library?
• • The tables belonged to the Bul
• let Hole and we put them out last year
• as an experiment to see if students
•liked them (they did!) and to see if
.they were stolen (they weren't). We
• had to give that furniture back to the
a Bullet Hole but we've ordered new
•tables and chairs and am told they'll
, be delivered in the next two weeks.
• By the way, we are strict about no food
, in the library but that's not because
•we're trying to be mean. Food attracts

insects and rodents which love to dine
on the books and journals. We had bats
and chipmunks living quite well on
everyone's leftovers last year. So thanks
for keeping the food out.
Dear Libby,
Everything is disappearing from
the library. First it was the tables and
chairs on the front porch. Now its the
videos. Next thing you know there
won't be any reference librarians.
What's going on?
Looks like you haven't been down
to the ground floor yet. Head down the
staircase and through the double doors.
You can't miss them. We moved the
videos and consolidated the reference
collection to make more room for
studying on the main floor. The videos
have a new arrangement too. All the

documentaries are together and*
shelved by call number. The popular, *
oi feature films are together and ar- •
ranged alphabetically by title. All the *
new films, (both features and docu- •
mentanes) are right in the front with •
a star on the label to show they are •
the new arrivals. Except for the new •
titles, which are in the box, you still •
need to get the actual video at the Cir- •
dilation desk, and everything has to «
be checked-out at the desk. •
Do you have complaints or #
questions about library service? Send «
your gripes to Libby at my campus •
email lmussel. If you're technologi-,
cally impaired and prefer the old fash- •
ioned method, write it on a piece of

Hypnotist puts Gettysburg under his spell

BY RENEE _AOAMt
Contributing Writer
If you've seen people on
campus acting like they are the
Spice Girls, Michael Jackson or
are seeing aliens, then they may
be some of the courageous stu
dents picked out of Sunday
night's audience in Bream
Wright Hauser.
R-rated hypnotist, Frank
Santos, visited Gettysburg Col
lege on Sunday evening at 8:00,
to give a provocative show en
tertaining the crowd by hypno
tizing fourteen students. The
performance capped off four
days of Orientation activities
for first year students new to
Gettysburg.

Santos first cut down a
group of twenty-five volunteers
to fourteen by judging their sus
ceptibility to hypnosis. After
coaxing them into an extremely
relaxed state, he instructed
them to fall into his arms, test
ing their vulnerability. Don
Vymazal_, one of the students
who did not pass the vulner
ability test, said, "I thought that
it was cool that he couldn't
overpower my mind."
Santos then began the
process of hypnotizing the stu
dents. He first asked them to
close their eyes, and drop their
head forward. He then told
them that their arms and their
legs were getting very heavy.
After ten minutes of soothing
music and soft talk, they were

all under his spell.
The demonstration began
with simple commands, as
Santos manipulated a male vol
unteer into scratching himself,
convinced the entire panel that
they couldn't move their arms
and made them all believe they
smelled a bad fart.
The real fun began when
he caused the group of guys to
dance like Chip'n'Dale dancers
and instructed the whole panel
to act like ballerinas. The
evening was reduced to com
plete chaos and its R-rated
reputation when Santos con
vinced the group that they were
seeing the entire audience na
ked and having sex.
Missy Lorah, a senior at
Gettysburg, and one of the stu¬

dents who was brave enough to
enter under Santos' spell said
dazedly, "I don't remember
anthing..." when asked about
her actions that evening. At
one point in the show Lorah
writhed around onstage, believ
ing their was a bug in her bra.
"I feel really tired and
have a bad headache," Lorah
also said.
Most students thor
oughly enjoyed the perfor
mance, like first year Bonnie
Duncan, who said, "I thought
that it was hilarious when the
guys got up and danced."
However, some students
who viewed the performance
had mixed emotions about
Santos and his vulgarity. Sasha
Birschbach, a first year, said, "I

though he was a little too blunt
in the way he phrased things
and what he made people do."
First year Kasey Carigan,
who enjoyed the show just fine
from the safety of the bleach
ers explained, "I liked the show,
but I felt bad for the kids that
were in it."
Santos got his start as a
hypnotist comedian twenty
years ago by going to a local
clinic. He said that he started
so he could get his mind off
smoking. Santos thought that
"the Gettysburg students were
a lot of fun." Santos can next
be seen at Bryant College on
September 4th and Boston Col
lege on September 5th. You can

First year students learn to cope

New students face roommate issues, party dangers and Servo food bead on

by Ashley Froman
Contributing Writer
As we find ourselves in a
whirlwind of new roommates,
college courses, and simply ad
justing to the fact that we are
finally out on our own, we "the
college freshmen," find our
selves once again at the bottom
of the barrel. Just when we
thought we knew it all, we re
alize that this isn't going to be
as easy as we had anticipated.
Some of us that had the plea
sure of enduring our very first
preseason were hit smack in the

face with a major reality check.
As opposed to high school aca
demics, we are actually going
to have to take notes in class as
well as study the night before
instead of cramming during the
five minutes we used to have
between classes.
Although orientation had
its ups and downs, most of us
would agree that all of the in
formation that was provided
will eventually come into use
somewhere along the line.
While the majority of the Ro
tating Discussions dealt with
academic issues such as how to

use our computers or how to
plan out our schedule, the rest
touched on topics that dealt
with the overall social scene
here at Gettysburg. Date rape
prevention, alcohol poisoning
and even getting a bad reputa
tion (watch out for Seth, girls!)
were issues that some freshmen
may never even thought to con
sider before orientation. Ori
entation also gave us a chance
to become acquainted with
people outside our halls or ath
letic teams. It was definitely
advantageous to be able to be
cnme _familiarized with the

campus before the upperclass
men arrived.
Now comes the issue of
the cafeteria. As far as the food
is concerned, they get a ten. We
can finally eat ice cream and
pizza for every meal! But what
is up with the miniature
glasses? Do they want more
dishes to wash or are they just
hoping that the freshman with
six glasses on his tray will wipe
out and provide some comic
relief for the entire student
body? And I have noticed that
the "one helping rule" varies
from student to student. Does
that mean if you are a little on

the scrawny side, they will ac
tually let you take more food
than the hefty kid next to you?
Finally, we come to the
biggest adjustment that we, as
freshmen (or should I say, first
years) have to make: living with
a stranger. Being able to com
promise is a definite must when
it comes to living with some
one else. However, I have al
ready come across roommates
that have irreconcilable differ
ences. For instance, one female
athlete likes to go to bed early
in complete darkness and si
lence. Her roommate not only
goes to bed late, but sleeps with
the light on and TV blaring.
They have already requested a
room change. A lot of fresh
men feel that maybe the room
mate contract should have been
filled out over the summer and
then be assigned roommates
accordingly. That way some of
the later hassles could be
avoided.

Despite these few minor
setbacks, as we adjust to our
new surroundings I think it
would be safe to say that
Gettysburg has done an excel
lent job of making us feel wel
come.

Liberal arts schools offer what others can t

by Kathryn Mohrman
Knight-Ridder
Newspapers
"Catch a wave and you're
sitting on top of the world," or
so the Beach Boys would have
us believe in their summer an
thems. But as any surfer will tell
you, the thrill can be short
lived - after riding one wave to
shore, you must swim out and
try to find, another, hoping to
be in the right place at the right
time. The same is true of waves
in higher education. As the col
lege search process hits high
gear in these waning days of
summer and into the fall, the
future Class of 2004 and their
parents should keep surfing in
mind: The schools, majors and
professions most in demand
today could be just another
wave, a trend that has already
or will soon reach its crest.
A college education

should be more than a creden
tial, a perceived ticket for ad
mission to one's first job - that's
just the latest wave. In the most
recent Newsweek/Kaplan's
"How to Get Into College" is
sue, Seppy Basih, executive di
rector of Kaplan Educational
Centers, discusses this trend
and points students to an alter
native. "With society going
through such rapid technologi
cal change, the college logo on
your degree matters far less
than the thinking and commu
nication skills that can come
from a liberal arts program," he
writes. "Employers are begin
ning to recognize this. It's time
that more students did, too."
In spite of the movement
toward technical colleges, spe
cialized programs, and big
brand-name universities, tradi
tional liberal arts colleges - and
the values to which they are
committed -continue to pros
per. Why? Here are a few
points to consider:
-Residential liberal arts

colleges offer a unique educa
tional environment marked by
a focus on undergraduate stu
dents. Classes are smaller,
based on interaction and dia
logue more than lecture, and
are taught by professors as op
posed to teaching assistants. At
the same time, these colleges
share a commitment to service
learning and ethics.
-With healthy endow
ments, the nation's top liberal
arts colleges spend many times
more money per student than

their larger college and univer
sity counterparts. And those
funds are more likely to be
spent on student programming
including research, study
abroad and financial aid.
Prospective students and
their families need to know that
the high-tech, career/vocation
oriented and othei trendy op
tions aren't their only choice in
education. Since the founding
of the United States, liberal arts
has been the education of
_choice for many of our best and
brightest students.

Letters to the Editor

The Scopes trial revisited?
The remarks made by all of the
presidential candidates concerning the
recent monkey business in Kansas deni
grating the teaching of evolution in the
public schools reveal to the American
people that they are scientific illiterates
and therefore unfit to lead the most
powerful nation on planet earth.
If one were to follow the logic of
the present crop of presidential
"wannabes," people who hold to the
idea that the earth is flat ought to be
able to present their arguments against
the "theory" that the earth is round.
After all, the flat-earthers have the Bible
on their side.
Trying to sound cosmopolitan and
broad-minded, Republican presidential
hopeful George W. Bush was quoted on
August 26 as saying, "I believe children
ought to be exposed to different theo
ries about how the world started."

One feels obliged to ask the Gov
ernor of Texas whether the ancient
Egyptian creationist doctrine that the
existence of the cosmos and everything
in it is owed to the masturbation of
Atum is to be taught as a competing
"scientific theory" in the public schools?
This ancient "scientific" creation
ism is described in detail on page 246
in volume one oiThe Interpreter's Bible
which was published by the Abingdon
Press of New York and Nashville in

1952. Should local school districts really
be fiee to impose such nonsense on chil
dren? That is a question that all of the
presidential candidates should be
obliged to answer.

A breath of fresh air ... please
That powerful odor you may have
encountered while walking by
Schmucker is actually tar being applied
to the roof of the building. At least one
other college building was tarred this
summer. But now, with school in ses
sion, and a 100+ piece marching band,
music and art students using the facili
ties of Schmucker, we have a bit of a
problem.
Wednesday morning many stu
dents and faculty were actually evacu
ated from Schmucker due to the over
powering smell of tar. To be sure, this

would be an inconvenience for any de
partment working in a building while
it was being lathered in tar.
It is particularly discomforting for
music students, who generally require
a fair amount of clean air to breathe
when singing or playing wind instru
ments.
I wonder if someone could calcu
late in dollars the hours lost in class time
when the building was evacuated, or the
time lost for students to practice, and
then the school could reimburse the stu
dents involved. For this, I'm not hold
ing my breath.

What I would like is an apology
from the administration to the art stu
dents, music students, and other mem
bers of the college community who use
Schmucker. An admission that some
body screwed up, somebody didn't fin
ish a job on time. A simple apology. For
this... and for the smell (I am writing
this in Schmucker as clouds of smoke
fly by the window)... I will hold my
breath.

Consider This

Increased enrollment at Gettysburg means a potentially more di
verse campus and larger departments with more student activity and
involvement. It also requires a proportional increase in the size of the
College's academic and support structures to make certain the school
grows along with the student body.
Class size is on the rise already, and the noontime picnic out
side Servo is evidence of overcrowding in the campus' only dining
center. The personal attention by faculty and smaller class sizes that
attract students to a liberal arts college such as Gettysburg are threat
ened by the bulging numbers of students en-

tering each year. Gettysburg needs to either
become more selective in admissions, or pre
pare to let out the seams of the campus a little
in order to support a bigger student popula
tion. A second smaller, but full-service dining
center would be one way to help deal with the
milling throngs of people in Servo during peak
rneal times. Such a move would help traffic
flow and reduce wait times in meal lines, but
might create an unwelcome social split on
campus. Another option would be to renovate
and expand the existing Dining Center to alle
viate the crowding problems that worsen each
year.

The faculty needs to be expanded by al
most 20% in order to keep class size down.
Some classes, like Psych 101 or English Comp
will always be large. Upper-level courses in
many departments frequently have enroll
ments of thirty to forty people, which is simply
ridiculous. More faculty are needed to main
tain the personal atmosphere expected of a
small liberal arts college, and to justify the
above average $30,000 price tag of admission.
Musselman Library is quickly becoming
ineffective as a work area for our increasing
number of students. The book and periodical
collection is quite good, but the library is often
noisy and overcrowded, not an environment

by la. isherwood
Social Columnist
Yet another grand year
has begun here at Gettysburg
and the sight of the smiles and
overall friendliness of the re
turning students who are eager
to see old familiar faces is abun
dant. This general attitude of
goodwill is a stark contrast to
the attitudes of early May when
it seems everyone is just a little
bit tense, cranky and anxious
to leave.
Thus as autumn ap
proaches the campus is alive

this _bwe ot Cynicism
To the first years from the seniors

with people looking to make a
fresh start, or rather a fresh at
tempt, at scholarship and cam
pus activities.
This year, 689 new stu
dents are faced with the fright
ening ordeal of moving away
from home and starting a new
life with a fresh sense of hope
that all of their expectations
and dreams will be fullfilled. Of
course not all of these expec
tations, hopes and dreams will
come to be, but some of them
may, and the rest will change
and adapt into more realistic
aspirations.

As a sidenote to all of this
rhetoric, I noticed that while I
was away in England the class
above me left and has been re
placed with a new class that
doesn't really look any differ
ent than their predecessors. Yes,
maybe they are younger and
more bright-eyed, but what is
interesting is that the people
who often come to Gettysburg
have the same exact look, and
often the same disposition. I
won't elaborate since doing so
would only back me into a cor
ner which I could not defend.
So we are all back, friends
and enemies, brothers and sis
ters: fellow 'burgians, and we
are trying to make this the best
campus community possible.
For this column I decided that
my words of advice to the new
class should be put on hold
(and I expect the first years to

away this summer in on the
Quad, in front of Glatfelter
Lodge. A Benefactor's Wall
was constructed, which in
cludes the names of donors
whose lifetime giving to the
College is $1 million or more.
We will dedicate the wall later
this fall, at which time we will
have an opportunity to say
thank you to the many alumni
and friends of Gettysburg Col
lege who make it possible for
us to remain true to our mis
sion of providing the best pos
sible education to young stu
dents. This semester, we also
welcome Daniel Gilbert, the
College's first David LeVan

Professor of
Ethics and
Management.
Professor Gil
bert comes to
us from
Bucknell Uni
versity, where
he was on the
faculty from
1987 to 1999.
He served as a
visiting profes¬

sor at the University of Virginia
Olsson Center for Applied Eth
ics this past academic year.
Prior to his academic career, he
worked in admissions at
Moravian College and held
several executive positions at
NCR Corporation in Ohio and
NCR Comten Inc. in Minne
sota and Canada.
As we begin this new aca
demic year, I would like us to
remember an important mo
ment that occurred in the Col
lege community last February,

when the campus came to
gether in solidarity to celebrate
differences and acceptance.
Last winter's activities brought
us together in a way that was
quite special to Gettysburg
College and made all of us—
students, faculty, staff and ad
ministrators—feel united and
proud of our community.
When we observe the Gettys
burg College Day of Solidarity
next year, let us join together
again to celebrate our commu
nity.
Welcome back to campus.
Gordon Haaland
President

I would like to welcome
students, faculty and staff back
to campus after what I hope has
been a rewarding and refresh
ing summer. This fall marks
Gettysburg College's 167th
academic year.
As you look around the
campus you will notice some
physical changes that have oc
curred since the beginning of
the summer. One of the most
dramatic changes is near Con
stitution Avenue, where the
skyline looks quite different.
The Quarry Suites, the new
residence hall, is under con
struction and progressing on
schedule. We expect that the
complex will open in January.

When the
Quarry Suites open,
Huber Hall
will then be
closed so
that we can
make some
necessary changes to
Huber's
plumbing
and electri¬

cal systems. Students in Huber
will be relocated to the new
residence hall. In addition to
these changes, the College pur
chased the Appleford Inn, an
1870 Victorian former bed and
breakfast on Carlisle Street, to
provide alternative housing for
some of our students.
We are pleased to an
nounce that this year's First
Year Class has arrived on cam
pus, robust in numbers and in
terests. As you may already
know from an early summer

A message
from the
president

New York Times article, col
leges and universities around
the country have experienced
record enrollments. We are no
exception, and feel fortunate
that we were the first choice of
so many fine applicants to the
Class of 2003. To accommo
date our largest class ever, we
have placed additional re
sources in the areas of academ
ics, college life, and advising.
We welcome the members of
the Class of 2003, and look
forward to their engagement as
they join our community.
Another physical change
that occurred while you were

1. "Look on the bright side
- only four more years to go."
2. "Don't buy your first pair
of black pants till after Christ
mas; they might not fit you by
the end of the semester."
3. "Pizza House isn't really
as good as you think it is."
4. "Be nice to your RAs"
-anRA
5. "Just because you got into
here doesn't mean you're all
that; in fact, it means you're
not."
6. "Don't listen to every
thing your advisers tell you."
7. "Everyone was a star in
high school - now you're noth
ing !"
8. "Stop standing in the
middle of Servo - DODGE
AND WEAVE MAN, DODGE

AND WEAVE!" -Dan Jewett

9. "Look out for a short fat
guy who is waiting to tackle
you." (That must be a new tra
dition, or else even I might be
a little frightened.)
10. "I have two words -
Stalker Net!"
11. "Watch out for the grate
in the middle of Stine Lake.
Trust me, it can be a bitch."
12. "In high school D equals
Diploma; freshman year D
equals Dead End Job."
13. "Don't skip too many
classes because you'll get into

14. Stop wearing your
damned keys around your
necks - how else do you
think we know you're a
freshman?" Especially
_Tbe careful because of
the short fat guy.
15. "Sleep is for the
weak!"
One of the most en
tertaining comments I re
ceived during my exten
sive research was from a
male senior who when I
asked him for a quote
simply responded, "Can I
just give you my num¬

ber?" This year will pass
quickly and friendships
will be made and broken. It is
a year of change and a time to
grow in maturity. Well, that's
not entirely true, but try not to
be stupid and screw around all
of the time.
Education is a privilege
and no matter what you think
of Gettysburg as a place, of the
administration, or of the social
life, our campus is what you
make of it and your education
will take you as far as you have
the drive or will power to go.
If you don't like some
thing then just change it or try
to. Some things never change
and apathy is one of those
things. Just don't sit around all
of the time and bitch - that's
what I'm here for. Enjoy your
year and welcome, all 689 of
you to lovely and endlessly
quaint Gettysburg.

'PINION
the Viulmderm ' _s Pulpit
George W. Bush plays it clean

by John Dunlap
Political Columnist
The Presidential Election
of 2000 is fourteen months
away, but with the nation ex
cited that the reign of Bill
Clinton is nearing an end, the
race for the White House al
ready seems well on its way. At
this early stage, Texas governor
George W. Bush seems to have
a commanding lead in both the
primary and the general elec
tion. Support in both _^

polls and fund-raising _^_M
give the Republican _^^M
candidate an awesome _^^H
advantage in the up- ^^
coming caucuses and ^^
primaries. Just last
month, after spending only
seven days in Iowa, he won the
much-talked-about Iowa Re
publican Straw Poll. The result
of Governor 's early sup
port is that the Democrats and
his Republican opponents for
the GOP nomination are al
ready gunning for his head.
Hand

What has frustrated Gov
ernor Bush's opponents is that
for months they have not been
an
to hit the governor. They have
attacked his enormous and his
toric fund-raising advantage as
a sign of special interest sup
port or even possible corrup
tion. This argument is absurd;
Governor Bush is raising his
money legally and it is a sign
of his broad support. Unlike
some candidates he is not rais
ing campaign cash from Bud
dhist temples or receiving do
nations from China. By the end
of September, Bush will have
raised over 50 million dollars,
making him the top fund-raiser
ever for a presidential con
tender.

-
crats' top is- 1
sue as he has
pushed for
higher stan
dards, more
funds to schools as
opposed to adminis

, -
cused on school disci
pline. While the other
candidates were campaigning
and formulating their agendas
throughout last winter and
spring, George W. Bush was
working as Governor of Texas,
signing parental notification
for minors' abortions and cut
ting taxes while balancing the
budget once again.
Now the issue of past
drug use, specifically cocaine,
has emerged. This issue is an
example of journalism at its
worst. In the past, an allegation
was made and a candidate was
forced to answer. This is what
happened to Colorado Senator
Gary Hart on the issue of infi
delity in 1988 and to Gover
nor Bill Clinton in 1992 on
draft dodging and marital infi
delity. Reporters have no

he was twenty years old, they
are not demanding that the
President of the United States
answer questions concerning
an alleged rape and/or sexual
assault of Juanita Broderick.
Clinton has yet to deny this al
legation, a pretty sad situation
for the supposed leader of the
free world.
By looking at the Bush
family and George W. Bush's
character we can see that he is
a good man who is an excel
lent governor with the poten
tial to be a good president. His
integrity is head and shoulders
above President Clinton's and
by next year he will continue
to stand above Mr. Clinton's
chief cheerleader, Vice Presi
dent Al Gore.

Raising that much money
means that the governor's sup
port is not from a particular
industry or special interest but
is very broad and a sign of his

appeal.
As for the issue of the
Governor of Texas not spelling
his platform out, once again the
other GOP candidates are
showing their weakness. Unlike
most of his opponents, Gover
nor Bush has been elected to
public office, the Chief Execu
tive of our second largest state.
His record is clear for the pub
lic to see, it is one of a compas
sionate conservative who cut
taxes and has been tough on
crime. On the issue of education
_^ he has taken away the

sources on the Governor's drug
use and we know that Gover
nor Bush has not used drugs in
the past twenty-five years and
does not even touch alcohol.
Bill Clinton and the
Democrats called for the end
of politics of personal destruc
tion, even as they were trash
ing their political opponents.
Governor Bush is now keeping
another one of President
Clinton's broken promises.
An interesting aside to
this whole drug issue is that
while the media is demanding
for George W. Bush to answer

First year musings: poised
at the edge of a new life

byJeph McGowan
First year columnist
Sitting here in my tempo
rary abode, I'm thinking this
isn't the worst thing in the
world. The dinnertime thanks
giving feasts are a welcome
change from home. The loud
music and people are nearby, a
novel idea, considering where
I'm from. Sleep seems to be at
a premium, I've noticed. Who
needs sleep when you've got

college? And pizza.
Except for that smell
that won't completely go
away, even with both

_fansi going!
and!
both]
w i n -I
d o ws
open, I
like
t h e
setup.
I'm not
sure about the

weather. You'd think, expect
even, for it to be somewhat
consistent. Well, no, of course
not. Not here. Hot, sticky and
nasty? We've got that. Random
rain? We've got that too. It's
like Servo. Take a little bit of
everything. We're here to serve
you.
Love those townies.
Let's go to Wal-Mart.
Coming here as the sole
representative of my town has
its inherent difficulties, includ
ing not knowing anyone at all.
I've met people all over, just
walking around the dorm, or
around campus, which I rather
enjoy. Looking out into the
crowd last night, it's hard to
find one person, hard to single
out someone to talk to. It's like
looking up into the sky at two
in the morning walking back
from eating pizza and picking
out a star to wish on.

It's even more difficult
when you had a star you pre¬

ferred, even liked a bit, and
can't remember what its name
was or which dorm it lives in.
It's a big sky up there, and it's
a big campus.
It's also the fourth day of
school, and classes haven't even
started yet. Speaking of which,
classes start tomorrow, I'm not
sure what to think about that.
The weekend's been fun, get
ting moved in and meeting new
people has been, too. I don't
quite know what to do with
learning. Actually studying and
going to class is going to be
_^^ an experience in itself.
_^_Al Thinking about it, I
~~J/\ can't imagine wanting
_^y _} the script to life.

said, I'm not sure what I d do
if someone left it in with my
books at the college store. It'd
be a nice reference tool to have,
but I think that ranks in the
Honor Code violations list. It
would take away the magic of
the day. Depends what your
day is like, and if you appreci
ate the curveballs you're some
times thrown.
Sleeping and eating aren't
what they used to be, but this
is only the fourth day and
classes haven't even started yet.
Still, the anxiety has already
kicked in. Coming from a little
school with no familiar faces in
the sea of eyes in the sky, find
ing home so far away may be a
slight difficulty.
Even so, given the over
whelming odds just to get here,
it shouldn't be that hard. That's
what I say, not what I know. It's
what I hope, not what will hap

Gettysburg says good-bye to a friend

by Josh Eyi _h.r
Staff Writer
On Friday, May 14,
1999, the Gettysburg College
community suffered a tragic
loss when Christopher Clifford
(class of '98) was killed in a car
accident. Clifford was killed
when the car he was travelling
in struck an oncoming vehicle.
Jamie Binnall (class of '98) was
seriously injured in the crash as
well and is now recovering at
his home.
Chris Clifford was a
member of Gettysburg's wres
tling team for four years and
served as the team's co-captain
his junior and senior years. He
competed in both the 158 and
167 weight classes during his
successful career.

As a wrestler, we will re
member him for his tenacity on
the mat, the constant fire he
displayed even in the most tir
ing of matches, and, most of all.

_, . _..„ ..... ., . . .. pholo by Emily _Glatfalter
Chris Clifford: outstanding wrestler, outstanding person.

his leadership and loyal support
of his teammates. Troy Dell,
who both wrestled with Chris
and coached him, first as an

assistant and later as head
coach, remarked: "You can
define Chris's career the way
you can define his life: by his

heart. He always gave more
than one hundred percent in his
constant effort to improve him
self and his teammates."

As a person, Chris will
live in our memories as the out
standing human being he was.
He was a true friend in an era
where that quality is fading
fast. He was kind, but always
strong, and he will be missed
dearly.
On Saturday, October
3rd, there will be a 2.6 mile
memorial run to raise money
for a scholarship to be given in
Chris's name. Any and all con
tributions will be greatly appre
ciated. Details about the event
will be forthcoming in the days
ahead.
The sadness that we in
the Gettysburg community feel
is tempered by the joy that we
had in knowing him. I, for one,
am proud to have known Chris
Clifford and to have called him
my friend. I only wish more
people could have had the
same opportunity. And now we
must say goodbye: to the wres
tler, the person, and the friend.
Goodbye Chris. Rest in
Peace.

NCAA tournament for the
eighth time," said Head Coach
Kim Kelly.
The Lady Bullets are fa
vored to win a sixth consecu
tive title, but coach Kelly
knows other teams are trying
to knock them off. "I think that
if we don't watch ourselves,
Franklin & Marshall could sur
prise us," she said.

Key Returning Players: Jason

Outlook: Coming off an 18-3
season, which saw them ad
vance to the NCAA Mid-Atlan
tic regional, the Bullets goals
are simple. "We want to win
the Centennial Conference
Championship and earn an
NCAA post-season bid," said
Head Coach David Wright.
If the Bullets are to ac
complish their goals, they will

need to fill two major voids in
the defense. Goalkeeper and
regional All-American Jon
Katerba left behind a legacy
which includes records for ca
reer wins and shutouts. De
fender Josh Rubinich was a
four-year starter and regional
All-American.
Although Gettysburg has
lost two outstanding players,
they return national All-Ameri
can and 1998 CC Player of the
Year, Jason Vishio. As a junior,
Vishio set the Gettysburg Col
lege record for goals in a sea
son with 22. Joining Vishio on
the front line will be classmate
Chris Pryor, a second team all

turn 10 starters from a 14-3-1
team, which captured the CC
Championship and advanced
to the NCAA tournament.
Those returning include AD
Americans Lauren Frankfrod
(D) and Whitney Jackson (M),
who was named CC Player of
the Year as a sophomore.
"The return of ten start
ing players, with the blend of
promising rookie talent could
be an explosive combination
for this season's success," said
Wawrousek. The only foresee
able problem for the Lady Bul
lets will be to find an adequate
replacement in goal.
The graduation of all-re
gion goalkeeper Beth O'Boyle
leaves a gaping hole at the po
sition. The responsibility could
fall on the shoulders of fresh
man Sarah Fishburne
Fishburne was an all-state se
lection at her high school in
North Carolina.

Gettysburg will aim to
defend the Centennial Confer
ence title, which accompanies
an automatic berth to the
NCAA tournament. With the
core of the '98 team returning,
coach Wawrousek will not
make any major changes.

Outlook: The Lady Bullets aim
to defend their CC Champion
ship with a strong returning

nucleus. With the conference
champion earning an automatic
bid to the NCAA tournament,
league play is more important
this season than it has been in
the past.
The NCAA tournament is
nothing new to Gettysburg. In
the 1998 campaign, they ad
vanced to the second round
before dropping a heartbreaker
to Rowan, 2-1.
"We have a strong return
ing unit of experienced varsity
starters," said Head Coach
Carol Cantele, "plus some ris
ing sophomores that will be
competing for a varsity spot."

Gettysburg returns 31 letterwiners

heading into his 22nd season with the
