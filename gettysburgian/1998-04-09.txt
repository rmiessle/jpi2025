Local residents fired up over "boorish students"

from staff reports
Gettysburg area residents have
formed an organization to deal with
problems caused by Gettysburg College
students living off-campus.
The organization calls itself the
Hazel Alley Association after the east
ernmost boundary of the district that
covers the area from North Stratton
Street to Mummasburg Street.
The Gettysburg Times, last Friday,
in an article titled "'Town-gown' rela
tionship strained by boorish students,"
reported about the growth of the orga
nization, and the problems caused to the
Gettysburg community by college stu
dents living off-campus.
The Hazel Alley Association
counts among its organizers Professor
Samuel Mudd of the College's Psychol
ogy Department. Mudd is a resident

of the Hazel Alley area and an alumnus
of the College.
The Times reported "Walking
tours of various streets in Gettysburg
show the damaging effect that transient
housing is causing. Garbage piles up,
uncollected. Kegs lay strewn about in
a backyard. A fence is partially knocked
down. A jock strap adorns a wrought
iron banister outside a Water Street
house for weeks."
The Association is concerned that
the students living in the neighborhood
will result in a decrease in property val
ues and a decline of a "family atmo
sphere."
Gettysburg Borough Council
President John Eline told The Times
"I'm afraid we're losing the family at
mosphere on the north end of town,"
and promised to bring the issue before
the town council.

Several houses have gone up for
sale in the area, a fact which The Times
seemingly attributes to the student pres
ence. The College usually allows no
more than 200 students to live off cam
pus. This year, however, due to an in
creased student population and the clos
ing of two fraternity houses, a housing
shortage led to the College granting off
campus housing to a greater number of
students.
Assistant Dean of the College
Dennis Murphy has introduced some
new initiatives to deal with the tension
between students and town resident. A
group of 20 students living off-campus
will be selected to serve are representa
tives of the College within the commu
nity. In addition to being required to
be seniors in good academic standing,

the College has instituted a new policy
that prohibits students with disciplin
ary violations from living off-campus.
This will go into effect for the 1999
housing selection process.
The 1997-98 academic year has
seen a rise in large off-campus parties.
The strict enforcement of The College's
B.Y.O.B. alcohol policy, and an under
age drinking incident that led to the
closing of the Phi Delta Theta house,
may be factors in the increase of the off
campus parties.
Borough residents have com
plained that students frequently ignore
fines levied against them by the borough
police for parking, noise, and trash vio
lations. Though fifty percent of the stu
dent body receives financial aid, many
area residents see this as an instance of
wealthy college students ignoring the
concerns of those around them.

Who will it be?
Identity of graduation speaker still uncertain

by Laura Root
Staff Reporter The Gettysburg College Class of
1998's commencement ceremony is
scheduled for Sunday, May 17. Who
will be speaking at the ceremony re
mains a question.
The possibilities for speakers in
clude President Bill Clinton and Mr.
Dick Schultz.
The Commencement Committee
extended a speaking invitation to
Clinton in late October.
Currently, he has neither ac
cepted nor declined. The Committee
calls the White House every Friday for
an update on the situation.
"It isn't out of the ordinary that
he [Clinton] has not responded yet,"
says Jill Trott_, Chairperson of the Com
mencement Committee, "For security
reasons, his schedule is not planned that
far in advance."
In case Clinton does decline the

offer to speak, Dick Schultz has also
been asked to give the talk.
Schultz has accepted and will be
in Gettysburg on May 17 regardless of
Clinton's presence. Schultz is also
scheduled to receive an Honorary
Gettysburg College Degree.
Although not an alumnus of
Gettysburg, Schultz is considered a
"friend of the College." He is a former
member of the Board of Trustees.
Schultz has served as the Executive Di
rector of the NCAA and is currently the
head of the Olympic Committee.
To choose a commencement
speaker, the Senior Class Cabinet and
Commencement Committee work all
year with the Executive Assistant to the
President of the College. Currently, the
position is held by Suzanne Johnson
Flynn. - continued on page 4 -

College community discusses future goals

Debate over new facilities dominates "town meeting"

by Dan Arcari
Technology Manager
On April 2, the Common
Hour featured a special "town
meeting" to inform the campus
community about the physical
structure of the campus. The
presentation covered renova
tions to existing buildings, pos
sibilities for new buildings as
well as landscape issues. The
college has set a 10-15 year
goal, at a price tag of some
$200 million dollars to upgrade
the facilities and environment
of Gettysburg College.
The plans, which have
taken into account suggestions
from the Committee on the
Future, still have to be pre
sented to the Board of Trust
ees for approval.

With the expansion of
Information Resources, the li
brary has seen decreased build
ing space available for its own
purposes. Among various de
partment shiftings, IR may be
moved into a renovated Plank
Hall that would feature stu
dent-oriented departments.
Among these offices would be
academic advising, career plan
ning and advising and the in¬

ternship center. The gym and
fitness areas would be re
moved, and an additional floor
would be added to the top of
the building.
In the College Union
Building, the early plans call for
the removal of the pool which
would be relocated in Bream
Wright Hauser as part of an
addition that would expand the
recreational and fitness facili
ties available to non-athletes on
campus.
A new science building is
also planned, and would incor
porate both the biology and
chemistry departments,
thereby making Bnedenbaugh
available for renovation and
conversion into a freshman
dorm. The new science build
ing would likely be located in
the area behind Masters and
would be part of a new science
quad.

Among the landscaping
issues were plans to remove the
unused pool from Paxton this
summer and replace it with a
small grove of trees. Plans for
"edges, gates and borders" call
for more signs of demarcation
as to where the college's prop
erty actually begins. Among the

more significant of these plans
is a large archway and sign sys
tem to be located on North
Washington Street near Ice
House. Plans are also under
consideration for the removal
of the parking lot at College
Apartments, to be replaced by
a garden and park-type envi
ronment. The issue of campus
parking was not directly ad
dressed in the presentation.
Other topics included
finding a facility in which to
locate the Political Science de
partment once the White
House is turned into an alumni
center. Further renovation of
the freshman and upperclass
dorms, as well as the construc
tion of a new residence all were
important parts of this overall
plan.

The construction of a
new auditorium for the per
forming arts was a topic almost
overlooked in the presentation.
In the question and answer pe
riod following the presenta
tion, several faculty members
and numerous students from
many departments questioned
President Haaland as to why
the construction of a new per
forming arts center received a

low priority on the
administration's overall lists
of goals to be achieved in the
next decade. Faculty and stu
dent pointed out the gener
ally poor quality of our per
forming spaces compared
with similar schools. Few
definite answers were given,
but the availability of funds
and space were cited as prob
lems. Although the adminis
tration seems to favor the
construction of a new sci
ence facility over a perform
ing arts center, the audience
reaction at the end of the

presentation seemed to indi
cate that the campus has op
posite feelings. Almost all of
the forty minutes devoted to
question and answer were
occupied by students and
faculty arguing their case for
a new performance facility.
When the session was ended,
students were still in line at
the microphones. In the af
termath of the meeting, a
petition and letter-writing
campaign were begun to en
courage the administration
to reconsider the issue of
performance space for the
arts.

Sloat leaves legacy of learning
Professor of Chemistry Emeritus dies at 99

by Henry Fawell
Assistant News Editor

the Gettysburg College chem
istry building, was built in his
honor.
Dr. Sloat is one member
of a teaching legacy at
Gettysburg College that
stretches for decades. As a stu
dent here he was taught by Dr.
Breidenbaugh, the professor
after whom the chemistry
building was named. Then, as
a Professor, Dr. Sloat taught Dr.
Alex Rowland, who, in his time
teaching here at the college, has
taught a number of present-day
professors.
"He was a great influence
on a lot of lives," said Dr.
Rowland, "Over many genera
tions, he taught his students a
lot of things. Not just chemis
try, but running a lab, even
photography. He was a real
good man."

Dr. Charles A. Sloat, Pro
fessor of Chemistry for over 40
years at Gettysburg College,
died on April 7 in Gettysburg
Hospital. He was 99.
Sloat was a 1923 gradu
ate of Gettysburg College and
a 1924 graduate of Haverford
College. He received his Ph.D.
from Princeton University in
1930. Sloat served in the U.S.
Army and was a World War II
veteran. He was later military
governor of Landkreis-Co
logne from 1944-1946.
He came to Gettysburg as
an assistant professor in 1927
and, despite a brief intermis
sion in during WWII, taught
until he retired in 1968 as a full
professor. The Sloat Library, in

Dr. Sloat was a 50 year
member and former president
of American Chemical Society
and founding member of Skep
tical Chymist Society. He was
also a member of the Society
of Metals, and the American
Association for the Advance
ment of Science.
Born December 12,1898
in Cashtown, he was the son
of the late J. Walter and Clara
Funt Sloat. He is survived by
his wife of 51 years, Marion
Biggs Sloat.
Funeral services will be
held at 10:00 a.m. Friday, April
10, in Gettysburg College's
Christ Chapel, with Rev. Jef
frey Swanger officiating. Me
morial contributions may be

WZBT turns fifty

Radio station celebrates anniversary
with broadcast from Hallof Fame

from Press Release
The student run, non
commercial radio station of
Gettysburg College, WZBT
91.1 FM, turns fifty years old
this year.
The station began broad
casting in 1948 on AM under
the call letters WWGC.
To celebrate its fiftieth
anniversary, WZBT broad
casted live from the Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame and Museum
in Cleveland, Ohio on Satur
day, April 4, from 9:00 a.m. to
9:00 p.m.
Several WZBT alumni
and over thirty student disc
jockeys broadcasted assorted
formats focusing on the history

of rock and roll.
Station manager Tim
Funk ('00) said, "It's a college
disc jockey's dream to broad
cast live from the Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame, and we are
able to make over thirty
people's dreams come true. It's
our fiftieth anniversary, and we
couldn't ask for a better trip to
celebrate it."
WZBT built a strong re
lationship with the people in
Cleveland last year. In the
spring of 1997, thirty WZBT
disc jockeys went to Cleveland
to broadcast. The station
broadcasted for four hours that
evening, from 5:00 to 9:00
p.m. The trip was very success
ful and everyone wanted to do

it again.
Former Program Di
rector Taryn Losch ('98)
said, "I think it's great the
Hall of Fame gives college
radio DJ the opportunity to
broadcast live from Cleve
land." v
Gettysburg College
has increased its town and
college listenership in recent
years. This increase is due to
a more professionally run
station.
Funk said, "The previ
ous executive board really
took the station to a new
level. I feel that they've built
the foundation for our new
board, which makes the job
a lot easier."

French Department lecture
commemorates Dreyfus Affair

Emile Zola wrote an open let
ter under the heading
'J'accuse" that was published
on the front page of a newspa
per. In the letter, Zola accused
the army of covering up its mis
taken conviction of Dreyfus.
Because of Zola's article, a new
government came to power, the
role of the press was trans
formed, the rule of law and re
spect for truth were more
firmly established in rhe _v na

brought into line, and the in
tellectual class was accorded

In The House!
New co-directors lead Women's Center into tenth year

by Cara Masucci
Staff Reporter Next year, this campus
will celebrate the tenth anniver
sary of the formation of a place
where everyone can go to re
lax, have a good time, and be
treated with respect. This place
is the Women's Center. In ad
dition to its many purely social
apsects, the Center also offers
a wide variety of activities and
programs.
The two new directors of
the Women's Center, junior T.J.
Scott and sophomore Lisa
Wingenroth, hope to build on
the image that the Center can
be a place for relaxing, social
izing, and even watching tele
vision, on top of its other func¬

tions. Over the past ten years
the Women's Center has cre
ated and developed many pro
grams to which the campus

Lisa Wingenroth troth, '00

looks forward. These activities
range from learning lunches
and the annual Women's Con
ference to mocktails on a Fri
day night. They have become
staples of the Gettysburg Col
lege community.
Both Wingenroth and
Scott would like to keep activi
ties like this, as well as add
some new programs that would
be beneficial to the campus.
The two directors have met
several times for training and

are in the initial planning stages
for next year's activities.
The two women would
like to probe deeper into the
issues of diversity in all do
mains, and how to get more
men at Gettysburg College to
take advantage of the Women's
Center. This would add to the
different types of diversity that
range from gender differences
and racial diversity to eco
nomic and social diversity.
Scott and Wingenroth

earned the positions of co-di
rectors after applying earlier
this semester and being se
lected from a highly talented
and active pool of women.
Both Wingenroth and Scott
had been involved with the
Women's Center in the past.
They attended the national
Women's Conference at
Georgetown in Washington
D.C. last summer. Wingenroth
commented that "it [the con
ference] was really exciting."
In addition to the na
tional conference, Wingenroth
was on the planning commit
tee for Gettysburg's own
Women's Conference. Scott
was a housesitter and sat on the
Associates Board at the Center
this past year. Their diverse
backgrounds and experiences
at the Center allows for them
to set their goals on diversity
from a variety of areas.

The women are required
to organize events on such ba
sic issues as sexual violence,
alcohol awareness, AIDS
awareness, and women's
health. The two women do
have some leeway, however,
and hope to work closely with
a variety of people on making
next year a success for the
Women's Center.
Scott would like to see
people form a greater respect
for others and themselves with
help from the Center. At the
Women's Center, she feels
people will be "respected for
their ideas." Her main goal is
to open people up to entirely
different ideas than those they
are used to. Wingenroth and
Scott would like to focus on ex
posing the campus community
to something they may not
have thought of previously.

In addition, as a Women's
Studies major, Scott would like
to see a merging of the
Women's Center and the
women's studies department
into a more cohesive unit. The
Center will also work with In
tercultural Relations to foster
a campus centered on diversity.

T.J. Scott, '99

A major goal of Scott and
Wingenroth is to expose the
Center to everyone on campus.
Both women commented that
they would like to make more
people aware of where the
Women's Center is, and that it
is there for the campus. The
Center has two floors open to
the campus, a conference
room, a television, a computer,
a library for research, as well
as a whole slew of other facili
ties open to anyone who would
like to use them. There are
even guest bedrooms open for
student use.
Both directors have made
it a priority to get men to take
advantage of the Women's
Center. Scott and Wingenroth
feel that sometimes men feel

ostracized by the idea that it is
a Women's Center, but as Scott
comments, "We don't bite!" By
making the Center a social out
let, the co-directors hope to
bring more men to the Center
so they can experience it first
hand. The Center is a place for
everyone.
The women encourage
anyone who wants to experi
ence the Center and get in
volved to do so. It exists not
simply to foster women's ad
vancement in society, but for
furthering the social advance
ment of the entire campus com
munity. It is a place to hang
out and chill, to let loose the
worries of schoolwork, and a
place where respect and fun are
priority.

South of Miami lies a
chain of westward-curving
tropical islands known as the
Florida Keys. A one-lane high
way composed of hundreds of
bridges link the islands of man
grove to the southern coast of
Florida. As bridges fade in the
rear view mirror, civilization
fades too. Travelers to the
Florida Keys become engulfed
in a culture that is unlike any
other in America.
The mingling of the At
lantic Ocean, the Gulf of
Mexico and the clear Carib
bean waters attract a society of
unruly outlaws, festering bums,
philosophical bartenders, and
burgundy-faced fisherman.
Added to the mix are thousands
of American tourists in search
of adventure. All are domes¬

tic-expatriates: men and
women who seek an escape
from restrictive, unimaginative
routine. What better place to
spend a spring break?
Our first view of the Keys
came shortly after leaving the
Miami airport. We were trav-

By the end of the 1970s,
however, Key West surrendered
to capitalism. The tourist in
dustry took over. Chain hotels,
glitzy cruise ships, and cheap T

cal economy. Mainland influ
ence and a flailing fishing in

Despite the changes, Key

much of their tradition, which
keeps the tourists coming.

The magnificent and eccentric
town of Key West, far from
Gettysburg College, lay ahead.
In the late 1960s the is
land reached a pinnacle of out
rageousness: anything was ac
cepted. Writers, singers, hip
pies, gays, and smugglers, all
seeking freedom migrated to
Key West. The outrageous

Dippin' your face off

by Joe Madigan and Petei

Ever since the 1980s,
smokeless tobacco has become
increasingly popular among
young teens, specifically among
young men. It was mostly prac

that throwing a dip in can cause

truth is, when you chew spit
tobacco, you're not just getting

into your blood stream.
What are the health ef
fects? CANCER. Cancer of
the mouth (including the lip,

white, leathery patch to form,
and this is called leukoplakia.
These patches can differ in size,
shape, and appearance. They
can also be pre-cancerous.

EASE. The continu
ous flow of nico
tine into your _^m

beats. Nicotine in the body also
causes constricted blood ves
sels, which can slow down re
action time and cause dizzi
ness—not a good move if you
play sports.
GUM AND TOOTH
DISEASE. Spit tobacco perma
nently discolors teeth. Chew¬

ing tobacco causes bad breath.
Its direct and repeated contact
with the gums causes them to
recede, which can cause your
teeth to fall out. Spit tobacco
con¬

tains ^^
a lot of sugar
which, when mixed with
plaque on your teeth, forms
acid that eats away at tooth
enamel, causes cavities and
chronic painful sores.
Besides those health ef
fects, throwing a dip in can also
put a damper on your social
status. The really bad breath,
discolored teeth, gunk stuck in
your teeth, and constant spit
ting can have a very negative
effect on your social and love
life. An even more serious ef
fect of spit tobacco is oral can
cer; the surgery for this could
lead to removal of parts of your
face, tongue, cheek, or lip.
Early warning signs:
Check your mouth often, look
ing closely at the places where

you hold the tobacco. See your
doctor if you have any of the
following:
1. A sore that bleeds eas
ily and does not heal.
2. A lump or thickening
anywhere in your mouth or
neck.

3. Soreness or
swelling that does not
go away.
4. A red or
white patch that does
not go away_,

Even if you
do

_^ a prob¬
lem today, see your doc
tor or dentist every three
months to have your mouth
checked. Your chances for
fighting the cancer are higher
if you find it early.
So now that you know
the bad news for chewing to
bacco, and are probably wor
ried that your face might end
up very messed up, do some
thing about it and quit before
it's too late! Although kicking
the habit of chewing tobacco is
very difficult (since chewing
tobacco is more addictive than
smoking), it can be done. Re
member, most people do not
start chewing on their own, so
do not try quitting on your

own. Ask for help and posi
tive reinforcement from your
support groups (friends, par
ents, coaches, teachers, whom
ever). You must first think of
reasons why you want to quit.
You may want to quit because
you don't want lip cancer, the
people around you find it of
fensive, you do not want
stained teeth or no teeth, you
do not like being addicted to
nicotine, or you may just want
to start leading a healthier life.
Whatever the reason may be,
chose one and remember it!

Then take some action.
Pick a quit date and throw out
all of your chewing tobacco and
snuff. Ask your friends, family,
teachers, etc., to help you kick
the habit by giving you support
and encouragement. Tell your
friends not to offer you smoke
less tobacco. You may even
want to ask a friend to quit with
you. Find an alternative to
chewing. Chew gum, or eat
sunflower seeds, raisins, or
dried fruits. Find activities to
keep your mind off chewing.
Work out, talk to your friends,

or listen to music. Exercise can
help relieve tension caused by
quitting. Reward yourself by
saving the money you would
have spent on tobacco and buy
something for yourself.
Good luck!

A movie you'd better not miss

by Eileen O Donnell
Movie Columnist
Since its release in 1985,
Better Off Dead has gained a
cult following. This quirky
film stars a very young John
Cusack (Say Anything, Grosse
Pointe Blank) as Lane Meyer.
Lane is an average teen with a
not-soordinary life. His
mom's meals take on a life of
their own. His eight year old
brother, Badger, is building a
rocket ship out of household

In Case You Missed It

appliances. His dad (David
Ogden Stiers of M*A*S*H*)
is a lawyer obsessed with beat
ing the paperboy at his own
game. Lane has all he could
ever wish for in his girlfriend
Beth (Amanda " Wyss, who
broke Judge Reinhold's heart
in Fast Times at Ridgemont
High). After Lane doesn't
make the Greendale High ski
racing team, Beth dumps him
for ski jock Roy Stalin (Aaron
Dozier). Now Lane's world

has fallen apart. He doesn't see
any way he can go on without
Beth. So Lane decides to call it
a life, only his feeble attempts
at suicide are mare comical than
serious.
B u t _BI_^_MHHBHH

through it
all, he has
his pal
Charles de
Mar (Curtis
Armstrong,
best known for
his role as
Booger in
Revenge of
the Nerds)
to help him
along.

There's always a weird best
friend in these movies, it seems.
Charles knows high school
women. After all, he's been a
student at Greendale High for
seven and a half years. He's no
dummy. All Lane has to do, ac
cording to Charles' infinite wis¬

dom, is ski from the K-12.
Making a gnarly run from the
top of the glacier will surely
catch the eye of Beth.
Besides Beth and Roy,
Lane has other problems to

contend with. He is forever
getting challenged to race with
two Korean brothers, one who
speaks no English and one who
learned English from watching
The Wide World of Sports. His
clunky station wagon is no
match for their hot rod, so

Lane is continually left in the
dust. In addition, Lane is also
being harassed by Johnny, the
local paperboy, and his legion
of evil paperboys over a mat¬

ter of two
dollars.
Lane
also has an
admirer
from afar.
Well, from
across the
street,
anyway.
Her name
i s
Monique and she is
a foreign

_^^^^^^^^^^^ exchange
student living with the Smiths,
Lane's neighbors. Mrs. Smith
is quite a character. She spon
sored Monique so that her
weirdo son Ricky (Daniel
Schneider, Dennis from tv's
Head of the Class) who just sits
in the house all day crocheting,

could have someone to play
with. Monique doesn't speak
any English, but Mrs. Smith is
certain that she and Ricky will
learn to speak the international
language of love.
Interestingly enough,
Savage Steve Holland, who
wrote and directed this film,
says that Better Off Dead is par
tially autobiographical. He
started to make depressing
movies after his high school
sweetheart ditched him. His
friends didn't sympathize; they
just laughed. This knowledge
just makes the movie funnier.
Better Off Dead is one of
those movies you'll have to see
again and again because it is so
rich. Watch it with friends who
are quick witted and easily
amused. This film is light and
farcical, quite the opposite of
some of the other 80's high
school flicks. Where The

Breakfast Club is full of teen
angst and social commentary,
Better Off Dead is just a good
time.

CONFLICT & Consensus

True campus treasure

To the Editor

In the last few weeks, I
have had the opportunity and
privilege to attend concerts by
the Chapel Choir, Symphonic
Band, Jazz Ensemble, College
Choir, the Four Scores and
the Christ Chapel Handbells.
I assure those of you who
missed these performances
that you not only missed fine
music-making but indeed the
opportunity to experience the
vibrancy of successful coop
erative efforts in this liberal
arts community.
Emotion, prose, move
ment, music, and light were
given life in many diverse and
wonder-filled ways. These
concerts provided opportuni
ties to support our students
and friends, to support their
directors, who give so much

of their time and themselves to
these ensembles, and the op
portunity to bid farewell to a
respected professor as he con
ducted his last performance of
the College Choir, in essence,
the opportunity to experience
some of the performing arts at
their very best. They were key
examples of what faculty and
some 200 students working
together can accomplish.
As an alumnus of this col
lege (and it's Chapel Choir), a
member of the professional
community, and as a great ad
mirer of our students and fac
ulty in the music program, I
offer my congratulations,
thanks, and appreciation to the
members and directors of the
Christ Chapel Handbells,
Chapel Choir, College Choir,
Symphonic Band, the Four

Scores, and the Jazz Ensemble.
All did a wonderful job, many
doing double and triple duty.
Gettysburg College has
much to be proud of! Not least
of these is our music program,
which is a true jewel in the
College's crown. I urge every
one to avail themselves of the
opportunities our music de
partment offers - if you don't,
you're missing out on some of
the best Gettysburg College has
to offer.
Sincerely,
William Gohl '96

A memory of April 4,
1968—the day Martin Luther
King, Jr., was shot. "It is an
image that comes back to me
every time I think of that day,
April 4, 1968, when Rev. King
was shot." -Samuel Mudd
In both cases, 1 was ac
tually on the Gettysburg Col

that JFK and Martin Luther
King, Jr., were shot with a
sniper's rifle. I remember
exactly when I heard about
President Kennedy: walking
with three colleagues, Paul
Whitley, Charles Platt and
Lou Frank from Glatfelter
Hall to Glatfelter Lodge to
review building plans for
what was to be McCreary

A Moment in history

To the Editor:

Hall. I do not remember the
exact spot where I heard about
Reverend King. It was some
where in the south end of the
basement of Breidenbaugh
Hall, where the Psychology
Department had its first labo
ratories in that year. It was a
Thursday and the department
was about to present Bert
Green from Carnegie-Mellon
University who was speaking to
us about the kinetic depth ef
fect. When that program was
over, I learned that College
Chaplain John Vannorsdall and
President Arnold Hanson had
led a memorial demonstration
group of students and faculty
to the Peace Light on
Mummasburg Road, where

various persons spoke of their
anger and despair.
I caught up with that
group of thirty of so as they
were returning to the campus,
walking off the berm by the
ditch on the east side of the
road. I stood to the side in the
ditch as they straggled by—sub
dued, somber, avoiding eye
contact as they went. Arnold
Hanson and John Vannorsdall
led. It was a warm day and
gray, with a little sun. I joined
the group at the back to finish
the last two hundred yards of
the pilgrimage. When we got
to Lincoln Avenue we went
home, alone.

Loud parties.

Public urination.
Brawls.
College students are
blamed for many of these of
fenses. We are all aware of the
tension between students and
"townies." But now the accusa
tions have gone too far.
Recently, a group of con
cerned citizens formed the Hazel
Alley Association. The aim of
these disgruntled residents is to
bring their grievances to the at
tention of the College and the
Borough.
Although there are a num
ber of problems caused by some
college students, town residents
are too quick to blame every pre
dicament on Gettysburg
undergrads. It is easy to look
around, see what is wrong with
your neighborhood, and blame it
on someone you don't know and
have no connection to. Residents
should not be so hasty to accuse
all college students.
The College administra
tion, particularly Residence Life
and Greek Life, are as much to
blame as any individual student.
By not harshly punishing those
who blatantly break the policies
set forth by the College, they en
able, and indeed encourage, this
repugnant behavior.
For example, two fraterni¬

ties were denied the use of their
houses by the College this year.
Rather than facing severe conse
quences, the brothers were al
lowed to continue their repulsive
lifestyles off campus.
By condoning such activi
ties, these offices make the Col
lege and its students appear to be
a bunch of reckless rascals. The
rules and regulations are no good
unless enforced; when they go
ignored it reflects badly each and
every one of us.
It is important to note as
well that not all of Gettysburg's
problems are caused by college
students.
On any given night of the
week large groups of obnoxious
high school students can be found
wondering the streets of Gettys
burg. They are just as loud and
violent as any group of college
students. Yet residents are not
giving any attention to the masses
of delinquents weekly haunting
such popular hangouts as gas sta
tion parking lots and vacant alley
ways. Some college students are
the beasts citizens make them out
to be. These individuals should
be punished strictly. However,
residents should not be so quick
to blame the entire campus com
munity for the faults of a few.
Most students are not the mon
sters many "townies" imagine.

CONFLICT & Consensus
This Side of Cynicism

Forget the president
by LA. Isherwood
Columnist As I was walking across
our campus, desperately trying
to think of a topic for my col
umn, I observed a group of stu
dents talking and complaining
about apathy with lethargic
looks on their faces and bad
language. It seems as though
this one little word causes more
grief to so many people on our
campus than any other. Apa
thy itself is a marvelous word
for it is only six letters long but
a whole whopping three syl
lables to pronounce. Thus it is
the little big word, or the little
giant (to use a historical anec
dote) of the great word king
dom.

As I eavesdropped a
scheme came into my head of
how to make this place a little
more efficient. In my estima
tion leadership in these matters
is from the top down, so I pro-

and the dean, bring
pose a few changes to our ad
ministration for the most pro
ductivity possible (mind my
choice of words for I am not
suggesting by any means better
administrators from an ethical
standpoint).
The highest office on our
campus is the President of the
College who probably takes
more criticism daily than Bill
Clinton does in a whole year
from the National Organiza
tion of Women. My suggested
replacement for this role is
none other than the Duke,
that's right John Wayne the
"greatest" American to ever
cross the Rio Grande and kill
lots of people. The Duke
would force us all to get along
or else we'd get a good horse
wuppin' or end up under the
sole of his boot.
within a few weeks he'd
have everyone's Beamers or
Ford Explorers taken away and
we'd all be given a pair of cow-

in the Duke and the
boy boots and a Stetson hat to
compensate. Why? Because
that's all the Duke ever needed
to beat up lots of people and
steal their horses. Hell, he
didn't even need the boots, and
he sure wouldn't need them to
take our campus.
We would all have to
learn the hard way. No more
sissy little pens and paper for
our academics, with John
Wayne you are in the How to
Be a Cowboy So You Can
Smoke Yourself to Death
school. Instead of reading
Hawthorne we all will be re
quired to memorize Will
Rodgers quotes and stupid pick
up lines so we can always ride
into the sunset with some dame
(or fella') across our saddles.
Could we complain? No,
complaints are illegal. The
Duke would ruff us into shape
so that we would fill the boots
of that quintessential American
ideal he left us with.
For Dean of the College

Chairman of the Board

we could appoint none other
than Frank Sinatra. In addition
to sound advice about how to
offend everyone in a given
room at the same time, he
could provide free concerts. If
you had a problem and went
to "Old Blue Eyes," sure
enough he'd reply "shut that
landfill you call a mouth and
get outa my office. What?
Whadda you looking at? Are
you stupid or what?" That
might seem a little harsh but
when Frankie opens his mouth
all can be forgotten within his
melodic voice. Frankie can
make us all feel a little more
humble as he publicly harasses
us and humiliates almost every
one he sees. Who needs books
when you've got to the Frankie
school of hard knocks. The
best part of it is that Frankie
will appoint his old pal from
stage and screen Dean Martin
as head of all campus parties.
Drinks are on the house when
Dino's tending bar.

With these tough guys
Gettysburg College can remedy
the apathy bug and we all can
lead more "efficient" lives.
Maybe we could even find a job
for Sammy Davis Jr. and
Humphery Bogart. That way
we can cover all of the bases.
Maybe even get Ernest
Hemingway as head of the
Writing Center to lecture on
how to be miserable your
whole life and write real good
too. There is no end to the pos
sibilities. With these
showboaters we could have an
all star cast of administrators
and be the envy of every real
American institution. It might
not be the most enjoyable col
lege experience, but at least we
won't have to worry about hav
ing nothing to do or being lazy.
Maybe in my next column I'll
place J.P. Morgan as the head
of the economics department,
and Karl Marx as head of the
College republicans just for
laughs.

For the past two semes
ters, we, like most students at
Gettysburg College, have sim
ply READ The Gettysburgian,
while not contributing to its
production. At the Editor of
the Opinions call to response
in his article found in the April
2 edition of the paper, we have
decided to break our silence.
First and foremost, this
letter is NOT a collection of
complaints, similar to many of
the articles that have been pub
lished recently. That is not to
say that we think people should
be restricted in expressing their
concerns about campus issues.
However, it is one thing to dis
cuss an important issue such as
the overlapping of departmen
tal programs (as Dr. Janet Pow
ers did two weeks ago); it is
quite another thing to take an
entire article to complain about
air conditioning (or lack there

Proof someone is reading

To the Editor

of). As Michael Petro pointed
out in his article entitled "Town
Meeting...", some people are
tired of hearing the "I pay
$30,000 to go here..." excuse.
We all know this amount seems
extremely high and often ex
cessive, which it may very well
be. At the same time, does the
"air conditioning dilemma"
improve in anyway when it is
repeatedly addressed in one
single issue of The Gettysburg
ian} One would think that con
tacting Facilities Services would
help to rectify the situation suf
ficiently. If not, and this awful
problem remains, we need to
consider one thing: How vital
is air conditioning in the pro
gression of out health and hap
piness anyway? Personally, we
don't have air conditioning at
our homes, and some people
don't even have homes (We
mention this because we are

involved in "Habitat for Hu
manity" -anyone interested in
helping can contact us). De
spite the lack of an environ
mentally harmful luxury, we
seemed to have turned out o.k.
in the long run. Arguing that
you aren't getting your
money's worth in your educa
tion (determined by artificial
cold air in April) seems a bit
petty. We also want to comment
about a point well made by
Petro about respect. We ac
knowledge that it is not only
members of our campus com
munity whose level of respect
seems to be dwindling (these
days, it seems like it's occurring
everywhere...), but he success
fully brings to light something
that we have often considered
ourselves. For example, who
has seen what the mailroom
looks like after lunch? Instat¬

ing that students here: "...
throw trash around expecting
the hard working men and
women of Facilities Services to
clean it up," Petro makes a valid
claim on the general laziness of
students who can't seem to find
the recycle bin (which, by the
way, is two feel away). Basi
cally, we feel that those students
who complain should be the
ones taking the initiative to
demonstrate positive actions
and consideration to everyone
and every THING.
There are many other is
sues that concern us. However,
as we said, we don't want to
gripe when it seems as though
there will be no positive results.
We enjoy reading The Gettys
burgian and hope to see more
articles focused on ways that
students can contribute more
beneficially to the campus com
munity. Perhaps we would sug¬

gest for The Gettysburgian to
become a better outlet for
learning about happenings out
side of Gettysburg, as well as
to contain more substantial ar
ticles about campus programs,
such as speakers (there are so
many each week that one indi
vidual could never attend them
all). We support free speech
and free expression, otherwise
we would not be able to write
this letter. It would be nice to
think that people care more
about the world at large and
want to take an ACTIVE role
in resolving whatever they may
feel are imperative issues.
However, simply reevaluating
you own position in this soci
ety we share would be enough.

CONFLICT & Consensus
The Pachyderm's Pulpit
Welcoming an American treasure

by John Dunlap
Political Columnist
On April 13th Gettysburg
College will host a piece of
American history, the former
United States Senate Majority
Leader, the Honorable Robert
Dole. Senator Dole for nearly
a half century has dedicated his
life to public service from his
service in the United States
Army during World War II, to
being the 1996 Republican
Nominee for the Presidency of
United States.
Most of us know Senator
Dole from his run for president
during the last presidential
election but Bob Dole's most
lasting legacy may be as one of
the greatest members of the
United States Congress.

Bob Dole was born and
raised in almost the exact
middle of the continental
United States, Russell, Kansas.
Bom in 1923, Dole's childhood
was not easy. He lived with his
father, Doran and his mother,
Bina, along with a brother and
two sisters during the dust bowl
and the Great Depression. Life
was not easy, but the Dole's
made it through. Bob excelled
in sports.
In 1941, Bob Dole
headed off to Kansas State Uni
versity, but World War II called.
Dole served in the Tenth
Mountain Division in Italy
where he was severely
wounded. At first the doctors
did not believe that Dole would
live, then they did not believe
he would be able to walk, but
he proved them wrong. Bob
Dole lost the use of one of his
arms but he returned to college
and eventually received a law
degree from Washburn Univer¬

sity. Right out of law school
Bob Dole was elected to the
Kansas State Legislature as a
Republican representing his
hometown. From 1953 to
1961 he was the Russell
County State Attorney and, in
1960, Dole was elected to Con
gress. From 1961 to 1969 Bob
Dole served in the United States

House of Representatives. Vot
ing wise Bob Dole was a con
servative but he almost always
did what was right. In 1964,
for instance, he supported the
historic Civil Rights Bill. In
1968, Bob Dole moved over to
the Senate where he served for
the next 27 and a half years.

This new senator from
Kansas was a strong defendei
of farmers, veterans and the
disabled. Three groups he
cared deeply about and that
were very personal to
him. Senator
Dole also _^^^^mm
became _^^^^^^^^H
a _^^^^^_K_^^^
strong _^_A^^r j_^^B_^
_.Ls

dent Richard Nixon and in
1971 the President appointed
him Chairman of the Republi
can National Committee. This
was a very difficult time for
Dole as he and his wife di
vorced. They had one daugh
ter, Robin, who has always re
mained close to her father.
In 1974, with the
Watergate Scandal and the res
ignation of President Nixon, re
publicans were in trouble. Bob
Dole was in the fight of his po
litical life and was narrowly re
elected to Congress. Follow
ing the election, Dole married
Elizabeth Hanford, a member
of the Federal Trade Commis
sion. Dole soon entered the na¬

tional stage when in 1976,
presidential nominee Gerald
Ford, was looking for a running
mate. Vice President Nelson
Rockefeller was not seeking the
nomination and the president
who just fended off a chal
lenge from the former
conservative Gover
nor of Califor
nia, Ronald _^^
Reagan _^^^^^^

_^m redd
_^^r some -
_y one to
appeal to
Reagan
supporters.
Senator
Dole was his
man, as he be
came the
1976 Republi
can Nominee
for the Vice

Presidency of the United States.
Dole campaigned hard for the
GOP ticket and was accused of
being the hatchet man. The
funny very personable Bob
Dole did not come out in the
first ever Vice Presidential De
bate between Dole and Sena
tor Walter Mondale of Minne
sota. In the end he came across
as too aggressive. The Ford
Dole ticket made a strong
comeback but was defeated by
the Democratic team of Jimmy
Carter and Walter Mondale.
Four years later, Bob
Dole tried for the Republican
Nomination for the Presidency
himself, but Ronald Reagan be
came the nominee, defeating

Dole and future president
George Bush. Dole was re
elected to the Senate and be
came Chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee. In that
position Dole helped enact the
Reagan agenda and in 1982
worked to save Social Se
_ curity. 1985
_^^^^^^. was the

_^^ H_^^^^ begin
^^_T ^^^k n i ng
_^ _T _^H of Bob
_y _^^^^ M Dole's
_^K/^^^^^^ m time as
_^^^^^^^W the Re
^^^^^^^^w
publican
_^^^^^^^r Leader of
^^^^^ the Senate.
^^^_r For the next
11 and half years
Dole served as the
GOP Leader. From
I 1985 to 1987 he served
as Senate Majority Leader
and from 1987 to 1995

Dole served in the opposition
as Minority leader. With the
historic republican takeover of
Congress in 1994, Senator
Dole returned to the majority.
Following his reelection
in 1986, Bob Dole made an
other effort to win the GOP
Presidential Nomination. In
1988, Dole was the main op
position to Vice President
George Bush. Dole defeated
Bush in the Iowa Caucus but
was defeated in a tough New
Hampshire primary. After that,
it was all down hill as George
Bush won the nomination and

the election.
As president, George
Bush found Bob Dole to be one
of his most loyal supporters.
Mrs. Dole served in the Bush
Cabinet as the Secretary of La
bor. Before that she had served
as Ronald Reagan's Secretary of
Transportation. In 1991, she
left the Administration to work
as President of the American
Red Cross. During this period
Bob Dole battled prostate can
cer and re-election at home.
Like always, however, the
people of Kansas returned their
senator to Washington. This
time for a fifth term into the
Senate.
With Bill Clinton's elec¬

tion to the Presidency in 1991
Senator Dole returned to the
national spotlight uniting re
publicans against the Clinton
agenda.
In 1995, it was Bob Dole_,
along with House Speaker
Newt Gingrich, who fought for
a balanced budge.
It was in 1995 that Bob
Dole decided he had one more
mission, another run for presi
dent. Dole, this time was the
frontrunner and after a scare in
the New Hampshire primary,
Bob Dole at the age of 73 fi
nally became the Republican
Nominee for the Presidency of
the United States.
Before the Republican
National Convention, Senate
Majority Leader Dole resigned
from Congress to dedicate all
of his time to running for presi
dent.

With the former Secre
tary of Housing and Urban De
velopment Jack Kemp as his
running mate the Dole cam
paign ran into tough times. Ir
one of the most negative in
cumbent presidential cam
paigns in history, the Clinton
campaign bombarded Bob
Dole. Once again in the na
tional spotlight the real Bob
Dole did not shine through and
in the end by a margin of 49%
to 41% President Clinton de
feated Citizen Dole.
Bob Dole's campaign for
President was special to me.
I was on the floor of the
Republican National Conven
tion in San Diego, California to
see him accept his Presidential
Nomination and on few occa
sions I have had the honor to
meet both Senator and Mrs.
Dole. I found Bob Dole to be
funny and very genuine.

It was an honor to see
him address the Republican
National Convention and it
was an honor to cast my first
ever vote in a Presidential Elec
tion for a man who I consider
a true American hero.
I urge everyone to come
out a welcome this great man
to our campus. This is a real
honor. Welcome Senator Dole
and thank you!

For more than three decades, fans have been getting high on the music of Merl Saunders. His repertoire runs the gamut from funk to
blues to rock to jazz, and most recently new age but his audience is not concerned with musical genres; "It's the vibe that counts," he
says. Merl has shared the stage and studio with the likes of Harry Belefonte, Lionel Hampton, B.B. King, Miles Davis, the Statler
Brothers, Paul _Butterfield, and of course, his beloved buddy, Jerry Garcia, whom he still lovingly referstto as "Jerome." Even bands like
Phish and Blues Traveler, with whom he frequently jams or sits in, have fallen under the spell of Merl Saunders. Merl's albums "Save
the Planet So We'll Have Some Place to Boogie", "Blues From the Rainforest", and his latest "Fiesta Amizonica" show his dedication to
the environment.

Sho'men and Fords fall victim to Bullet barrage

by Bill Davidson
Staff Repot to
The women's softball
team enjoyed a 4-0 record last
week, sweeping Washington
College on Thursday and
Haverford College on Satur
day. The Lady Bullets are now
15-4 overall and 6-0 in the
Centennial Conference, earn
ing them a tie for first place
with Dickinson.
In the first game Thurs
day, Angle Hoptak recorded a
7-4 win, allowing 4 runs (3
earned) on 5 hits. A balanced
offensive attack, which saw
four Bullets enjoy multi-hit
games, was lead by Traci Bul
lock, who went 2 for 3 with a
triple and two RBI.

The Bullets broke open a
tight second game with a three
run third inning. Jen White
provided a spark, scoring 2
runs on 2 triples. Erin Killeen
also contributed a steady bat,
going 2 for 2 with 2 RBI. Sa
rah Stokes pitched 7 strong in
nings to record the 6-2 win.

In Ha\erfoid, the Gettys
buig women trounced the
Fords 15-4, with the hitting of
Karyn Miller and Sara
Gravelme. Miller went 4 tor 5
with 4 RBI, including a double
and a triple. Gravehnc was a
double sh\ of the cycle, going
3 for 3 with 6 RBI. Suzanne
Dailey pitched 4 and 2/3 in
nings to record the win, and
Melissa Hazzard finished the
game with a scoreless 1 and 1/
3. The second game was no

different as the Lady Bullets out
slugged the Fords 16-7. Jen
White stole the show in this
one, going 4 for 4, with 2 hom
ers and 6 RBI.
White's performance
earned her the honor of Cen
tennial Conference Athlete of
the Week. She batted .688 (11
for 16) for the week, hitting
one double, two triples, and
two home runs. In the process,
White tied Gettysburg school
records for home runs (2) and
RBI (6) in a single game.
Thus far, Karyn Miller
leads the offensive attack with

How about a little hit and run?
down to first.
a .549 batting average. Jen
White is close behind, batting
.524 with a .857 on base per
centage and five stolen bases.
Jess Rising has added speed to
compliment the hitting, steal
ing 7 bases in the season.
Shortstop Sara Gravelme and
Jill Murphy have assisted the
Bullet pitching staff, pounding

While her teammate slides into third Sara Graveline hustles

a wall in the middle infield.
Suzanne Dailey leads the
team with a record of 4-0,
while Sarah Stokes has hurled
her way to a 3-0 record and a
microscopic 0.94 era. Angie
Hoptak has won her last 3
starts and the Katelyn Gorton/
Melissa Hazzard tandem has
combined for a 5-0 record,

mainly in relief.
The Lady Bullets have 3
home doubleheaders remain
ing. The women play host to
Ursinus and Muhlenberg on
consecutive Saturdays, April
1 lth and 18th, before the Mes
siah Falcons, a perennial pow
erhouse, invades Gettysburg on
Thursday April 23rd.

The Bunny is back; and he better have brought baseball

by Steve Jenkins
Sports Editor
Ah, it's Easter again.
Time for that bunny to come
hippity-hopping through the
fields to give out candy to all
the little boys and girls who
really do not need another
candy bar. Along with the an
noying rabbit comes something
as sweet and pure as a new
born child: BASEBALL SEA
SON. Do you smell that? No,
it is not the stupid easter bunny
carry any chocolate eggs. NO.
It is the sweet aroma of a
freshly cut infield, hot dogs,
and popcorn that make the
opening of this glorious base
ball season truly unique.
The players are done cry¬

ing over salary arbitration and
are primed and ready for their
attack run at this year's pen
nant. Time to watch Ken
Griffey Jr. make another run at
Maris' 61, and to sit back and
relax as Greg Maddux pitches
his way into Cooperstown.
"Well, Steve," you com
plain, "baseball is boring. I
would rather throw stones at
myself than watch baseball."
Well, I have some things that
could make baseball games a
little more exciting, for both
guys and girls.
Guys. We all love base
ball. But still some of us feel
that if the game was a taco it
could definitely use some
tabasco. Through careful
thought, investigation, inter
view, and analysis, I have come

up with some improvements
just for us guys.
Though baseball is the
epitomy of perfection, there
are some ways in which they
could better entertain the fans.
How many guys would show
up to a game if supermodels
wandered around the stadium
randomly locking lips with
fans? Wouldn't you go?
Or how about a free steak
to the male fan who can yell
the loudest obsenities at oppos
ing fielders? Lots of people
would pay good money if they
knew that they could come to
the ball park and get sides of
beef for being rambuncious.
Wouldn't you?
Or finally, free nachos
and beer during the seventh
inning stretch to the fan who

can belch the tune to "Take me
out to the ball game." Sounds
promising.
Ladies, Ladies. Would
you go to a ball game if all of
the players were forced to wear
extra tight pants revealing their
round, yet athletic buttocks?
That would be incentive, right?
How about free
babysitting of the kids for the
wife who can recall the actual
number of times that her hus
band has told his favorite team
he loves them instead of tell
ing her he loves her? Money.
Ladies what about the ul
timate in incentives: an all ex
penses paid night with
Leonardo DiCaprio to the fe
male baseball enthusiast who
can eat 5 hotdogs, a box of
crakerjacks, a pretzel, and chug

a soda before her husband?
Marvelous. Now what woman
in her right mind would not go
to see the Phillies versus the
Mets if it meant meeting Leo?
None, and attendance would
skyrocket.
So, although watching
baseball is like watching T.S.
Eliot compose poetry, baseball
fans can sometimes be bored.
Write to your favortie major
league team and tell them that
the easter bunny is here, and
he needs some hot dogs.

Bullets shoot-down Fords but are pecked by Gulls

by Henry Fawell
Assistant News Editor
For the second consecu
tive week, the Gettysburg
men's lacrosse team racked up
a decisive victory early on, but
failed to win the big game
against the weekend's high
profile' opponent. Thus,
Wednesday's 23-7 drubbing of
Haverford College proved
short-lived, as No. 4 ranked
Salisbury State buried the Bul
lets at Musselman Stadium on
Saturday under the score 16-9.

Wednesday's victory
against Haverford gave fans
every indication of a big week.
Despite a slow start, which
found the Bullets up only 4-3
after one period, ten players
were able to score for the Bul
lets as they outshot their oppo
nent 63 to 25 by game's end.
The Bullets' starting at
tack made sure to help them
selves to the net, as they com
bined to score ' 16 of
Gettysburg's 23 goals, while
handing eight assists.

Jamie Bateman and Ross
Garretson each scored seven
goals, marking the first time in
schpol history two players have
accomplished the feat in the
same game. Bateman tied his

career high, while Garretson
topped his previous best of five,
set earlier this season. '
Scott Lowery provided
yet another solid performance,
ringing the net twice and dish
ing out three assists. The senior
captain has now contributed at
least a goal or an assist in 26
consecutive games, dating all
the way back to the 1996 sea¬

son. Brian Abbot, the junior
defenseman known around the
league for his defensive skills,
added yet another dimension to
his game as he ripped in his first
career goal.
But Wednesday's mo
mentum failed to carry into the
weekend, as national power
house Salisbury State put an
end to the dramatics that have
typified past matches with Get
tysburg. Since 1996, three of
the four meetings between the
two teams have ended in one
goal games, including last
year's overtime victory for the
Bullets in the NCAA tourna
ment. The Sea Gulls, 8-1 in'98,
jumped out a 2-1 advantage in
the first minute of play. By the
time Jamie Bateman scored the
Bullets' first goal, Salisbury had
stormed out in front 7-1. Get
tysburg came within four goals

of Salisbury in the second quar
ter, but could not solve the Sea
Gull offense, which tallied the
highest scoring output against
the Bullets all year.
Jamie Bateman again led
the Bullets in scoring as he
notched three assists in the loss.

Making a run at the opposing goal Jamie Bateman (11), Scott Lowery (5) and Kevin Callahan
(6) hustle for a loose ball.

Cote, who is just back from
ankle surgery, contributed two
goals as well.
While the Bullets' record
stands at only 4-3, every loss
has come at the hands of a team
ranked in the top 6 of Division
III. This Saturday's matchup
against 4th ranked Washington

College will prove crucial in the
race for the Centennial Confer
ence crown, as well as the
season's final standings. But
until then, the Bullets will have
to settle with the No. 9 rank
ing in Division III, a spot they
presently share with Cortland
State.

The women's tennis team
began the season with a Spring
Break trip to Hilton Head. The
members of the team that went
on the trip were Masako
Yoshida, Tara Schmitt, Bev
Freda Jackson, Laura Bauer,
Emily Glatfelter, Kay
ConFrancesco, Jodi Schmidt,
Lisa Martilotta, Eileen Fortune
and Catherine Peters.
The team was very suc
cessful in South Carolina, post
ing 4-1 record. The only loss
came to George Mason. The
trip and tennis combined were
great preparation for the up
coming season. Thus far the
team is doing well and is unde
feated. A variation in line-up
due to injury and absence was
the case for the first few
matches of the season.

The opening match of the
season was against York Col
lege where the Lady Bullets
posted a 9-0 victory. Yoshida
led the team at first singles,
Jackson in 2nd, Bauer in 3rd,
Goodall in 4th, CoFrancesco in
5th and Glatfelter in the 6th
singles spot.
York forfeited #6 singles
and #3 doubles. The next two
matches versus Catholic Uni
versity and Muhlenburg were
a success for the Bullets with

9-0 and 8-1 victories, respec
tively. The earliest big match of
the season was against
Dickinson.
Tara Schmitt had a very
successful and strong return to
the line-up. The doubles teams
of Yoshida and Schmitt at #1,
Bauer and Glatfelter at #2 and
Jackson and Goodall at #3
swept the doubles, giving the
Bullets a sizable lead going into
single matches. One of the
most anticipated matches of the
season had the Bullets facing
Washington College.
The highlighted match
up of Masako Yoshida vs.
Annabel Flores proved to be
excellent tennis. Gettysburg
once again was victorious, post
ing an 8-1 victory over these
conference rivals. Since the
Bullets have defeated Bryn
Mawr College 9-0 and just yes
terday defeated Johns Hopkins
8-1.

The team is having a great
season with a 12-1 season
record. Singles and doubles
have been successful with
Yoshida and Schmitt teaming
up to make one of the stron
gest teams in the conference
and the team of Jackson and
Goodall are continuing their
win streak from last spring.
Next week will prove to be a
huge week for the Lady Bullets,
so come out and support their
rally to victory.

The niens tennif. team is
also in the midst of a great sea
son. The men opened up the
season with a victory over Mes
siah. Brandon Cutter led the
team at 1st singles, Chris
Rippey in 2nd, Wes Wells in
3rd, Pat Delaney in 4th, Dan
Vesci in 5th, and Chris Budden
in the 6th singles position.
Next, the men's tennis team
took on conference rivals
Haverford, Dickinson, and
Washington.
The men were successful
versus Haverford and
Dickinson, but fell to a strong
Washington College team.
The doubles play from the Bul
lets has been solid with Cutter
and Wells at #1, Rippey and
Delaney at #2 and Budden and
Vesci at #3. Ben Andreozzi
has also returned to singles and
doubles play this season after
coming off knee surgery last
year.

The men are about mid
way through the season. Johns
Hopkins is on the agenda this
week which should prove to be
a good match.
We wish them luck in the
following week and commend
them on their season thus far.
Their overall record of 6-2 is
indicative of their strong sea
son. The men's and women's
tennis teams are both coached

Destined for Vic-TORY; Lodge shows her stuff on field and in training room

member Tory Lodge is a returning
senior on the women's lacrosse
team, which is doing very well
right now with a record of 4-2
overall, and 4-1 in the confer
ence. Tory commented, "Ev
erything is really coming to
gether for us." They seem to

have a promising future with
such a young team this year,
only 3 seniors and 2 juniors.
Tory played lacrosse through
out high school, and was actu
ally a representative for the
state of Pennsylvania in the na
tional tournament.
The thing that is so inter
esting about Tory is that she is
an athlete as well as a student
trainer. She isn't able to do
much training when she is play
ing lax, but says that it is diffi
cult to be "in season" all year
long. "Most people don't seem
«*tQ_*j£alize that athletic training
takes up even more time than
actually playing a sport."
Tory loves training and
competing. She sees it as an
added bonus because if her
team's trainers aren't around,

everyone can come to her for
help, which she doesn't mind a
bit. "Being a trainer has al
lowed me to meet even more
people on campus that I never
would have otherwise," she
explained.
"I love my team—we all
get along so well and it's an
amazing feeling to experience
earned success with great
friends." This is what Tory
loves most about lacrosse. She
is grateful for the open-arm
welcome that she received af
ter returning from her semes
ter abroad last spring.
Tory was amazed at how
accepting the team was of her,
and the fact that not a single
teammate held a grudge. La
crosse has given her many
memories which she will al¬

ways carry with her. These
memories makes Gettysburg's
lacrosse program so worth
while. Tory kept coming back
for more, year after year, and
it was interesting to discover
her incentive.
"Besides my teammates,
it is defense that kept me com
ing back year after year! It's
the best feeling, making an in
terception, denying my girl the
ball, preventing her from go
ing around the crease...I swear,
I must have been born a de
fender because I love it so
much."
Tory once told me that
many people don't ever realize
that she is a lacrosse player. I
was curious to know why, and
wondered if it bothered her.
She said, "It doesn't bother me

at all. I think it's because we
defenders don't get the stats
everyone hears about. This is
fine by me—we all know how
much we contribute to the
team's success. We don't need
outside recognition to under
stand this."
Tory is also involved in
several other activities on cam
pus such as Alpha Delta Pi, and
the Student Trainer's Club
where she is the clubs secretary
She was just recently nomi
nated for Phi Beta Kappa.
Tory has accomplished a
phenomenal amount. There are
few student-athletes who
would be able to manage as
busy a schedule. Tory, we com
mend you for your efforts and
your accomplishments both on
and off the field.

Hitting the "Jake-pot"

One of the finest athletic carrers in the history of Gettysburg College is finally coming to a
close, but none of the students on this campus would trade any of the memories Jake Dell
gave them...not even for a million dollars.

tournaments which enabled
him to compete in the National
Division III Wrestling Champi
onships his sophomore, junior
and senior years. Due to Dell's
outstanding sixth, second and
fourth place finishes, respec
tively, at the National tourna
ment each year, he was a named
a three time All-American.
Despite all that Jake Dell
has accomplished he is still one
of the most humble and warm

It all began twelve years
ago when Jake Dell's older
brother Troy began his wres
tling career. The older Dell
would come home after prac
tice and spend hours teaching
his little brother various wres
tling moves.
Immediately a passion for
the sport was instilled in Jake.
That passion and love of wres
tling, given to Jake by his older
brother and closest friend, has
shaped him into the person he
is today.
Jake attributes all his suc
cesses to his coach of twelve
years, his brother Troy. "He has
taught me everything I know,"

Dave Wilson would not be re
turning to Gettysburg. Jake
and his fellow teammates were
nervous about the transition
and were hoping that the pro
gram would remain the same.
The team was very lucky to
have Coach Wilson's shoes
more than amply filled by Troy
Dell, Jake's first and now last
coach.
Troy returned to Gettys
burg, where he had been an

Jake commented.
"Jake is so successful be
cause of his work ethic and
ability to stay focused on goals
over a long period of time,"
Troy explained. "He has ac
complished really great things."
As soon as Jake was big
enough to wrestle with his
older brother, Troy worked
with him to help make Jake the
talented wrestler he is. Most
importantly Troy instilled con
fidence in Jake. He explained,
"I always believed in him and
when he first came to college I
told him it's never loo early to
win here. I now hear him tell
ing the younger wrestlers the
same thing."

"Wrestling has definitely been
a way of life for me. It shaped
the person I am today. It taught
me hard work, to set goals for
myself, how to win, and how
to loose," Jake explained. "But,
most importantly, it gave me a
sense of what I can do as a per
son and what I can accom
plish." Reflecting on his years at
Gettysburg, Jake talked about
the constant support he felt

from the campus community.
This season as he was prepar
ing for nationals, Jake was re
ally amazed at all the support
and well wishes he received
from the campus. "It was re
ally great knowing I was going
out there with so many people
behind me. The support was
another driving force for me."
The continual support
from Gettysburg's campus is
nothing new to Jake. As a first
year student, Dell won the Cen
tennial Championship at 158
lbs. The tournament that year,
which was held at Gettysburg,
remains one of Jake's fondest
Lind most vivid wrestling
memories.
In the finals Dell was to

people you will ever meet. As
former Gettysburg wrestling
coach Dave Wilson com
mented, "Jake is one of the
most respectful, courteous and
nice young men I ' ve ever
known."
According to Troy Dell,
Jake is extremely dependable
and always willing to help
people. Jake is a very dedicated
athlete who never allowed his
social life to get in front of his
wrestling career. Dell also
found a wonderful balance be
tween his academics and ath
letics, and was therefore able
to succeed in both.
This August, the Bullet
wrestlers found themselves
without a coach, as Coach

assistant coach Jake's sopho
more year, to coach his former
team and also his younger
brother, Jake, in his very last
year of wrestling. "Troy was the
first person I wanted to get the
job," explained the younger
Dell. "He has always been my
coach and I felt really comfort
able having him here." The
transition from brothers to
coach and athlete was easily
made by the Dell brothers. "It
was an excellent opportunity
for me both professionally and
personally," explained Coach
Troy Dell. "I had the ability to
be with Jake for one last year."
In twelve years of compe
tition, Jake has gained an enor
mous amount from wrestling.

It was never too early for
Jake to win at Gettysburg. He
began his tremendous winning
career the very first season he
stepped out onto Gettysburg's
mats. Jake holds the record for
the most pins in a season (17)
and has repeatedly broken his
own record for most wins in a
season, which he bettered to 40
this season. Dell is one of only
two Centennial Conference
wrestlers to have ever claimed
four consecutive conference
titles. In addition, the 167 Ib.
senior wrestler has won three
consecutive NCAA Regional

*_fc

wrestle an opponent who had
beaten him earlier in the sea
son. With three seconds left in
the third period Jake was down
by one point. He escaped to
tie up the match and secured
the conference title in double
overtime. "It was really nice to
have the home crowd advan
tage," he explained. The
people of Gettysburg stood be
hind Jake and wished him well,
just as they did this past sea
son. If you listen closely you
can still hear them cheering.
Wrestling has been a
staple in Jake Dell's life.
Though Jake has finished his

career as an athlete, the sport
has not seen the last of Jake
Dell. If all works out, and Troy
Dell, who filled an interim po
sition this season, is asked back
to coach the Bullets, Jake will
remain at Gettysburg next year
as the assistant wrestling coach.
"I feel myself making the
transition from athlete to
coach," Jake explained. "I
didn't leave [my wrestling ca
reer] with an empty feeling, but
the feeling of a start of some
thing new." Jake hopes to re
turn to Gettysburg in the fall
in order to help the Bullet wres
tlers attain all their goals.

Coaching together would
be another step in the progres
sion for the Dell brothers. "It
would be great," concluded
Troy, "Jake is the person I con
sult with a lot now as it is."
The Dell brothers have
now come full circle. Twelve
years ago Troy Dell taught Jake
Dell every wrestling move he
knew, having no idea as he
coached his little brother that
one day he would have the op
portunity to coach that not-so
little brother on the collegiate
level. Another chapter is now
closed in the wrestling career
of Jake Dell. But the book is
far from over, and one thing is
certain, no matter what hap
pens, with Jake Dell as the
hero, the ending is sure to be
great.
