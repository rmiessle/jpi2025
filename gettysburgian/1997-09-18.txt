Housing always ranks high
among the concerns of Gettysburg
College students, but this year hous
ing has become an even more prized
commodity.
According to the Office of
Residence Life, (he current housing
situation is not a housing crisis, as all
the students have beds to sleep in.
However, all of the accom
modations traditionally offered on
campus have been filled. The Col
lege has had to make some other op
tions available.
Gettysburg is currently leas
ing the Criterion Motel on Carlisle
Street. It is housing twenty-one first
year students as well as one Residence
Assistant.

There are also twelve spaces
reserved at the Gettysburg Lutheran
Seminary. The Seminary housing is
set aside for upperclassmen. There
are currently eight rooms in use, in
cluding one by the Residence Assis
tant. All of the rooms at the semi
nary are singles with carpets and air
conditioning. Although these hous
ing options are quite appealing to
some students, the question remains,
what has brought on this sudden on
slaught of students?
There are numbers of factors
that have influenced the current hous
ing situation. The most obvious rea
son for the lack of traditional campus
housing is the large number of stu
dents. The current class of first
year students, the class of 2001, is
larger than any other class on cam
pus. The College only planned on ap
proximately 620 First-Year students

The annual Cupola Society Celebration will be held Saturday
see related story—p 3

coming to Gettysburg this fall. Six
hundred forty-four, however, are now
on campus.
According to the department
of Admissions, the First-Year students
are not the only influencing factor.
There was a higher retention of
upperclass students as well. The origi
nal number projected by the College
for returning students was too low.
While these factors are both
potentially positive situations for the
College, it does create some problems,
housing being one of them.
Yet another reason for the
surplus of students requiring housing
is influenced by the fraternities. Many
of the houses are not filled to their full
est capacity. The displacement of fra
ternities from campus also played a
major role in the current housing situ
ation. When their housing was lost,
the College suddenly had to find beds
for many of the brothers of Tau Kappa
Epsilon and Phi Delta Theta.
Two final influencing factors
are more students who had withdrawn

returning to Gettysburg, and a decreas
ing number of students living off-cam
pus. Tim Rupe, Director of Resi
dence Life, believes that this is "a good
problem; it means there are more
qualified people here." Rupe believes
that the increase in the number of stu
dents, both new and returning, has not
only increased in quantity but in qual
ity as well.
Delwin Gustafson, Dean of
Admissions, does not believe that this_,
housing situation will affect the accep
tance rates for upcoming years.
The current housing situation
is an ongoing process, interlinking
many departments on campus. It re
mains to be seen what will happen next
year. Will there be enough beds for
all the bodies?

Is death an appropriate form
of punishment for those who have
committed a murder? This ques
tion has long been a topic of great
debate.
In 1983 there were a total of
five executions performed in the
United States; by 1990 that num
ber rose to twenty-three and this
year, the number has increased to
fifty executions. Many believe the
death penalty should be abolished
altogether. Others believe that ex
ecutions are an appropriate and
necessary punishment for anyone
who commits a murder. Lisa
Bartle, assistant director of the
Death Penalty Information Center
will be addressing Gettysbuig Col
lege on these issues during the sec
ond Common Hour of the year, to
be held next Thursday, September

Brethren

Jennifer Brown of
Upperco, Maryland, has recently
undertaken a one year Church of
the Brethren Volunteer Service
(BVS) assignment with National
Coalition to Abolish the Death
Penalty in Washington, DC.
The National Coalition to
Abolish the Death Penalty
(NCADP) was founded in 1976,
the year the U.S. Supreme Court
opened the way for resumption of
executions in the United States.
NCADP works with more than
one hundred affiliated offices
throughout the U.S. and serves as
a resource and coordination cen
ter for the movement to abolish
the death penalty. Jennifer's re
sponsibilities include sending out
requested materials, organization
the educational materials in the
office, and editing newsletters.

Jenn is a 1996 graduate of
Gettysburg College with degrees

in Political Science and Classics.
She was a member of Eta Sigma Phi
(National Classics Honor Society).
She has been involved in a number
of activities: Among others she vol
unteered at Hanover Hospital, was
part of Vision quest Youth Group
and worked with children in the
Sunday school of her church. She
enjoys drawing, playing the piano,
reading, arts and crafts, cooking and
baking. Jenn is member of Mt. Zion
United Methodist Church in
Upperco, Maryland.
Jenn's new assignment to
National Coalition to Abolish the
Death Penalty followed an orienta
tion in New Windsor, MD where a
group of 15 volunteers came to
gether from all over the U.S. and
Germany. For three weeks they
lived together as a community and
studied such topics as the death pen
alty, conflict resolution, welcoming
diversity and cross-cultural aware
ness. They also spent days work

Alum works to end death penalty

25. Lisa Bartle works with The
Death Penalty Information Center
to provide information and critical
analysis on issues concerning the
death penalty to the media and the
general public. The Death Penalty
Information Center does take a spe
cific stand on capital punishment:
they believe it is wrong. However,
Bartle will present both the pro and
con sides of the argument in her
discussion on Thursday.
Bartle will also focus her talk
on four prominent issues concern
ing the death penalty and society
today. These issues include racial
disparity, the execution of the men
tally retarded, the costs of the death
penalty, and the restrictions on ap
peals of persons given the death
penalty.

The issue of race has been a
major factor in determining the use
of the death penalty in murder

cases. Surprisingly, the biggest
predictor of whether or not the
murderer is sentenced to death
does not have to do with the race
of the murderer. The biggest pre
dictor is the race of the victim.
The Death Penalty Information
Center has found that those who
murdered whites were more likely
to be sentenced to death than those
who murdered blacks. This fact
reveals a whole new aspect under
the controversy of the death pen
alty, that of racism.
The mentally disabled are

another group of people who have
been singled out when discussing
the issues of the death penalty.
Many believe that executions of
the mentally retarded should not
be permitted because these indi
viduals are not always capable of
making morally correct decisions,
and therefore they should not be
as severely punished for their ac
tions. However, others believe
that the mentally retarded should
be responsible if they take some
one else's life and that they are
capable of knowing the difference
between right and wrong.

The issue on the restrictions
of appeals is also a great concern
for many in today's society. Re
cently the court system has been
discussing implementing restric
tions on how many appeals an in
mate on death row may have.
Many believe that such re
strictions will lead to the execu
tion of innocent people. If the
number of appeals are cut, it is
possible that new evidence could
arise on the murderer's favor that
would not be allowed to be heard
in court. The Death Penalty In
formation Center has stated in
their web site that since 1970, 71
people have been released from
death row with evidence of their

innocence. If in 1970 appeals had
been restricted to these death row
inmates, they probably would have
been killed.
The financing of an execu
tion is also a topic of great debate
today. The cost of the execution
of a prisoner is very expensive. For
example, Florida spent an esti
mated $57 million on the death
penalty from 1973-1988 to per
form eighteen executions, which is
an average of $3.2 million dollars
per execution.
Following Bartle's lecture
on the death penalty there will be
a fifteen minute discussion session
where students will be able to ask
questions and voice their opinions.
There will also be a complimen
tary lunch served after the lecture
which will allow students to con-

hie photo

tinue talking about this much
heated debate. Dean Nordvall is
hoping to have local attorneys at
tend the lunch to interact with the
students and to discuss any ques
tions or concerns they may have.
The issue of the death pen
alty is one of great controversy and
debate. Whether or not the court
system should be given the right
to kill someone raises many ques
tions about morality and ethics.
Unfortunately the majority of these
questions can only be answered
with various conflicting responses.
There is currently a group on
campus dedicated to the opposition
of capital punishment - The
Gettysburg Coalition To Abolish
the Death Penalty. Any students
interested in the group can contact
Dean of First-Year Students Bob
Nordvall.

Next Thursday s forum will
provide members of the College
community with an opportunity to
arrive at an informed decision re
garding this controversial topic.

College receives $250,000 challenge

Gettysburg College Press Release
Tom and Joan Norris, York
residents and 1960 graduates of
Gettysburg College, have an
nounced a challenge gift to their
alma matter of up to $250,000.
The amount of the final gift will
depend on fellow alumni match
ing their donation through new or
increased gifts to the College's
Annual Fund.
"The Norris Alumni Chal
lenge" will be in effect during the
College's current fund year, which
began on July 1 and ends on June
30, 1998. The Norris gift will
match dollar for dollar up to
$200,000 all new or increased gifts
by donors who qualify for mem
bership in the College's Cupola
society or Cupola Society Associ
ates.

The Norrises will also con
tribute $50,000 to the College if 40
percent of Gettysburg alumni
make a gift to the College's An
nual Fund by the end of the fund

year. During the most recent fund
year, 36 percent of Gettysburg
alumni made such a gift.
"Colleges such as
Gettysburg rely heavily on annual
gifts from alumni and friends to
help guarantee educational oppor
tunities for present and future stu
dents," the Norrises said. "We
hope our challenge will encourage
annual contributors to give a little
more and non-contributors to start
what will hopefully become an
annual tradition."
Tom Norris is the chairman,
president, and chief executive of
ficer of PH Glatfelter, Co., Spring
Grove, and a former Gettysburg
College trustee. Joan is a home
maker and daughter of R.M.
Wachob, a member of the Class of
1927. Tom and Joan are the par
ents of Cathy, a member of the
Class of 1990. In addition to their
past Gettysburg activities, both
continue in active volunteer work

for the College.
The Norris Challenge will

be announced on Saturday, Sep
tember 20, at the annual Cupola
Society Celebration held on cam
pus. Cupola Society membership
is granted to alumni who contrib
ute $ 1250 or more to the College's
Annual Fund. The recently estab
lished Cupola Associates program
grants Cupola membership to
younger alumni who have contrib
uted $ 100 for each year since their
graduation.
"The Norrises have always
set the example for service to
Gettysburg College in their many
gifts of time, talent, and financial
resources," said Gordon A.
Haaland, president of Gettysburg.
"The Norris Alumni Challenge
will serve as a wonderful catalyst
to boost our alumni participation
and increase the number of lead
ership donors to the Annual Fund."
The Norris gift will be used
by the College for a capital im
provement to be determined after
completion of the current fund
year.

Pell issue creates rift between four
year and community colleges

CPS Community college leaders
say they'll block any efforts by
four-year institutions to make Pell
grants tuition sensitive.
Associations represent
ing four-year public and private
colleges and universities have pro
posed tying Pell Grants more
closely to the cost of college. That
would make a student who attends
a costlier eligible to receive a larger
grant than if he or she enrolled in
less pricey institution.
However, American As
sociation of Community Colleges
members say "tuition sensitive"
Pell Grants would make it harder
for their neediest students to attend
college at all. They also fear it may
cause community college students
to migrate to four-year, public uni
versities.

"I don't think that our
students should be treated any dif
ferently, depending on where they
want to go," said Simon Visser,
associate controller for the City
Colleges of Chicago.
Visser says tuition-sensi
tive Pell Grants are unfair because
students attending lower-priced
institutions would not qualify for
the maximum grant.
On the other hand, the

As Congress moves to au
thorize legislation that would ex
tend the Higher Education Act,
which is due to expire this fall, the
debate over Pell Grants reflects a
wider policy question about stu
dent aid: Should the government
focus student aid on the neediest
students, or distribute it so all stu
dents can go to the college of their
choice?
Next year, the maximum
Pell Grant will be $2,700, "which
will go a long way in paying the
cost at a four-year school," said
Hnllhrnok.

American Association of State
Colleges and Universities is
strongly in favor of such a system,
saying it will allow some students
to attend member schools without
having to take out loans.
Ray Hallbrook, director
of financial aid at Tennessee Tech
nological University, supports tu
ition-sensitive grants. "The Pell
Grant isn't addressing the needs
that we have as a nation with re
gard to higher educational costs,"
Hollbrook said.
Hollbrook says most stu
dents pay a four-year, public uni
versity education with a Pell Grant,
income from part-time work and
loans. However, if Pell Grants
were tuition sensitive, students
could expect to receive enough
grant money to avoid the necessity
of a loan, he adds.

Students learning to use the Internet for papers, _pvcrastination

by Melodie Foster and Sam

Staff W riter/Contributing _Writet
Ahhhh, the Internet. Ev
eryone is doing it. In today's so
ciety, it is almost impossible to
go through a week and not come
in contact with some form of net
surfing or web browsing, and
practically every commercial on
TV ends with a web site at the
bottom of the screen. Here at
Gettysburg, as at most colleges
and universities, students have
fast, inexpensive (well, if you
don't count tuition) access to the
Internet and all it has to offer.
Well, what does the
In tenet have to offer? What
doesn't it have to offer? Students
can, with merely the touch of a
finger, access a huge body of in
formation and services.

Many students use the web
as an in-room library on which
they can do research for papers.
The New York Times and maga
zines such as Time can be ac
cessed online, as can a few peri
odicals not found in the library.
Sophomore Carrie
Mercadante had to research a
myth for her Latin class, so she
turned to the Internet: "I looked
it up, I found everything I

needed, and I didn't have to go to
the library."
The Internet can be used to do
certain types of research, but for

Some Spanish classes now
have students perform verb i
exercises online, and several
of the first year seminars re- i
quire students to set up web
pages. While the value of the
Internet as a research tool can- i
not be underestimated, many
students simply use it for en- i
tertainment purposes.
"I sometimes use it for
research, but not really,"
sophomore history major i
Amy Lucadamo said. U
Students can access web
sites of their favorite actors, au
thors, movies, Broadway shows,

While the value of
the Internet as a

many student use
the Internet for

The Internet also has many
practical applications. News and
weather can be accessed twenty
four hours a day. It can be used to
find cheap airfares, and even to
purchase tickets and make _res>er
vations.
TV Guide can be subscribed
to online, and many towns have

home pages that include the local
newspaper.
Another aspect of the
Internet is that of "chatting"—
" speaking" with others across the
country, even across the world,
about random topics.
According Brent Martyn,
1 who heads the WZBT radio sta
tion web page, the web can be
summarized in a single word —
advertising.
"I've been hired to do web
pages; I use them to advertise.

Exploring the web for ei

with the rapid advancement of
internet browsers. Martyn, a jun
ior computer science major, pre
fers Communicator 4.03.
He has also experimented
with the new Internet Explorer 4.0

are only some of the changes ex

and moie Martyn also foresees more
interactive programming to for the
Net, as well as programs such as
Cyber Patrol and Net Nanny to pro
tect younger users from porno
graphic web sites.
"I think there will be a lot
more self-censoring devices,"
Martyn said.
As for search engines,
Lucadamo, along with many other
web users, prefers "Yahoo!" be
cause it is the most user-friendly
and comes up with the largest num
ber of useful sites.
Martyn also recommends
"Savvy," which is similar to "Ya
hoo!" but possesses broader
searching capabilities.
"It incorporates all the
search engines. So if you're really
searching for something, use
'Savvy,'" Martyn said.

Though the Internet is not
the best tool for research, it is a
spectacular resource for almost
anything else. It is simple to use,
even by the most inexperienced
person, and can open up a whole
new world of random facts, intro
duce you to people who share even
the craziest of interests, and adds
a whole new dimension to procras

The new class: 2001 largest class ever to hit the 'Burg

byKnstenHeider Contributing Writer
We are well into the month
of September, yet many of the
first year students still remember
their first days at Gettysburg
College. Six hundred and forty
six new students arrived on Au
gust 24, making the class of 2001
the largest class to enter
Gettysburg in the history of the
college.
Where did all these fresh
men come from? The class of
2001 comes from thirty states
and eleven foreign countries.
There are students from as-far
west as California, and many
others are from Gettysburg's
home state of Pennsylvania. On
my floor alone, there are girls
from stales such as New Jersey,

New York, Connecticut, Pennsylva
nia, and Tennessee, to give a fairly
typical representation.
Why did these students decide
to leave their hometowns and come
to Gettysburg? There are any num
ber of reasons why people selected
Gettysburg over other colleges to
which they applied. Most of these
reasons deal with the academics and
the many opportunities offered at
Gettysburg.
Yet for many, financial aid
played a large part in why they chose
Gettysburg College. In fact, when I
spoke with a number of freshmen,
financial aid was the first reason to
pop out of their mouths. This shows
that students not only have to find
schools that rank high in academics,
athletics, and opportunities, but also
one that fits in their budgets.

Another factor they consid
ered was the friendliness of the
people here. That's something I
remember from Get Acquainted
Day. I couldn't walk five feet with
out a student or faculty member
saying hello or just smiling at me.
It really made me feel like part of
the college.
For the class of 2001, 3777
students applied to Gettysburg, and
2706 were accepted. Out of those
2706 that were accepted, 646
chose to enroll.
The ratio of men to women
in the latest freshmen class is al
most equal. 52% of the class are
women, with the other 48% being
male. This may be interesting, but
not necessarily a reason to attend
Gettysburg (particularly if you're
female).

These numbers are fairly
similar to those for the class of
2000. That year had 3884 students
apply, with 2547 being accepted.
632 students enrolled, with a ratio
of 55% female to 45% male.
It isn't just the college that
offers many different opportuni
ties, but the students as well. As I
have said, we have freshmen from
thirty states and eleven foreign
countries. This gives Gettysburg
a very diverse population which
makes everyone's experience all
the more interesting and exciting,
It is important for Gettysburg to
have diversity because even
though this is a small town and a
small community, we need to see
the big picture. The students at
Gettysburg can see a small piece
of the world when the campus is

diverse.
To ensure this diversity, Ad
missions targets high school vis
its, makes special telephone calls,
and communicates specifically
with students of color that are in
terested in Gettysburg. Admis
sions believes it is important to also
give the current students that add
diversity to the college a good ex
perience. Every individual at
Gettysburg makes the college a
more diverse setting.
The class of 2001 is only the
latest addition to the Gettysburg
community. Through its four years
here, many things will change.
And diverse as they may be, the
students who graduate in 2001 will
always have Gettysburg College to
tie them together.

II is hard lo express in writ
ing what I have witnessed in the
twelve days since we arrived in
London. We were so excited to be
a part of another culture, one
thought to be so close to ours.
Little did we know this trip would
be so much more than we could
have expected. I will never forget
what I have seen or experienced in
these last few days.
Nothing prepared us for liv
ing in a mourning nation. The
world we were just beginning to
know changed overnight - literally.
The news was so shocking, we

could barely believe it. There was
a feeling that this moment in his
tory, this tragedy, was something
we could feel and experience, but
not completely understand.
Many of us made our own
"pilgrimages" to the palaces of
Kensington and Buckingham that
same day. I do not know what it
was that made us go. I was not
totally prepared for such intense
feelings, the immediate outpouring
of grief. The scene, though cap
tured by many photos, comes short
of the feeling of standing at the
gates of those palaces and seeing
the sorrow, tears and flowers of so
many who probably never met the
woman. It was odd to know that I
was so much at the center of such
an event.

I remember someone in
the group made a remark that 1
agreed with: "This, must be
what the United States was like
at the death of JFK."
A nation mourning is
something to experience; one
could see a visible change in the
way many people acted, as if
human mortality was realized
and pondered by a whole nation;
as if for perhaps a few moments
they saw that even a princess can
meet with an untimely death,
anytime, before we have a
chance to live life to its fullest

extent. Many of our group can
recall a day many years ago,
watching a young and impres
sionable woman walk down the
aisle in St. Paul's Cathedral to
become a princess. Through the
years, we've followed her life
through all its joys and sorrows.
On Saturday we sat to
gether in a different country,
surrounded by our new friends,
separated from loved ones, to
watch that same princess talk
her last "walk" down another
aisle in Westminster Abbey.
Once she had walked; this day,
she was carried while those who
loved her and work with her
looked on with tears and looks
of disbelief.
We, though citizens of
another country, felt the love for
such an inspirational figure and

abioad sham views
realized the impact of her shoil
presence with us.
Yes, we have lost a won-
derful person through a horrible
tragedy, but I feel that it had
made people rcalue that what
you do in life matters and affects
many people, as well as the face
that life, even for those we con-
sider to be above death, is a frag
ile thing that should not be taken
for granted.
JillMacArthur-
I did not follow the events
of her life as many others have,
so although it was a shock to find
out Diana was killed in a car
wreck, it did not affect me.
How can I feel sorrow for
someone I never knew person
ally? Naturally I feel bad for her
friends and family.

Although I may sound
cynical, I often wondered if
people only waited in lines for
hours to sign the condolence
book just to have their name there
rather than because they truly felt
sympathy. It seems that many
people only wanted to go to the
funeral procession to say they
had been there rather than to pay
respects.
I am sure there were a mix
ture of native mourners and tour
ists who sincerely cared as well,
but I did not go because I had no
reason to be there.
Living in London at this
time did not alter my perception

on'
\
mc (
anc sor
m tragedy from a diffe
of events, but I fell close to the heart
of what was occurring. I only wish
now CNN and the local papers would
let this go.
Erin Quay -
What I have experienced and
witnessed in the past week has proved
incomparable to any previous event.
Due to the death of the Princess
of Wales, thousands of teary-eyed
men, women, and children lined the
streets of London. The funeral pro
voked tears from a whole country, as
they all felt touched by the unique
Princess.
The day of the funeral, the
streets were void of people and cars,
and the only sound was that of many
televisions playing the funeral in uni
snn.

Being here for this tragic event
has left me feeling very distant from
these people. I was shocked and sad
dened upon hearing about the devas
tating death, but these people have felt
the hurt the deepest.
I do not believe that we have
anyone in the United States who
would have this strong effect on so
many people.
The image of Prince William
and Prince Harry walking behind their
mother's casket is one that I will never
forget. I have never seen a whole coun
try mourn like this, and this has proved
to be a very chilling experience.
Kristen Blanco -
I find it difficult to put into

rent point of view
words my feelings about the death
of Princess Diana, mainly because
I'm not exactly sure of these feel
ings. To me, her death still does not
seem real. When I saw the head
lines Sunday morning, I kept think
ing that it was all a joke - a tabloid's
plot to attract the reader's eye and
make money.
However, even after watch
ing the funeral, I still have not fully
accepted the fact that she is dead.
This is not to say, however, that her
death has not affected me. Rather,
it is a loss that has affected me a
great deal, a feeling of loss intensi
fied by the fact that I am living in
London.

As tragic as the loss of Diana
is, I feel almost fortunate that I am
so close to such a historical event,
yet at the same time, I feel almost
intrusive.
It is amazing to see how
deeply the British mourn the loss
of their Princess, and, as an Ameri
can, I feel as if I have no place in
this grieving.
This is the first in a series of
articles written by the students
spending this semester in London
and Essex, England.

Roberts drops
the bouquet

byJonFr oehlich
Staff Writer "You have a small but dis
tinct window of opportunity to do
the right thing." - George
"My Best Friend's Wed
ding," starring Julia
Roberts("Prelty Woman," "Con
spiracy Theory") as Julianne Pot
ter, is the story of a woman whose
life and self-image are shattered
when she discovers that her per
fect man and best friend since col
lege is marrying his perfect woman
- and it's not her.
With the only thing that
Julianne could always depend on
having fallen through, she takes it
as her mission to break up her best
friend's weddi. g and take the
groom for herself.
While it is unclear exactly
how we are expected to react to
Julianne's character, audiences
will most likely find her to be de
vious and selfish. While viewers

may enjoy seeing how low she can
go, the scheming Julianne quickly
loses her charm, leaving audiences
hoping that she'll finally do the
right thing.
Though viewers might not
enjoy Julianne as a character, the
movie tends to compensate for this
probable reaction by having all her
little plans backfire. It is in this
that we see the comedy and enter
tainment that "My Best Friend's
Wedding" has to offer.

Most everything that
Julianne does to bring out the
worst in the bride of "her" man
actually ends up emphasizing her
perfection and infuriates Julianne,
to the delight of viewers.
Though Roberts is the star
of "My Best Friend's Wedding,"
much of the plot is worked out very
well through the characters of
George, Kimmy and Mike. With
a terrific amount of acting talent,
these three characters support the
plot well and prove to be much
more likeable than Julianne.

George, played by Rupert
Everett ("The Madness of King
George"), is Julianne's good friend
and editor who is unwittingly
pulled into her scheme to break up
the happy couple.
Though he eventually be
comes just as sick of the whole
thing as audiences will tend to, he
initially finds his role to be an in
teresting and fun challenge, when
Julianne tells everyone that he is
her fiance. In what is perhaps the
best scene in the movie, George
tells how he and Julianne met in a
mental institution.

Cameron Diaz ("Feeling
Minnesota," "She's the One") is
Kimmy Wallace - the bubbly,
twenty year old that is set to marry
the man of both her's and Julianne's
dreams. Her near perfection and
comments on spring break annoy
Julianne to no end, but will most
likely charm audiences.
The other half of the perfect
couple is Mike O'Neal, played by
Dermot Mulroney ("Young Guns,"
"Bad Girls"). He suspects Julianne
of nothing and accepts her pres
ence as a gesture from a true friend
as any normal person would. He
only discovers Julianne's true mo
tives when she guiltily admits it to
them following her success. The
light comedy and emotion of "My
Best Friend's Wedding" come
when Julianne, with the words "be
careful what you wish for..." ring
ing in her head, is forced to undo
her damage and finally come
clean, to the relief of audiences.

This sparse drama, added
to a few very entertaining scenes,
make "My Best Friend's Wed
ding," while not very memorable,
possibly worth your money.

Prelude leads to true love

In Case You Missed I

by Glen Beck
Staff Writer
What if the person you loved
was not the person you married?
That is the premise of the 1992
film, Pwlude to a Kiss, based on
the play written by Craig Lucas.
Directed by Norman Rene, the film
is a contemporary fairy tale with a
not-so contemporary plot twist.
Alec Baldwin reprises the
role of Peter Hoskins, a part that
he played in the original off
Broadway production. The movie
also stars Meg Ryan (Rita Boyle),
Kathy Bates (Leah Blier), Ned
Beatty (Dr. Boyle), Patty Duke
(Mrs. Boyle), and Syndney Walker
(Old Man).
The story unfolds as
Baldwin and Ryan meet at a party
and dance gawkily into each
other's hearts. He's boring and
geeky. She's totally energetic. The
cliche of opposites attracting cer
tainly applies to their situation.

They instantaneously estab
lish a relationship filled with per
sonal secrets and cute phrases.
Soon alter, Peter proposes and Rita
accepts. Right before the wedding,
Rita slips into Peter's dressing
room and the couple engage in
conversation.
Peter tells Rita that he loves
her, and Rita questions, "What
about when I'm a hundred years
old with a mustache and yellow
teeth." He assures her that he will
still love her. "And when I'm sag
ging down lo here and I'm bald?"
"I'll love you all the more,"
he replies certainly.
In any fairy tale, something
must happen, and it does here, too.
Right on the mythic cue, at the
wedding, mysterious well-wisher
Walker gives Ryan a kiss. Sud
denly, Ryan is not quite herself,
and Baldwin must find out what's
wrong and save her. The movie
then shifts into high fairy tale gear,

bringing an intriguing dimension
to the story.
The acting is very well done.
Baldwin handles the shift in his
character well. Ryan is her usual
cute and charming self (well, be
fore her change, that is).
Duke and Beatty are hysteri
cal as the Boyles. They are awk
ward, naive and insane, which
makes you love them even more.
But I'd have to say that
Walker deserves the most credit for
the movie. He is extremely believ
able in his portrayal of the dual
sided character. Near the end of
the movie, he delivers one of the
most moving monologues I've
ever heard (which would make a
good audition piece for all you
Theater majors out there).
So if you are looking for a
good date movie, I'd suggest rent
ing this one. But make sure you're
in a sappy mood with a profound
state of mind before you watch it.

Ross's Reads more than a restroom

byKabir Kumar
Staff Writer "Our washroom is available
to whomsoever wants to use it,'
says Ross Hetrick, owner of Ross's
Reads, a used-book store on
Middle Street in Gettysburg thai
also serves gourmet coffee and of
fers a wide range of magazines and
newspapers to its patrons.
"I hate signs that say 'Wash
rooms are for Patrons Only'," he
adds. His cafe/bookstore does not
restrict any outsider from using the
washroom. In fact, people are free
to walk into Ross's Reads, browse,
lounge in the upholstered chairs
and couches and, walk out with
out spending a dime.
However, Hetrick advises
otherwise. "I have the best froth
anywhere," he says, describing his
cappuccino, which he has per
fected over the last fifteen years.
"People are truly impressed by my
froth." However, whipping up
frothy cappuccinos and welcom-

Pholoby MarkAstrom
ing people into his store is not what
Hetrick has always done. He used
to be a financial reporter for the
Baltimore Sun before he moved to
Gettysburg.
Hetrick worked on the staff
of the Baltimore Evening Sun for
14 years and then worked another
four years from 1991 to 1995 with
the Baltimore Sun. "They were
downsizing and I took a buy out,"
he says.
But there were other reasons
that also played a role in his
family's decision to leave Balti
more. For his work on various
community organizations, Hetrick
and his family were harassed on
numerous occasions. One evening
they confronted a teenager who
threatened to tear down their
Christmas lights.
"We had enough," says
Hetrick.
He and his wife had vaca
tioned in Lancaster and Gettysburg
and had liked them. They decided
to move to either one place or the
other. But when it came down to

the final choice, something
other than a small town ap
peal played an important
role. Thaddcus Stevens,
popularly known as "The
Scourge of the South," be
gan his career as a lawyer
and politician in Gettysburg.
"He is, according to me, the
most famous unkown per
son in history," says Hetrick.
Stevens was the leader
of the Radical Republicans
during Reconstruction, and
right up to his death fought
to prove that all men are
equal. Hetrick has a framed
copy of Stevens' epitaph
hanging in Ross's Reads that
says he was buried in a
"mixed" cemetary.
Hetrick, somewhat of
a history buff, greatly ad
mired Thaddeus Stevens and
decided that he would start
his new career in
Gettysburg.

He and his wife
bought a bed and breakfast
called Country Escape, six
miles west of Gettysbuig
and later, in March of last
year, opened Ross's Reads
in a Civil War building on
Middle Street.
"The coffee cups that
we are using today I bought
two years ago," says
Hetrick, adding that owning
a place like Ross's Reads is
what he always wanted to
do. "I definitely don't miss
the day to day reporting." he
adds. He says that there is a
fundamental difference be
tween reporting and owning
a small business. As a reporter,
he probed into other people's
affairs, but as a small business
owner he enjoys the fact that
people come to his shop for a

conversation.
Hetrick also carries a
'laid back entrepreneurial' per
sonality which he picked up
from an individual named
Sandy MacAdams he knew
while he was at college.
MacAdams owned a large
bookstore as well as a little
French restaurant. "That is the
type of person I would like to
be," says Hetrick.
"What I want to prove is
that business can be fun - it can

Ross's Reads offers many varieties of coffee to their patrons
along with the house specialty: frothy cappucinos

be creative and a benefit to the
community," says Hetrick. "And,
of course, profitable."
It is for this reason Hetrick
plans to extend his hours on Fri
days and Saturdays to 11 pm. He
has scheduled folk music perfor
mances and poetry readings on a
number of Fridays in September.
He has also helped organize the

Photo bv Mark Astrom

Gettysburg Book Festival at his
bookstore on the 27th of Septem
ber. Hetrick hopes that his phi
losophy of "if you have a good
product people will come" will
prove itself as more and more
people, especially Gettysburg Col
lege students, visit his store and
cafe - even if it is only to use the
facilities.

Dear Casey...

Dear Casey,
I have a pr oblem. lama
sophom' / e and am ver y in
volved with various activities
here on campus. I did not r eal
izethatmyworkloadwouldhave _increasedsodrastkallyfr omlast
year andfoundthatlam having
trouble balancing ever y thing in
myliferightnow . Anyadvice?
Thanks,
Overloaded Dear Overload,
Seems like you have a prob
lem that many college students
tend to have. The key to the prob
lem is balance. It is extremely dif
ficult, and sometimes emotionally
distressful, to cut down on activi
ties and positions that you really
enjoy doing.
The reason you are in col
lege, though, is to benefit from a
quality education. By no means
should you sacrifice your aca
dem'c learning, --our sanity, and
your health to be involved in ac
tivities. _i .
i _i

detrimental to your health and your
lifestyle. After all, they are what
they arc called, extra.
Dear Casey ,
I work with this guy in
whomlamsor t of inter ested. I
think he knows that I like him,
but I am having tr ouble r eading
him. Lately he ha" been wink
ing and smiling at me in the of
fice, and I do not know how to
interpr et his actions. Please
help. Thanks, Confused
Dear Confused,
Did you ever tell him your
feelings for him? If not, then he
might be testing the waters by get
ting your reaction to his flirtatious
maneuvers. You probably know by
now how the rumor mill works,
and if he has heard a rumor, he
might be trying to justify it, in a
rather roundabout way.

It is also possible that he
might think he knows the truth and
is trying to be funny or friendly, or
just plain stupid. Some people fail
to realize that others might be con
fused or even hurt by their actions.
Actions do speak louder
than words sometimes. Next time
he pulls a flirtatious stunt, pull one
back, but be creative. Let him
know that two can play at this
game of love.
This guy sounds like he
could either be a rambunctious
fellow with an innate flirtatious
quality, or a pompous and obnox
ious individual who does not de
serve your time or attention. Yout
opinion is your own, just be care
ful. Good luck.

What it _sounds like you need
to do is sit down and do a little soul
searching. Make a list of all that
you do and review it carefully.
What are the things that you can
cut out, or cut down on? Think
about what is central, and what
isn't. A mistake that many college
students make is spreading them
selves too thin. This only means
that you would be hurting not only
all the organizations you are com
mitted to, but also your personal
well being.
Bottom line: extracurricular
activities are meant to be fun, not

~ a little cash for good ideas ~
During the '97 - '98 academic year the Office of student Activities & College Union is happy
to support approximately nine student ideas each semester that bring a small group of stu
dents and the campus community together in The Junction, Patio, or Cafe 101 in the Bullet
Hole for a special program We have established a fund (up to $100.00 a program) to offer
students who are interested in turning their idea into their own program. The
program may be targeted to an audience or group as small at 5 or as large at 100.
It is our intent to support ideas that would otherwise not necessarily come to fruition
without a little funding and to support ideas that are not affiliated with an already funded
group. We are certain that students have an abundance of great ideas! We are glad to meet
with you to dicsuss the merits of your idea and how you might be able to make lagniappe
magic. We may not be able to fund all ideas, but we will try.
Please come see us in CUB 250 or call X6307 and just say "Lagniappe!"

Letters to the Editor
Put down the pen, propose solutions, prepare for action

Mr. Isherwood,
I commend and applaud
your efforts in an attempt to curve
sexual abuse and alcohol abuse on
this campus. I feel your efforts and
words are something that in an
ideal world, or as you refer to it, a
civilized society, would be greeted
with praise for their honesty and
direction. However, while your
article is quite eloquent, I am not
sure it proposes any realistic
course of action, or really any
course of action at all.
Perhaps I am confused. Are
you claiming that these "Red
Zone" signs are unnecessary? Are
you saying that they are necessary?

Or are you appalled that we need
them at all? Perhaps it is a little of
any of these, but would you prefer
that our college community go
uninformed? The Women's Cen
ter in partnership with the college
has taken a huge step in the edu
cation of our community when it
comes to the issue of sexual abuse.
Their efforts should be supported
by every person on this campus—
from the President of the college
to the most rambunctious student.
If these Red Zone signs save even
one person from a situation where
they could be injured or raped, isn't
that fact alone enough to continue
on with this course of action? I

have known too many women who
have been the victims of this crime.
If these signs that you seem to feel
are so tasteless and appalling are
at the same time effective, then
why should the college stop using
them? I agree, the Red Zone signs
are quite frightening, but that is the
point. Perhaps I am misunder
standing here, but you seem to
claim that you don't understand
how rape and drunken hook-ups
with "Red-Zone predators" can
exist in a civilized society. Sir,
who ever claimed that college is a
civilized society? We, at a school
like _Gettj sburg, have a small com
munity where we can get to know
many of the people on campus,
attend classes regularly, and have
a good time. Perhaps this sounds
civilized, but I say this is as far
from "civilization" as we can pos
sibly get. You see under each of
the aforementioned ideals, there is
a Mr. Hyde lurking.

We may get to know many
people on campus. We might be a
member of a Greek organization,
or we might not. We might be on
Student Senate, or part of the
Women's center, or have a pro
gram on WZBT, where our voices
can be heard by any who care to
listen. But all these connections
mean nothing when one of those
people who we believe are so close
to us, hurts us in an unimaginable
way. Remember, there are very
few cases of someone jumping out
of the bushes and dragging a
woman into some deserted alley.
These "Red Zone Predators" are
usually the ones you seeeveryday
in classes or in clubs.
As for the idea that we each
come to college to have fun, in
some way, shape, or form, could
this statement not be more true?

When I think back on my last three
years here, I remember the times
when I was with my brothers, or
went on a date, or played my gui
tar. It's not just about classes. In
the words of Mark Twain, "I never
let schooling interfere with my
education." But fun is a relative
term. What is fun for you may not
be fun for your friend, or parents,
or teachers. Our good times are
curbed by the limitations put upon
us by those we surround ourselves
with. We do not have a license to
do as we please.
So what can you, or anyone
else in the college community do?

For God's sakeTHINK!!!! Before
going to that party, don't drink,
especially hard alcohol. I have
done this, I have had those random
hook-up nights; in fact I've had too
many of them. I am still trying to
live down a reputation that was
established in my first semester of
college. Some of my friends, those
people who I am close to, still con
sider me this person who treated
women so poorly his freshmen
year. The person who is writing
this response is no longer the na
ive freshman, but a determined,
feeling, caring member of this
community, but it came at the cost
of his honor.

Mr.Isherwood, you write
that your heart sunk when you saw
these naive freshmen and yet all
you do to help them is write an
article in the paper condemning the
hard work of the college and the

efforts of the Women's Center. Do
you believe that your article will
put a halt to something that could
prevent dangerous situations? In
stead of defaming these people,
work with them. Volunteer! If you
disagree with policy, change it,
don't bash it. It won't do anything.
I am a firm believer in the saying
that actions speak louder than
words. Perhaps when I was a
freshman, a few words from a con
cerned friend might have helped
me dispel the myths about my
character. So all I can do is offer a
few words advice.
Gentlemen, and I am speak
ing to each of the men on this cam
pus, understand that no does mean
no. I empathize that it is very dif¬

ficult to control hormones, espe
cially when intoxicated. However,
is it worth hurting a friend and
possibly going to jail? Remember
sex can be a wonderful release, and
an incredibly pleasurable experi
ence. But if she is resisting you,
or she is too drunk to fully partici
pate, you are lowering yourself to
the animalistic standards. Some
men may enjoy being animals, but
we are supposedly on the forefront
of higher education. Can we at
least try to show it? If you are with
female friends at a party, keep an
eye on them. If you see one of
them hooking up with someone,
make sure they leave with you. In
a drunken stupor they may be an
gry with you,

but I bet they thank you the
next morning. Also, be careful,
those actions that are not always
noble have the potential of getting
you in trouble.
Women, there are many
ways you can remedy this prob
lem. One, never go anywhere
alone, especially if you have been
drinking. 99% of the time, the
male is going to be stronger so
unless you really trust the guy you
are with, don't put yourself m any
situation where you can be over
whelmed. Basically, please use
your minds. Don't let hormones,
or someone's golden tongue charm
you into doing something you
aren't willing to do.
As a final note, this is a prob
lem that must be attacked from a
variety of angles. Women, talk to
men, communication is ultimately
the key to solving this problem.

Men, be receptive, but also don't
be afraid to ask questions. You
won't lose any face by asking a
question you feel is silly. Besides
its better to understand now, than
to be in the dark sitting in prison.
You see folks, communica
tion and education are the keys to
solving this problem. As a male I
cannot even begin to imagine the
horror of rape. To anyone who
reads this article please realize
what it means to be raped. You are
not simply engaging in the act of
sex, you are forcibly and
animalistically asserting your will
on another. To any of you possible
rapists, imagine someone else of
your mindset hurting someone you
care about. How many sisters, or
girlfriends, or friends, have had
their lives permanently changed by
this heinous act? Please, I know
this article rambles on, but for once

in your lives think of how the
other person is feeling. If there
are any doubts, stop.
Mr. Isherwood, your article
proposes no solutions, nor is it a
progressive model for change at
our institution. Being old fash
ioned is fine, so long as it doesn't
interfere with the noble work of
those striving to end this problem.
Remember your morality is not
that of the person next to you.
Help them to see your world view.
If you care so much then act. I,
as well as others respect your
opinions and words, but I don't
find much use for them.
Respectively submitted,
With hopes for a better to
morrow,

Beyond symbolism
into substance

I appreciated that there is
someone out there who also sees
an avoided issue. I remember the
programs we required to attend
during the first semester at
Gettysburg. We were bombarded
with sexual assault programs. At
best groups like CHEERS gave
some women a good scare for a
day or two before everything went
back to normal. At worst was a
guest speaker who insulted the
men, polarized the audience, and
accomplished little in education.
The article by Mr.
Isherwood addresses a topic we
ignore beyond the first week or two
of our freshman year. But he stops
short. We have a surplus of edu
cation on this campus and it has
done nothing to change the situa
tion. Not one red poster on the
walls has prevented a woman from
being victimized.
I am not saying that we
should end the education or post
ers. I am saying they are only a
part of the solution. But in order
to change a negative situation we
must be willing to go beyond sym¬

bolism and enter substance. If you
are not following me, let me give
an example. During AIDS aware
ness week we all put a little red
ribbon on our coats and feel good
about helping out. In reality a red
piece of fabric doesn't prevent a
single person from contracting
AIDS, fund a single researcher, or
even comfort the dying. Only an
action of substance can do these
things. In the situation of rape
there are very few actions of sub
stance we can do. One is remov
ing alcohol from the mix. I am not
a prohibitionist. But we must rec
ognize that the laws of this state
must be obeyed. If you are under
21, don't drink. The college can
help enforce this if they will drop
the slap on the wrist punishments.
This would be substance.
Since coming to this college
I have known of at least three rapes
all involving alcohol. This led me
to change many things in my own
life and outlook. I can only ask
the campus, "What are you pre
pared to do?"

Conflict and Consensus

Pachyderm's Pulpit:
Communications key to solving
campus problems

byJohnDunlap
Staff Writer After what seemed to be a
very quick summer, we are back
to Gettysburg, and while there are
a lot of new faces, Gettysburg re
mains the same. This is year num
ber two for me here at College;
year number one was very memo
rable. It did have its highs and
lows, many more highs than lows.
Not only did I have great profes
sors and fairly interesting classes,
I joined a great fraternity and
made friendships that I am sure
will last a lifetime. Beyond that I
had the time of my life. However,
as I am sure the freshman, sorry I

mean politically correct, first-year
class already knows, Gettysburg
has its problems, one big prob
lem that I would like to concen
trate on is Penn Hall. For those
who were not here last year, dur
ing the early part of the second
semester, our College's president,
Dr. Gordon Haaland, and the
school's leadership came under
enormous scrutiny on a wide
range of issues. Issues ranging
from the tenure process to getting
only one day off for Easter Break.
The issue that seemed to epito
mize the College's leadership, or
lack there, of were Dr. Haaland's
frequent and long lasting sabbati
cals.

The criticism of the Presi
dent and the College Administra
tion did bring about an interest
ing debate on the state of Gettys
burg College. When the President
came before the student body in a
Town Hall Meeting, he was bom
barded with questions on a wide
range of issues. One positive re
sult, found in last week's Gettys
burgian, is the President's more
frequent Town Hall Meetings.
One of our biggest problems is
that there seems to be a discon
nect between Penn Hall and the
rest of the campus. Dialogue can
do a lot, and if students feel Dr.
Haaland is on a particular prob
lem then that goes halfway to
solving the problem.
The President should try to
meet as many students as possible.

II he were to pay an occasional
visit to dorms and talk to the stu
dents then that could do wonders
for student-administration dia
logue. It is a shame that most stu
dents at Gettysburg can not even
recognize their President. Not
only should the President try to
reach out more, but he should use
the Provost, Dr. DiNicola, and
Dean Ramsey. President Haaland
cannot be everywhere, but he
should try to get out more. As a
student senator, I would love to be
able to welcome the President, the
Provost, and Dean Ramsey to more
our meetings; we are the elected
representatives of Gettysburg Col
lege. Another powerful commu
nication tool for Dr. Haaland
would be to write an occasional
letter to the Gettysburgian on what
he is doing and what is not only
his agenda for the College but his
vision for ourschool. I would even
be willing to let him use the
"Pachyderm's Pulpit" from time to
time.

A problem which has grown
tremendously in my short time
here at Gettysburg is the deep ani
mosity between the administration
and the Greek system. As a Greek,
I see a deep level of distrust which
has existed and is only growing.
The Greek system feels very un
certain and fears for its survival.
As the College cracks down on fra
ternities, drinking is increasing in
the dorms. I saw it last year, and I
see it even more this year. The
other day, as I walked past Stine
Hall, I found it interesting to hear

a freshman state, "I am tired of sit
ting in my room all weekend all
weekend getting wasted." Perhaps
Dr. Haaland, fraternities are not the
biggest problem when it comes to
substance abuse. With last week's
bushings in Ice House and even
Apple, it seems like students need
to be able to get out more. Last
year's transfer rate seemed very
high, and at this rate, it seems like
it will only grow higher. The Presi
dent should try to visit some
houses and talk to sorority bisters
about the future of Greeks at
Gettysburg's campus.
The leadership's problems

do not stop with students but with
the faculty and staff as well. With
the denial of tenure of Dr. Edward
DeCIair of the Political Science
Department and the sudden firings
of two librarians, confidence in the
administration has dropped among
the higher levels. Working in a
College department, I hear com
plaints day after day.
For those who do not know,
Dr. DeCIair is one of the most in
teresting and finest professors at
Gettysburg. While his teaching
style is rather unorthodox, his Eu
ropean Union Class dominates the
simulation year after year, and
when tenure was denied, students
across campus rallied to his side.
Sadly, he will leave at the end of
the year so I suggest students try
to take a class of his before he goes.
He will make you talk, and he will
make you mad, but you will learn.
It is a shame that a professor can
be that popular to have student
petitions started but have Penn Hall
ignore our wishes. We pay the
bills; please do not forget that.

As for the librarians, this is
not a business; it is a community.
A community where we live, work,
and learn. With as much waste as
I see here, those librarians who
work hard and were loved by many
students did not need to go. Rather
than relieve the librarians, let's
start with some of the waste, such
as last year's Student Senate spon
sored one thousand dollar activism
speaker or five hundred dollar
GECO speaker. I could get Pat
Buchanan, or even Jesse Jackson
for you lefties, to come talk about

activism. Guess what-they would
not want a dime.
President Haaland and the
entire administration need to spend
less timeworrying about
multiculturism and diversity and
more time working on the prob
lems of Gettysburg College today.
We have to lift our morale, and if
the President and his team do open
up more, then we students must
work with Penn Hall and talk back.
President Haaland can not be ev
erywhere, but if he were to cut
back on some of his sabbaticals
then that would be a start.

Consider this ....

Soon we will all be facing a
_dificult question. A question that
will test our moral and ethical char¬

acter. A forum will be held next
Thursday to debate the death pen
alty. Every student, professor and
member of the college community
should attend.
Not only is the discussion of
capital punishment a challenging
and intriguing debate that forces
one to evaluate the meaning of life,
but it is an issue that we as a com
munity may have to wrestle with
in an intimate fashion in the com
ing months.
Beginning next month, our
classmate and friend will be on
trial for first _iegree murder.
_Prosecuters may try for the death
penalty if he is convicted.
Each and every one of us
will be forced to carefully consider
the consequences of the death pen
alty in a very personal way. The
national debate on captial punish
ment that has been raging for years
will finally hit close to home.

No matter what our personal
beliefs may be, we will all have to
make tough decisions in the com
ing weeks.
The key is to make a defi
nite decision.

Often we choose the middle
path to "be safe." This is the easi
est, and often the most taken, route.
As educated, enlightened individu
als we should try to see all sides
of an argument.
Although it is good to rec
ognize the many sides to a debate,
sooner or later we all must make a
choice and take a stand.
Should Brian Peterson die?
Should Timothy McVeigh die?
Where is the fine line that decides
who should and should not die?
There are large factions both
for and against the death penalty.
Where you stand depends
very much on how you were
brought up, your religious beliefs,
and your moral background.
Some people agree with the
death penalty because they believe
that it is a waste of taxpayers'
money to house prisoners.

Others believe two wrongs
don't make a right; an eye should
not be taken for an eye. For them,
the death penalty is simply cruel
and unusual punishment, a viola
tion of the Constitution itself.
Stop living in a foggy haze,
go to the forum, and continue the
debate in your classes and dorms.

Sara says :
get involved

bySaraSpr enkle
Managing Editor

the first year's relatively easy
classes cause an unfounded belief
that one can take on many more
activities than before.
I know I get a lot of flack
from my friends about being too
involved, but some of them are too
involved themselves. What I won
der is what are all the other people
doing? It seems that I could give
up some of my activities to some
one else.
SAC is given such a hard
time about concerts, etc., but very
few people put in the time to get
those events organized.
The Center for Public Ser
vice has lots of different events.
Involvement at CPS means getting
to know people from the College,
as well as the local community.
Service Learning trips are a great
opportunity to go off campus to a
place that you might not otherwise
get to travel to.

Enough about the pioblems
of this campus. Well, soit of
Enough about the usual complaints
about Gettysburg College.
Sara says: On a small cam
pus like this where we clamor for
more opportunities for alternative
activities, why are people not more
involved in organizations around
campus?
The opportunities are abun
dant and it's quite easy to get in
volved, but there are always people
who want something different,
something that Gettysburg College
doesn't offer yet. Not that that is
bad, if the grumblers then work to
form the groups that are wanted.
These ambitious people are
causing the number of student or
ganizations to increase. I've al
ready seen many signs for the
Japanese Club and the Civil War
Club membership drives.

New organizations seem to
get a lot of devoted members early
on (hey, it's new, it's different), but
then they disappear. Maybe mem
berships dwindle and interest is
lost. Students have that kind of
reputation. (Speaking of reputa
tions, did anyone else catch that
Link's articles about Generation X
were very sexually skewed? If you
hadn't thrown your copy on the
mail room floor, you would have
noticed!)
There hasn't been much
noise from last year's very vocal
group, Students for Ethical Action.
Last year, the student digest con
stantly had notices about their next
meeting.
This year's fad seems to be
the campus radio station WZBT
91.1. The turnout of people who
wanted radio shows was the larg
est it's ever been. What's the big
attraction for the station? WZRT

has drawn in all classes of student,
not just first-years, the much
sought after warm bodies who still
are interested and want to get in
volved before classes get too tough
and they get too involved in their
major. The involvement roller
coaster seems to peak in the sopho
more year when confidence from

Being involved doesn't nec
essarily mean joining an organiza
tion. There are plenty of other
ways to get involved without hav
ing a strict meeting schedule to
adhere to.
You'd be amazed how pro
fessors notice what you do. (Of
course, when you screw up, they
might mention it to you, but they
still know what you arc doing.
When you do something good,
they notice that too.) Attending
Common Hours and Faculty Meet
ings does not go unnoticed.
Common Hour attendance is
terribly small (not that I'm not
guilty of the peccadillo). I think I
have only attended five Common
Hours in my two years here, al
though I have attended nearly all
the Mathematics & Computer Sci
ence department's colloquia.

Unfortunately, there seems
to be a lack of respect for faculty
among some students. Although
occasionally there will be some
interest in a professor (like the
clamoring for Dr. DeClair's tenure
or a large turnout for a professor's
last lecture), students lack respect
for faculty, like the faculty owe stu
dents something for their tuition
dollars. (How many of us have
actually used this argument when
we don't do so well on a test?)
What does this have to do

with being involved? Becoming a
teacher's assistant or going to de
partment colloquia allow a student
to know a professor on a totally
new level. Conversations are not
limited to the classroom. Surpris
ingly enough, many professors
have favorite sports teams that they
are more than willing to talk about.
(I mean, they do lecture, among
other things, for a living, so they
should be good conversationalists.)
This is a small campus, duh,
but we tend to get set in our ways
and not meet as many people. We

run into the same people on a daily
basis, and we get stuck in our ruts
with our groups. Being involved
means meeting new people.
Want to gain the respect of
your peers? Go to sports events.
Attendance is smaller than at most
high schools. Even our "big"
sports, like football, men's basket
ball, and lacrosse, don't get that
much support. Gettysburg has
some of the best athletics teams in
the Centennial Conference, but
they don't attract as many fans as
some of the worse teams.

Okay, so I may be a little
bitter that the activities that I am
involved in are having trouble at
tracting new blood, but that's okay.
I know these things fluctuate, and
our time will come. I just don't
want to hear anyone else say that
there is nothing to do on campus.
You just have to look for it.
Get involved.
Oh, I mean, Sara says, "Get
involved."
If you don't like this article
and think 10,000 monkeys on
10,000 typewriters could write a
more cohesive story, I dare you to
have a better opinion. E-mail the
Gettysburgian at
burgian@gettysburg.edu with your
idea for a column. Get involved.

Congratulations to Rob
Kraft (Tau Kappa Epsilon) and
James Lobsenz (Phi Gamma
Delta) who were named as new
additions to the Greek Judicial
Board this week. Derek Reed and
Paul Koether were named as alter-

Grcek Week-Get Psyched!
In less than two weeks, Greek
Week shall begin, and everyone
watch out. The week is action
packed and filled with many Greek
students participating in some
times silly but always fun activi
ties. Beware of runaway beds on
Constitution Avenue, enjoy our
interpretation of a truly,Greek
Olympics, and don't miss an out
rageous lip-synching contest as the
grand finale. Folks, this is what
the Greek system is all about. In
fact, we can't think of a better rep
resentation of Greek life on this

nates. On Sunday, September 21,
Gamma Phi Beta and Sigma Al
pha Epsilon will be holding a char
ity Softball tournament. There is a
$50 entrance fee for each team and
a $ 1 spectator fee for those who
just want to watch. Registration
will be in the CUB all week, and
everyone is encouraged to partici
pate or just come and watch. We
guarantee it will be a great time,
and all money raised will be con
tributed to charity.
Miss your Greek Men of
Gettysburg Calendar last year?
Well, lucky for you it is still not
too late to purchase one at the CUB
for the low, low price of $2!
Gamma Phi Beta created this cal
endar last year and still has a few
copies left over, so go out and buy
them soon. Supplies are limited!
Once again, all proceeds from the
sales of the calendar will go to
charity.

campus, so don't miss any of the
events. Check out the schedule of
events located in this issue of The
Gettysburgian.
Something new this year for
Greek Week is the scavenger hunt.
It was traditionally an event but
was discontinued until this year.
Collect as many of the items on the
list provided, and the team with the
most points will win the event
The event will be divided between
sororities and fraternities, and the
top three teams will earn Greek
Week points. We would share
some_'of the items to be collected.

but we don t want to ruin the sur
prise for all of you.
Finally, just another re
minder that the Panhel meetings
have been changed to Mondays at
6:15 in CUB 260, and this week's
IFC meeting will be Monday at
8:30 at Alpha Tau Omega.
If anyone would like to have
anything mentioned in our column,
please let us know, we would love
to hear from you.

A reminder for sorority
women: applications for the
Panhel sponsored service learning
scholarship for any Greek woman
will be made available at the next
Panhel meeting.

From the donkey's mouth:
Helms's one-man
government

byMattBr own
Contributing Writer
You know, I do not think any
of us has ever learned in any
American Government or any po
litical science class that one sena
tor, one committee chairman in
Congress could be as powerful as
the President of the United States
and single-handedly veto the
president's decisions. However, if
you have ever watched events un
fold in our nation's capital over the
summer and just this past Monday,
you have learned that Senator
_Jes._ie Helms do3_s in effect have

quasi-power to veto President
Clinton's decisions. Over the
summer, you have seen the chair
man of the Senate Foreign Rela
tions committee, Senator Jesse
Helms, effectively veto President
Clinton's choice for Ambassador
to Mexico, former Massachusetts
Governor William Weld. On Mon
day, the nation saw that Mr.
Helms's refusal culminated in
Governor Weld's withdrawal of
his name for consideration to the
important post, a decision that has
upset many in Congress and many
across the nation.

How can this ultra-conser
vative Republican senator from
North Carolina end Weld's nomi
nation? Well, Senator Helms has
the power to not hold a confirma
tion hearing, the first step the sen
ate must take to fulfill its Consti
tutional duty to confirm the
President's nominations. In his
refusal to hold this necessary hear
ing Helms effectively hijacked the
process by which our government
approves political appointments.
As chairman he is allowed to wield
this great power and disrupt our
country's foreign policy. This he
is able to do despite the objections
of member of his committee and
of his very own Republican party.
Where did Senator Helms get this
power? Certainly not in the Con
stitution, rather this power is in the
rules that the Republicans, as the
majority party, get to set that gov¬

ern the business of the Senate. If
one man can do this, hold up the
confirmation process, maybe it's
time to consider a little reform in
the rules.
let's be fair though, why
don't we take a second to consider
Governor Weld. Perhaps this mod
erate Republican really is as ter
rible and unworthy of being an
ambassador to our neighbor and
friend to the south. Now, Helms's
whole reason to hold up Weld's
nomination was because he did not
believe Weld's record on drug
fighting was strong enough. He
believes, but repeatedly denies it,
that Weld is too moderate. Well,
why not hold a public confirmation
hearing? If Governor Weld is re
ally not suitable, why not show the
whole country Mr. Helms? The
reason why there were no hearing
was that Helms and other conser
vatives like him did not want to

expose their weakness—that there
is no real reason that Weld should
notbe ambassador. Weld has re
peatedly proven himself to be a
good leader as Massachusetts's
governor and as an attorney and as
an attorney at the federal and state
levels. The people of Massachu
setts seem to think he's a good
enough crime fighter to re-elect
him and give him good marks in
opinion polls. Weld must be doing
something right to enjoy support
from both sides of the aisle. Some
of his most ardent supporters have
been Democrats: John Kerry, his

opponent for the U.S. Senate, and
Ted Kennedy also from his home
state. If William Weld had faced
the fires of confirmation, he would
have won overwhelming support
from Democrats and centrist Re
publicans. Americans do not share
Jesse Helms's and other ultra-con
servative Republican's vision of
America and what her policies
should be. Mr. Helms seems to
think that he speaks for all of us
when he knows how important it
is that our Ambassador to Mexico
have a closed mind to the possibil
ity that marijuana may indeed have
beneficial medicinal uses. It seems

that the medicinal establishment
agrees more with Mr. Weld's
stance on marijuana that on Mr.
Helm's support of tobacco use.
It's even questionable that
Helms's, a known racist, who used
race bating to get re-elected in
1990, should hold a position in
Foreign Relations when by its
very nature the job requires good
skills with people of other races.
Governor Weld should have been
heading for Mexico City this week
and Mr. Helms should be heading
back to North Carolina. Leaders
who are so partisan that they
would halt our democratic pro
cesses for their own selfish politi
cal ends have no place in our
nation's leadership.
It's not William Weld who
lost this week, it's the American
people. We Americans lost a man
who would have been a fine leader
in a pivotal diplomatic position.

We saw how one man can affect
the way our nation conducts its
business. Partisan politics contin
ues even as President Clinton
reached out and chose a Republi
can for a top diplomatic post. The
effectiveness of President
Clinton's foreign policy through
all this adversity continues to be
strong. The senate, including
Jesse Helms, continues to follow
the strong leadership of President
Clinton and Secretary of State
Albright in the foreign policy
arena, especially on Most Favored
Nation status for China, the role

of U.S. troops in the Dayton Peace
accords and out role in the Mid
East Peace talks. Governor Weld
will not be out of the picture very
long. Although he has said he will
not seek another position in the
Clinton Administration indica
tions point to his returning to pub
lic service soon. Weld is a strong
moderate leader for a strong mod
erate America, who was an ex
ample of courage standing up to
the right. President Clinton will
continue his strong leadership in
the foreign policy arena and cer
tainly will have just as strong a
candidate forAmbassador soon.

You 'd never know
that Mother Teresa
died; Princess Di
takes the cake

By AurenHof finan
On the back page of every
newspaper was the biggest story of
the week: Mother Teresa, after a
lifetime of love and achievement,
died. But unless you really paid
attention, you would have thought
that the only person who died last
week was Princess Diana — be
cause she was on the front page of
each of those newspapers and
magazines. Diana's death was
very tragic (especially considering
her youth). Famous people who
die young (James Dean, Jack
Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe) in a
tragic death usually instantly
double their popularity. But con
sidering Diana let herself be driven
around by a man far drunker than
the legal limit (who drove 4 times
the legal speed limit), her death
was not just an accident — it was
bad judgement.

Two of the most famous
women of the world died that week
and their lives could not have been
more different. Diana, gorgeous
and vibrant, was born to a gentile
old-money family. She married
the Prince, then divorced, and then
led a life photo-ops.
Mother Teresa (born Agnes
Gonza Bojaxhiu) was certainly no
beauty. She was short, very aver
age, and born to grocery store
worker in Macedonia. She mar
ried the Catholic Church and never
got divorced. In the almost 70
years since Mother Teresa made
her commitment, she never wa
vered. Diana brought recognition
to many of the world's problems -
- and for this she should be com
mended. But Mother Teresa actu
ally helped solve some of the
world's problems. She built over
500 hospitals in over 100 countries
to help the poor. She fought the

Calcutta slums. She inspired mil
lions to do good. She did this not
with glamour or for self-want ~
she did this because she cared.
Maybe some Americans
who sit in front of the tabloid tele
vision, the Dateline NBC Hard
Copy Sally Jesse Opera Prime
Time Live marathon that persists
everyday, never heard of Mother
Teresa. Maybe some people don't
know her good deeds are her help
ing combat disease, isolation, and
poverty.
But these same Americans
probably know of the nasty divorce
he.tween Di nnd Charles.

That's sad.
That's really sad.
Some people might blame
the press for promoting Diana,
scandal, andother non-issues -- but
the media is not blame. We are to
blame. It is a sad fact that putting
the beautiful Diana on the cover
of Newsweek is going to sell more
magazines than the old Mother
Teresa. When the people of this
country are clamoring for garbage
- that is what the free market is
going to give them. Garbage has
infiltrated our market - even some
notable publications (like
Newsweek and Time) appeal to the
lowest common denominator.

Though it is understandable
for Americans to look up AT the
glamour and the royalty of a Prin
cess — most Americans should
look up TO people like Mother
Teresa. And though most of us will
never be as devoted or have as
much impact as Mother Teresa,
many of us will live much happier
lives than Princess Di.

Could it ever really happen?

BySteveJenldns
Sports Editor
It's Friday night. You are
kickin' il dance party somewhere
on campus, and the most
bodacious woman you have ever
seen in your life, looks at your
studly, yet smooth body and says,
" Hey what to you think about
Roger Maris' record? Will it ever
be broken?."
Your eyes were glowing
with anticipation with the hopes
that maybe, just maybe, she was
going to ask you out to LD's to
share a Lumberjack special. "Uh,
uh..." you stumble. Not realizing
what you are about to mutter you
say," Oh that record is going down
the tubes... Can you say Ken
Griffey Jr."
"Nah, nah, nah," she says,
"Griffey and McGwire were good
this year, but not good enough, the
way I see it that record will stand

Not wanting to offend her in
anyway (because her personality is
overwhelming you) you say, "
Look, have you seen the size of
Mark McGwire's arms, the gov
ernment makes him carry a special
license for that kind of weaponry.
And Griffey, shoot, if that boy hit
any more bombs, they would have
to call him World War Junior."
After your witty response,
you figure you have stolen her
heart, swept her off of her feet and
garaunteed yourself a woman.

"Ahh, too many injuries..." she re
plies as she throws her hair back
over her shoulder.
"What... what did you say?
Did you say they get hurt too
much?" Dumbfounded, you step
back and realize that she has made
a point. Ken Griffey Jr., Mark
McGwire, Albert Belle, and Frank
Thomas (some of the most preva
lent power hitters in the game)
have all missed a number of games
in the last two seasons that may
have kept them from eclipsing the
great mark of sixty one "dongs" in

a season.
"That was just dumb luck,"
you retort, "there is always next
season." Yes, you finally made a
good point. So they missed a few
games here and there. That doesn't
mean that they will never break the

record. You are set. Nothing like
breakfast in bed.
"Ah but do you think that it
is neccesary to play all 164 games
in a major league season to do it?"
she asks. "I mean Cecil Fielder
was the last player to come even
close he hit 51 homers in 1990, and
he only missed a few games that
year." "No!" you say. "Roger
Maris only played in 154 games
the season that he hit his 61 round
trippers. Griffey or McGwire
could do it. Not a problem." You
stare into her eyes, and you can see
that in her innermost soul she
knows that you are right. The
record will be broken; it is just a
question of when.
"I guess you are right," she
admits, "but sixty- two homers is
alot. Let's say that a player bats 4
times per game, and he plays 165
games. That means barring any in
jury, and playing a full season, a
player would have to hit one
homerun every 10.64516129 at
bats. Now that is impressive."

Impressive indeed. This
woman has just spurted some in
formation at you that seems like
some foreign language, and the
fact is, she is right. To hit sixty
homeruns, a player who plays ev
ery day, never slumps, and who
sees the ball as big as a water
melon, would have to hit a
homerun once every 10 or 11 times
he steps up to the plate. Wow.
It is hard enough to get a
basehit in the major leagues, not
to mention a homerun. The fact
that Roger Maris achieved this
small miracle in 11 less games than
professionals now play is a won
der to modern sports. This is what
you have to explain to her, that
Roger Maris' feat was glorious, but
some day it will be broken.
"Records are made to be

broken, you say, it is just a mat
ter of time... somebody will do it."
You've got her. You have changed
her mind, and she is yours for as
long as you can keep her inter
ested. Baseball is so universal, you
can even talk to girls about it."
"So what are you doing
now?" she asks, "I thought we
could go get something to eat,
maybe LD's." PAYDIRT. Bring

on the Lumberjack special. You
see there are a few things in life
that remain sacred. Some think
that Roger Maris' record will for
ever remain untouched, and some
think that it will be broken. The
record for homeruns in a season is
61. A number that may never be
reached again. You, yourself, will
be the one who has to decide.
So the next time a luschious,
beautiful, bomshell of a woman
comes up to you and asks you, "
What do you think of Ken Griffey
Jr?" tell her, "Hey, he's good, and
the record, well, only time will
tell." You are almost gauranteed
to be the highlight of the party, and
women will be throwing them
selves at your feet!

Mens
soccer fired
up for tough
season

from the Gettysburg '97 Men' s
soccer preview
This season, many pieces
appear to be there for Gettysburg
College to have another succesful
men's soccer campaign in 1997.
The top three scorers from
last year's squad are all back. That
includes Gregory Stevcic, who al
ready holds the school record for
career goals. The trio of Stevcic,
Brian Hill and Chris Pryor com
bined to score twenty goals and
dish out 13 assists last season.
Aaron Jolin, used as both a
forward and a midfielder in his first
season at Gettysburg, responded
by supplying the Bullets with two
goals and five assists. The coach
ing staff is looking for Matt Kelly,
who collected three goals and five
assists last year, to have his finest

season this year.
Also returning for the Bul
lets is John Katerba, who started
all 18 games last season in goal.
He was credited with 83 saves and
allowed just 14 goals in 1, 633
minutes, and tied a school record
for shutouts in a season.
The area that was hit hard
est by graduation was the defense.
Noah Simon, a four year starter
and the 1996 Centennial Confer
ence Player of the Year, and Scott
Metzger both concluded their ca
reers with the Bullets last season.
That leaves Josh Rubinich and
Derrich May as the only returning
backs with more than one start in
their careers, although Jumpin'
John Malcolm, who appeared in 15
games last season, has shown he
has the tools to be a solid Division

III defensive back.
Thus far in the season the
Bullets are 3-2, and are playing
quite well. With a few more games
to gel as a unit, and get the shots
blastin' there is no telling what this
bunch of athletes can do.

Tri this on for size...

by Chesha Miller
Staff Writer Few students take on as
much as Kelly Haberstroh. Last
year there were five, but with the
turn of the semester there ore only
two left and Haberstroh is the only
student. What, you may ask, are
there so few of? Triathletes. Kelly
Haberstroh and Professor Scott
Johnson are the two remaining
triathletes on Gettysburg's cam
pus. A triathlo is a race consist
ing of swimming, biking, and run¬

ning. There are a few different
types of triathlons and each type
has a different mileage for the three
disciplines. The Sprint Distance
Triathlon, which is a typical dis
tance and the most common type
of race, consists of a half mile
swim, followed by a twenty mile
bike, and finally a five mile run.
Olympic Distance races have a .9
mile swim, a 25 mile bike, and a
6.2 mile run. The final type of
triathlon is the Half-Ironman,
which involves a 1.2 mile swim,
56 mile, bike, and then a 13 mile
run. Whew!!

Haberstroh is indeed a brave
person to take on all that! She be
gan her career as a triathlete dur
ing her senior year of high school.
In high school, Haberstroh swam
and ran in addition to playing soc
cer. She also found herself with a
natrual talent for biking. Her first
race, held close to her New Jersey
home, was very successful.
Haherstroh has been hooked ever

. Since that first race, she has
competed in over 30 triathlons,
taking place primarily in southern
New Jersey along with a few in
Pennsylvania. Most often she
competes in the Sprint Distance
triathlons, however her favorite
distance is the Half-Ironman.
Haberstroh explains, "It asks the

most ot your mind and your body,
but gives the most in return."
Becoming a triathlete takes
a lot of work, dedication, and fo
cus. "Competing in a triathlon is
a humbling experience. You really
have to learn to respect your body
on the highest level," says
Haberstroh. "If you don't treat
your body right, it will refuse to
perform for you when you need it
to race, usually for over 6 hours.
There's a lot of give and take."
Such grueling competition re
quires a ton of training.
Haberstroh creates her own work¬

outs, which she says require a lot
of time and energy.
In the fall and spring, she
works mostly on her running. She
enjoys spending most of her time
running through the battlefields
with some tr_^ck and some hill
workouts interspersed. During the
winter months, Haberstroh uses a
windtrainer device which allows
her to ride her own bicycle as a sta
tionary unit indoors. Of the three
disciplines involved, Haberstroh
feels her swimming suffers most,
as she would rather dedicate most
of her time to running.

Haberstroh has learned a
great deal about herself and per
forming by competing in athletics,
triathlons in particular. Athletics
have taught Haberstroh discipline
and determination, as well as to
respect her body. Last spring,
Haberstroh trained really hard to
run a marathon. She was running
up to 55 miles per week and was
not paying enough attention to the
needs of her body.
On the day of the race, at the
17 mile mark, her knees gave out
on her and she was unable to con
tinue due to the extreme pain she
was experiencing in her legs which
would carry her no further. "I
learned to respect my limitations
that day, because I now have ma
jor knee injuries that I have to deal
with."

Shown here on her bike,
Kelly Haberstroh races
madly to the finish
line...Something she has
pone thirty times.

Haberstroh most recently
raced on Sunday, September 7, in
the Seven Presidents' Triathlon in
Long Branch, New Jersey. The
race, which was in the sprint dis
tance, had a field of approximately
100 women competing.
Haberslroh was in 7th place after
the half mile swim.
Then, like Speedy Gonzales,
she moved into second place after
biking for twenty miles. "They
hung me out to dry on the [five
mile] run," explains Haberstroh. "I
ended up in something like 13th
place overall." Without the offi
cial results, Haberstroh does not
know her official place overall.
She did, however, win the college
division of the race, finshing in
only one hour and twenty minutes.

Kelly Haberstroh is involved
in a number of other activities on
campus. The senior is an econom
ics and accounting double major,
who has high hopes of working for
a Big Six firm in Washington D.C.
Presently she is a teacher's assis
tant for the economics department,
where she teaches a
microeconomics lab. She is also
president of Omnicron Delta
Epsion, the Economics Honor So
ciety. In addition to all that,
Haberstroh is employed by cam
pus recreation and is a Big Broth
ers/Big Sisters volunteer.
Haberstroh is constantly supported
by her family in her triathlons. Her
mother, Diane, even created a spe
cial calendar for her which con
tains pictures of Haberstroh com
peting. Haberstroh is also faith
fully championed by her twin
brother Josh, her older brother Ja
son, and her dad, Gary.
Kelly Haberstroh is an ex
tremely dedicated athlete who has
a great deal of patience, courage
and mental stamina. We at the
Gettysburgian salute Haberstroh
and support her in all of her
triathlons. Way to go, Kelly!

Football drops hammer on Hampden-Sydney; win 33-7

JoshEyler Assistant Sports Editor

How did our football team
do this past weekend? To put it
quite bluntly, the Gettysburg Bul
lets kicked posterior, and took
names in a 33 to 7 victory over
Hampden-Sydney. Or to put it as
resident expert "Sweet Lou"
Lunardi does: "You know we blew
'em out cause I got to play."
The offense this week was a
machine. Our Bullets scored in
every quarter. Paul "2 Legit 2
Quit" Smith ran for 206 all pur
pose yards. Somewhere in that
total can be found a sparkling 37
yard touchdown run that left
Hampden-Sydney dumbfounded.
Matt Hel wig gathered 137 all pur
pose yards and scored twice, once
from 1 yard away and once from 5
yards. Derek "I'm just a boy from
da' hood" Reed scored his first col
legiate touchdown on a 2 yard run.
Said Reed: "I was gonna do a
dance, but I was too tired."

nor Gurski (8 tackles), they left
Hampden-Sydney crying for their
mammas. Jason "Mad-dog"
Osborn (6 tackles), "Mean" Gene
Kraus (9 tackles) and "Fightin"'
Joe Hodakowski (5 tackles)
rounded out the defensive ram
page. This issue should undoubt
edly be dedicated to another group
of guys, however. The five guys
that protect "Tony the Hair"
Fugaro and keep Smith and
Helwig from being torn up in the
backfield, they played exception
ally well this last game. These are
the guys that are constantly being
hit and bruised and, at the same
time, are hitting and bruising back:
the offensive linemen. They never
get enough credit, so now it is time
they get a little "somethin'
somethin'."

Right tackle Bill "The Ani
mal" Beining had four pancakes
versus Hampden-Sydney. A pan
cake, for those unfamiliar with the
term, is basically when an O-line
man knocks the snot out of a de
fensive lineman and leaves him
sitting on his buttocks. "Wild
Man" Scaffidi also had a pancake
while Bryan "Fancy Feet" Willard
and Kurt Ritter knocked the wind

On the other side of the ball,
the Bullets were unstoppable. Led
by Matt "Putting on the" Ritz (10
tackles), Chris "Fellyoooo" Felton
(9 tackles), and Kevin "The War-

out of the defense all day long. But
best of all, in the second quarter,
Justin "All dat and a bag o' chips"
Ogorek, my hero, jumped on a
Helwie fumble in the endzone, and

This week the "horses'
patooties" from Western Maryland
come to the 'Burg on Saturday at
1:30 in Musselman Stadium.
Come out, cheer the team on, and

when number 99 takes the field for
Western Maryland call him every
foul name you can think of because
he thinks he's going to take out our
quarterback. Yeah right.
