College consoles after crisis

by Henry Fawell
Staff Writer In the hours following the shock
ing death of 19 year-old student Casey
Dunn, Gettysburg College was quick to
reach out and support those members
of the student body, faculty and admin
istration most afflicted by the sudden
tragedy. Despite the overwhelming
sense of confusion and disbelief which
set in late Saturday night, several offices
in the administration immediately of
fered a helping hand to both friends and
peers in need of comfort and solace.
Saturday night, after the death was
confirmed by the Borough Police, the
residents of Corner Cottage, where

Dunn resided, were informed of the
incident which occurred at approxi
mately 9:30 p.m. Immediately follow
ing the announcement, Pastor Joseph
Donnella and Assistant Chaplain Bill
Gohl opened Christ Chapel on a
twenty-four hour basis for those in
need. All members of the faculty were
immediately contacted, as well.
On Sunday morning the Chapel
held a memorial service attended by
many friends and peers, including mem
bers of Alpha Xi Delta sorority and Al
pha Phi Omega fraternity, both of which
Dunn was a member. Faculty members
and administrators were also in atten
dance. Members of the Counseling Ser
vice and Residence Life joined Donnella
and Gohl by offering their assistance in

the chapel throughout the day and
evening.
In order to quell any uncertainty
filtering through the campus on Sun
day, Dean Julie Ramsey issued a for
mal, campus-wide statement via email
defining the situation. Ramsey ex
plained the incident, including the facts
uncovered at the time and what sup
port services were to be offered to those
who were in need of guidance.
Dr. Bill Jones of the Counseling
Services stated that his office, "received
as many calls [Sunday and Monday] as
was expected during a time of crisis."
Counseling was available to all groups
in need, particularly Alpha Xi Delta and
Alpha Phi Omega, and will continue to
be so as long as it is needed.

Monday saw several classes can
celed, evidence that faculty were well
aware of the impact Saturday night's
events had on the students. In fact, a
number of professors canceled classes
because of their own personal ties to
Dunn. Of the classes that did continue,
however, several absences were evident.
Yet, many professors took the time to
speak with students about Dunn and
how to cope with such shocking news.
Marcie DePalma, President of Al
pha Xi Delta, said, "Every one was re
ally great, It was really shocking the way
people were helping out. People we
didn't even know were offering us their
support. There was just a whole lot of
love."

Student commits suicide

by Sara Sprenkle
Managing Editor
On Saturday, November 4,
sophomore Casey I. Dunn hanged
herself in her dormitory room in
Corner Cottage.
At 9:20 that evening, Gettys
burg Police were called to Corner
Cottage for an apparent suicide.
Dunn was taken to Gettysburg
Hospital where she was pronounced
dead at 9:55 p.m.
Police treated the death as a
suicide and had no reason to suspect
that foul play was involved, Gettys
burg Police Chief Fred Gantz told
the Hanover Evening Sun.
Drugs and alcohol did not play
a significant, if any, role in Dunn's
suicide.
Dunn's approximate time of
death was between 8:30 to 9:10 pm,
said Adams County Coroner Pat
Leinbach.

After Dunn s identity was con
firmed, Chaplain Joseph Donnella

called her parents.
As soon as all information
was verified, Dean Julie Ramsey
sent out a campus-wide e-mail at
12:30 am to quash any rumors
and direct students on how to get
help if counseling was needed.
About 150 people attended
a 2 am prayer service Sunday, just
four hours after Dunn was de
clared dead.
Two viewings were held at
2-4 pm and at 7-9 pm. Dunn's
sisters in Alpha Xi Delta and
brothers in Alpha Phi Omega
placed her pins on her for burial.
Dunn's funeral was held
Tuesday, November 4 at 10 am
in St. Anthony's of Padua Church
in Baltimore. Gettysburg College

was well-represented as fifty stu
dents, several faculty, Ramsey,
and Assistant Chaplain Bill Gohl
attended, while Donnella and
Father Brian Conrad participated
in the mass.
Led by Donnella, Gohl, and

page 4

Conrad, a memorial service for
the campus community was held
at 5 pm later that evening. The
information of the service was not
released publicly since the service
was intended for the campus com
munity. About 750 students, fac
ulty, staff, and administrators at
tended the service.
Dunn's roommate, along
with Aynsley Hamel, and several
members of Alpha Phi Omega,
who volunteered to take tickets at
the Fiona Apple concert Saturday
night, left Corner Cottage around
7:20 pm before Dunn's 8:30 ar
rival from shopping at Cranberry
Mall wiht two 1997 graduates
from Gettysburg College.

Casey Dunn remembered

by Chesha Miller
Staff Writer Casey Dunn had a huge
heart. She reached out to many
different people on campus and
significantly changed their lives.
A huge force in whatever activ
ity she undertook, she shared her
love and enthusiasm in the class
room, with her Alpha Xi Delta
sisters, Alpha Phi Omega broth
ers, fellow tour guides, choir
members, and Gettysburgian
staffer members.
No matter what that
Casey did, her infectious smile
and laughter brought joy to all
who had the pleasure of know
ing her.
If one thing is certain, it is
that Casey loved to help people.
She was always concerned with
taking care of everyone else. At
any time of the night Casey's
friends could count on her to be
there for them and to be willing
to give advice and help solve
their problems.

Through her weekly
"Dear Casey" column in The
Gettysburgian the entire campus
community benefitted from her
advice.
"Casey was always cheer
ing everyone up," said her soror
ity sister, Emily Leone, "she
made us laugh no matter what."
This sentiment was ech
oed by all of Casey's friends.
"She always listened to others'
problems and helped them in
any way she could. She was a
very kind and giving person,"
commented another of Casey's
sisters, Shelby Hockenberry.
Alec Beekmans, Casey's
Alpha Phi Omega brother, said
"She is one of several people I
know who majored in finding
out about other people. She did
a whole lot to make sure that

people felt special. I believe that
she is still very interested in our
lives- she is just now watching
them from a different vantage
point."
A deep desire to make sure
her friends were doing well was
present in all of Casey's actions.
If her friends were struggling,
Casey was always on hand to
share a cup of tea or a conversa¬

tion over a long walk.
If she felt she couldn't per
sonally provide comfort she
knew she could always count on
Assistant Chaplain Bill Gobi's
help. "Casey would come into
my office seven days a week and
tell me who needed help, who I
should see, and who I should
send others to see," Bill Gohl
explained. That was who Casey
was, the person who always went
the extra mile for anyone who
might need her assistance.
Casey cheered her friends
up in a great variety of ways.
"She loved to embroider," ex
plained Julie Wilmer, "she made
many of us some very special
things." For Julie (who admit
ted that she often spills things on
her self) Casey made a bib with
the words "for when you spill"
embroidered on it. This semes
ter as Julie is not on campus,
Casey felt it was her job to help
keep Julie in the loop. She wrote
Julie the "Chronicles of Life in a

Coconut" regularly, which was
her own little newspaper describ
ing the news, sports and happen
ings at Gettysburg.
Casey loved to share her
self through her writing. She was
a true writer at heart, writing not
only for The Gettysburgian, but
also for herself. "Casey sent me
a few poems which she wrote
she was so eloquent," Julie com
mented.
Casey also made up her
own silly songs which she sang
and played along to with her
guitar. Open-mic night at the
coffee house was a favorite of
Casey's. She often got up with
her guitar and good friend,
Rebecca Babbitt, to sing her
spoofs, even though many times
these songs were sung off key.
In addition to being a con
stant support to her friends,
Casey was herself a true indi
vidual. She demonstrated her
individualism in everything she
did from what she ate, to how
she dressed and acted.

Even her speech was
unique. Casey's favorite word
was "Dude!" She used it inces
santly and something would
have seemed amiss had Casey
not begun a sentence with an
emphatic "Dude!"

Casey was an individual
on a campus that reeks of con
formity," commented Alec
Beekmans, "Casey was never
afraid to be herself and I greatly
admired her for this."
Beekmans also had the
pleasure of being Casey's first
director in one of her lunch time
one-act plays. "I was fortunate
enough to know Casey as an ac
tress, an APO pledge and
brother, a writer, a tour guide, a
supporter and a confidante,"
Alec explained.
Casey's individuality
shone bright in many aspects of
her life.. Sometimes quite liter
ally as in her neon green shirt and
silver pants, an outfit she pur
chased with her friends on a
Gettysburgian trip to New York
City. They promised her she
would never wear it, but Casey
proved them wrong, as was typi
cal of her nature. She sported
her shocking attire, if even only
to prove her friends wrong.

Casey was always doing
silly things to prove her points
and make people laugh," noted
her friend Kate Naughton.
"She was a unique indi
vidual with a very independent
sense about her- she was one of
a kind," commented Ellen
Livingston, overseer of tours for
the Admissions Office.
"She's one of the most
unique, unforgettable people
that I've ever met," said Alpha
Phi Omega brother, Barb
Dickson, "Life without her will
never be the same."
Casey even brought her
own individuality into the food
she choose to eat. Her meals at
Servo always included some
"random, weird" concoction,
like frozen yogurt on top of corn
bread. She loved to take a walk
up to the Lincoln Diner for hot
fudge brownies with Barb
Dickson.

Casey's enjoyment of all
different types of food earned
her the fond nickname, "Pan
cake". She was given this spe
cial nickname after last spring's
Alpha Xi Delta annual pancake
supper at which Casey was a
"pancake making fool." She
cranked out many, many pan¬

cakes, but they were unlike any
pancakes her sisters had ever
seen before.
Casey managed to create
pancakes of every shape, size,
and color and even managed to
decorate the Chapel kitchen with
pancake batter. "Casey was the
only underclassman allowed to
cook [pancakes] and she loved
it. She even made up a funny
pancake song," explained Emily
Leone.
The sisterhood of Alpha Xi
Delta felt very blessed to have
Casey as their only formal rush
pledge last spring. "Casey was
so excited to wear her letters,"
explained close friend and Alpha
Xi big sister Aynsley Hamel, "she
ran up down the halls of Hanson
basement trying to convince ev
eryone to join."

Casey succeeded in that by
bringing 4 pledges to Alpha Xi
the very week after she became
a pledge. "It never got Casey
down that she was the only sis
ter that went through formal
rush last year," commented
Miranda Fegley, one of Casey's
fellow Alpha Xi pledges last
spring. "Casey always pulled Al
pha Xi together-she really
wanted us to bond as a sister
hood," Miranda said, "she ex
emplified what we stand for."
A bright light shinning in
her classrooms and in her jobs,
Casey was an exuberant person.
"[She] in several ways was an
ideal college student," com
mented English professor Chris
Fee. "She had enthusiasm and
desired to grow emotionally,
spiritually and academically."

This semester Casey was
taking a Medieval Renaissance
literature class with Professor Fee
and Women's History with Pro
fessor Cynthia Cupples of the
history department. "Casey kept
working back and forth between
the two," explained Professor
Cupples. "She made constant
connections and challenged
people to stop and think. Casey
was a vibrant presence inside the
classroom and out."
Casey was a definite force
in all of her classes. She could
be counted on to share her in
sight on any topic.

Casey was a special part of
English chairperson Dr. Eliza
beth Lambert's first year semi
nar last fall. "The whole class
was so special," commented Dr.
Lambert, "I will never forget that
class." Casey wrote a paper for
Dr. Lambert explaining her first
driving experience with her fa
ther. " It was wild. I think it
was not just a lesson, but a dec
laration of independence. She
was effervescent and possessed
a wonderful sparkle. I felt as
though she could handle any
thing," Dr. Lambert remarked.
Casey was a very hard
working, dedicated person. This
summer she remained on cam
pus and worked three jobs. On
campus she worked for Finance
and Administration. She was

also a tour guide for the admis
sions office. Ellen Livingston
who was pleased to have Casey
as an employee said, "she repre
sented our office and Gettysburg
College in a professional and
personable manner, and she re
ceived many positive accolades
to that effect from prospective
students and their families who
she toured."
In addition to her campus
employment, Casey worked for
the Gettysburg Times; a job she
was proud to have. Casey
worked for the Times as a pho
tographer and a journalist on the
occasions when her writing ex
pertise was needed.
An expert not only in writ
ing, but in making friends, Casey
left lasting impressions.

The first time Aynsley
Hamel met Casey was last fall at
Sigma Nu. The pair talked for a
while and eventually the discus
sion led to Casey's playing the
guitar. "I said that I'd always
wanted to learn how to play the
guitar," Aynsley explained, "and
she said, '—dude, come over, I'll
teach you.' I never got my gui
tar lessons, but I did get a best
friend. Casey was my little sis
ter in Alpha Xi and my big
brother in APO, but above all
that she was a friend of mine."

Suicide: know the warning signs

by Laura Root
Contributing Writer
Suicide is a leading cause
of death among young people.
In a 1991 survey of U.S. teens
by the Centers for Disease Con
trol, more than 27 percent ad
mitted that they had seriously
contemplated suicide in the
previous year. Eight percent
said that they had actually tried
to kill themselves during that
same period.
Today an estimated
276,000 people under the age

of 20 attempt suicide each year.
More than 5,000 of them suc
c e e d .
Young people who try to
kill themselves usually fall into
three groups. The first of these
groups include those who ap
pear to be well-adjusted, but
are living in stressful situations.
A person in the second
group is usually depressed and
/ or anxious. They could be
emotionally stressed by dealing
with substance abuse, problems
in school, or interpersonal loss.
The third group consists

of those who are impulsive,
aggressive, or self-destructive.
Impulsive acts are often linked
to suicide.
Drug and alcohol abuse
plays an especially large role in
the suicide of young people.
Recent studies have shown that
rates for suicide and attempted
suicide are five to twenty per
cent higher among substance
abusers than the general popu
lation. Many people who are
chemically-dependent do not
realize that their depression is
drug-related. They often think

that their feelings are just a re
flection of the way that things
really are.
Stress is another common
cause of suicide, especially in
the case of college students.
People with a lot of stress in
their lives may feel like there is
no escape from the pressure in
their life except for death.
Learning ways to cope with
stress can help remedy this
problem. Those dealing with
a lot of stress should seek pro
fessional help, talk about their
problem with others, take

breaks from working, learn to
relax, exercise regularly, plan
ahead, and be realistic in their
expectations of themselves.
The most important thing
to remember about suicide is
that it can be prevented. Most
people who are contemplating
suicide give off warning sings.
They may experience behav
ioral changes, including
changes in eating or sleeping
patterns, withdrawal from
friends and family, substance
abuse, loss of interest in favor
ite activities, or the giving away

of valued possessions.
Personality changes can
include anger, anxiety, depres
sion, aggressiveness, hopeless
ness, hypersensitivity, frequent
boredom_.problems concentrat
ing, or an unexplained decline
in school performance. Health
problems can also hint to sui
cide. Complaints to frequent
headaches, weight loss or gain,
nausea, or fatigue could involve
any serious illness that some
one might want to escape from.
People considering sui
cide want to end their pain, not

necessarily their lives. How
ever, they have given up hope
that anyone can help them. To
help someone who is consider
ing suicide, it is important to
talk openly with them. Asking
the person question can help
determine how serious he or
she is about wanting to end his
or her own life.
It is imperative to be a
good listener and look for non
verbal clues that might show
how a person is feeling. Be sure
to show the person that they
are loved and that someone will
always be there to listen to horn
or her.

Memories of a friend

Julie Wilmer, who was
Aynsley's roommate last year,
stayed up late talking with Casey
while drinking tea the first time
they met.
Anne Marie Moore, a fel
low tour guide of Casey's also
has a unique story about the first
time she met Casey. Anne Marie
as a veteran guide was to be
Casey's "buddy" and give her
her first practice tour.
Remembering Casey's first
practice tour, Anne Marie said,
"We were walking past the
chapel, and she turned to me and
said, '-Do you smoke?' I said,'—
yeah, would you like to bum
one?' I remember she said some
response with "dude" in it as she
pulled out her pack of menthols.
And, from there, we continued
Casey's first tour of the summer
She was a dear friend, and her
loss will be felt very deeply."

For Barb Dickson, who
lived next door to Casey last
year, their friendship was quite
accidental. "One day I was walk
ing to my room and walked
through her open door by mis
take. I was going to leave im
mediately, but she made me stay
and talk to her. That's really how
Casey was. She decided that she
wanted to make a friend, and she
did." Casey was a source of hap
piness on her first-year floor.
Resident Assistant Kate
Costellatalked about how Casey
was always thinking of other
people. "She used to make ban
ners for people on our floor
when their birthdays came
around. She was a constant pres
ence for me on the floor, always
stopping by to talk, and sharing
her thoughts openly with me.
We helped each other so much

continued from page 2
last year, and I will miss her."
Nat Gordon who also
lived on Casey's floor last year
was a member of Casey's Alpha
Xi pledge class. It was Casey
who, because of her great enthu
siasm, convinced Nat to join Al
pha Xi. "Casey was a special
person who was always there for
everyone else. She loved to talk
to and meet people, we could
never get her to shut up," Nat
said fondly. "The thing that
amazed me most about Casey
was that she never held any
grudges against anyone. She was
friends with everybody," Nat
continued.
This fall Casey decided to
take on yet another activity and
join Chapel Choir. Choir direc
tor Dr. Sharon Gratto com
mented on her first meeting with
Casey. "She was enthusiastic to

audition for me and to be a part
of the group," said Dr. Gratto,
"I distinctly remember her per
sonal introduction, like me and
a couple of other choir members,
she was from Baltimore, a city
that is a source of a rather amus
ing accent."
Excited to get involved
with the events of the Chapel
and to meet Gettysburg's new
chaplain, Pastor Joseph
Donnella, Casey was the first stu
dent on campus to introduce
herself to him. Commenting
"she was an introspective soul
who was concerned with justice
and making sure that everyone
around her was being treated
well," Pastor Donnella had noth
ing but fond thoughts of Casey.
On October 10th, Casey
gave her own homily at Candle
Light Communion. "Casey had
a firm belief in who she thought

God was and she liked to share
it," said Assistant Chaplain Bill
Gohl, "that gives me real com
fort, because it shows that Casey
knew where she was going."
Full of light and vibrancy,
Casey was enthusiastic about
people and their lives. She was
a true individual whose presence
will be sorely missed on
Gettysburg's campus. A selfless
person, Casey would not want
anyone to sit around and grieve
for her loss.
In a recent letter to her
dear friend Julie Wilmer, Casey
closed with an important lesson
in life. "Smile, smile, smile, it
makes people wonder what you
have been doing," she said.
Now is the time to "smile,
smile, smile" for Casey, to en
sure her memory may live on in
our hearts.

Contributing Writer
I was trying to do some
homework, which turned into
another exercise of futility. I
usually wouldn't have cared,
but I was going to a Mighty
Mighty Bosstones concert that
evening and I knew I was go
ing to be tired when I got back.
Overcoming my struggle with
futility, I rallied to get ready for
the show. I got on my blue suit
and my black paratrooper
boots and went with a few
other people to the show.
The Bosstones had two
opening acts which were both
interesting in their own right,
but you could tell that the ma
jority of people there came to
see the Bosstones. Throughout
the first two bands, girls kept
coming up to me and asking me
if I was in the band and if could
sign their pieces of paper. I
wasn't really in a sporting
mood, so I quickly sent them
on their way.

It didn t take me long to
realize that the only reason that

these girls came up to me was
that I had a suit on. It doesn't
take a psych major to realize
that a lot of people are now
associating suits and popular
music with the Mighty Mighty
Bosstones. They feel that only
the band wears suits and can't
understand why an audience
member would do such a thing.
In seems that there is a
large portion of the listening
public that is not "in the know."
The truth of the matter is that
suits and ska music have gone
together ever since its origins
in the streets of Kingston. If
you look hard enough you
might even find a picture of
Bob Marley wearing a suit and
lacking his characteristic dread
locks. (Just a reminder, Bob
Marley and the Wailers were a
ska outfit that recorded such
tracks as "Simmer Down" and
"Put it On.," and this all hap
pened before he became the
internationally reggae singer
we know of today.)

This is the state of the
mainstream today. Now don't

get me wrong, I am not here to
knock on "trendies" (whatever
that means anyway)— I just
want to offer my opinion. Any
way, with bands like the Mighty
Mighty Bosstones being played
regularly on radio and MTV, it
seems that the ska genre is be
coming more popular as every
day goes by.
Even on campus, at
WZBT a new ska band named
Save Ferris (catchy name huh?)
and their cover of Dexy's Mid
night Riders song "Come on
Eileen" is enormously popular.
Some people don't even know
the song is a ska song, but they
play it nonetheless, perhaps
because of the nostalgia it gen
erates.
Regardless of the DJ's
musical knowledge, it is being
played, and yes, Rudy, it is a ska
song.

But these above men
tioned bands, as well as others
such as Reel Big Fish and Dance
Hall Crashers, are really just
the tip of the iceberg. All of
the bands named are ska-core/

ska-punk more or less. This
means that they incorporate
various elements of other mu
sic, such as guitar distortion,
frequent tempo changes, and a
differing drum pattern. It is a
bastardization of the
original ska music which came
out of Jamaica in the early six
ties, which doesn't make it in
ferior, but it does make it dif
ferent.
This growing trend of ig
norance concerning ska music
and its surrounding culture has
been a topic that has interested
me for quite some time. Am I
wrong to be angered when
people tell me that they listen
to "old-school" ska music and
have never heard of the
Skatatlites? Should I just ac
cept the fact that every genre
of music, once popularized, is
going to be somewhat lost in
the mass media? To be honest
I can't really answer these ques¬

tions. I would hypothesize that
the majority of people will stop
their ska adventures with what

is on the radio or MTV. This is
not surprising, for the major
ity of music listeners tend to
stay on the surface of music,
never looking for minor bands.
I remember that during the pre
lude to the Toasters concert last
fall, people were mad at the
concert committee calling the
band "mediocre." These people
associate record sales and video
play with talent, which is a big
mistake. The Bosstones and
Save Ferris are talented bands,
but there are a host of other
"minor" ska bands that have as
much talent, if not more, than
the popular ones.
So to sum up: ska popu
lar; people ignorant of ska his
tory and culture (but that's ok);
normal facet of pop culture;
don't think talent comes with
a price tag.

If you are actually inter
ested in some "minor" ska
bands, I'll give you a few
names. Check out the Toast
ers seventh release Don't Let
the Bastards Grind You Down

Bring a little Sunrise into your life

by Justin Etheredge
Staff Writer True romance is one of
life's most elusive, hypnotic
sensations. It's what love is
before it becomes love; often,
it never has the chance to be
come anything more. And only
rarely does a movie capture
romance so honestly, that it
makes you understand the real
magic behind the word.
Before Sunrise is a charm
ing story of romance as it, in
many cases, truly exists: un
planned, unintentional, and
totally irrational. Jesse (Ethan
Hawke) is an American on the
last day of his travels through
Europe.
On the train to Vienna to

catch his flight home, he meets
beautiful Celine (Julie Delpy),
a student at the Sorbonne on
her way back to Paris. They
talk, they laugh, and immedi
ately they discover a special
chemistry.
Jesse has no money for a
hotel, and his plan was to walk
around Vienna until his morn
ing flight. With his heart in his
hand, and a sense of sweet ur
gency, he convinces Celine to
join him. They grab their bags
and leave the train.
It's mid-afternoon when
they begin wandering. Most of
the movie is dialogue, discus
sions about love, dreams, child
hoods, family, and so on. They
trade secrets and desires, share

intimacies long before they
ever touch. And as they be
come closer as friends, they
cannot deny that there is some
thing more there.
The strength of the movie
comes in the sincerity of the
delivery. The conversations are
natural and engaging, never
trite or contrived.
In one amusingly awk
ward scene, Jesse and Celine
stand inside the listening booth
in a record store. The music
playing only echoes their un
spoken feelings for each other.
In any other movie, they would
look into each other's eyes,
kiss, go somewhere and have
sex, and we could assume that
they fell in love.

But alone in that booth,
reality kicks in, and things
aren't that simple. It's like re
membering the first time we
could have, and probably
should have, kissed the girl, but
didn't, either because we were
too nervous, or we weren't sure
she felt the same way, or what
ever. Heads turned, they wet
their lips in anticipation, but it
never happens. As one looks
over, the other looks away;
unbearably drawn out, the
moment is lost.
Written and directed by
Richard Linklater (Slacker,
Dazed and Confused), the
structure of the movie mirrors
the mentality of the lovers:
without direction, without des¬

tination, finding meaning along
the way. You have to wonder
if making a movie could actu
ally be so simple, and question
howsome movies like this
could fall so far short.
In the end, Jesse and
Celine know that their time
together was not love, but nei
ther was it just a one-night af
fair. Their romance existed
completely on its own terms,
in a circumstance that has hap
pened a million times before,
but may never happen to them
again. Being together was the
only thing in the world that
mattered to them, and that is
what made their night, and the
movie, so special.



A part of you has grown in me
Together for always and never apart
Maybe in distance, but never in heart

You are the one who makes each day fun
You are the one who gives me your kind love
You seem to be the perfect friend
So I know we'll be friends to the end
For no matter what, you're always there
And no matter what, you always care

Down the tube

by Mark Berg
Contributing Writer
Some of the students in
the London Interdisciplinary
Program Abroad in England
had never been to Britain (or
even Europe) before, and their
image of London was formed
by reading novels such as
Charles Dickens_'s Pickwick
Papers.
Canterbury, population
34,500, which we visited later,
better fit their idea of an En
glish city. Bath is another good,
old-fashioned, English city.
In London, they were a)
pleasantly surprised at what
they found: a vibrant, exciting
city, and/or b) a little over
whelmed by the size and pace
of it all.

Okay, so London has
changed a bit in 100+ years.
First of all, it is big, bigger than
Gettysburg. Bigger than Adams
County, it has a population of
7 million. It takes a lot of sub
ways (the underground, or
tube), buses, and cars to move
these people around.
Most visitors to London
seem to prefer the tube. There
are 11 different lines which
cover (or, really, underlie) the
city, with many, many transfer
points.
The tube map is easy to
read (unless you're colorblind),
and you can almost always tell
where you are on the maps at
the entrances: there is a big
spot worn off where people put
their fingers to plan their jour
ney.

But there are problems
with the tube: it's hot in sum
mer and winter; it's almost al
ways crowded, even very late
at night; there are occasional
delays ("There is no service on
the Central Line west of St.
Paul's due to a person under a
train"); some dangers (an
nouncements to "Mind the
gap!" [between the car and the
platform]); but worst of all, you
can't see any of London. Your
impression of the city becomes
one of a group of disjointed
places; when you walk or ride
the bus, you get a feel for the
city as a whole.
The buses, on the other
hand, are like low-cost tour
buses, especially if you ride on

the top deck of a double-decker
bus. The front row of the top
deck is particularly exciting:
since you're at the very front
of the bus, even farther forward
than the driver, you often get
the feeling you're going o hit
the bus in front of you.
True, bus maps are not
easy to decipher, but how lost
can you get when you can al
ways get off and take the tube?
No matter what bus you take,
you're sure to see the architec
ture, the street life: the very
fabric of life in London. That
is, unless the bus gets stuck in
traffic, in which case you can
always get off and take the
tube. Which leads us to cars.
Traffic in London is horren
dous, and cars are a significant
danger for the unwary pedes
trian—actually, for any pedes
trian.

Of course you know that
they drive on the "wrong" side
of the road, so you really have
to think about which way to
look before crossing a street.
Fortunately, at most major in
tersections, "Look Right" or
"Look Left" is painted in large
letters on the street a foot or
so from the curb.
The real danger is not
actually the cars; it's the driv
ers. First of all, they drive very
(I think) fast for the city when
they're not stuck in traffic, even
though the speed limit is 30
mph. Worse yet, they seem to
hate pedestrians. You can al
most see the hate in their eyes
as they bear down upon you
whenever they think you have
encroached on their territory.
Maybe this is because they pay
$4.00 per gallon of petrol.

My suggestion is, either
take the bus (let the bus driver
scare the pedestrians), or,
whenever possible, walk from
place to place. Just be sure to
carry your London: A to Z map
book, because even the locals
don't know where even nearby
streets are.
Just be sure to watch out
for those cars.

Red Comer one to be avoided

by Jon Froehlich
Staff Writer "I know what I did and
did not do." - Jack Moore
It is difficult to pick out
and name the most disappoint
ing thing about Red Corner. It
wasn't the questionable acting,
or the fragmented storyline, or
the glaring ethnocentric
themes. No, it wasn't any of
these. The biggest letdown of
this latest movie from director
Jon Avnet (The Mighty Ducks,
Fried Green Tomatoes) was

that it could ve been so much
more if those who made this
movie had taken more time
to think it through and work
out the many kinks that make
it seem so minor league.
As corporate attor
ney Jack Moore, Richard
Gere (Internal Affairs, Pretty
Woman) delivers yet another
border-line performance play
ing the only type of role that
he seems even remotely capable
of: a high class, smooth talk
ing big-shot who always thinks
he's in control.

The plot of Red Cor
ner consists of a few discon
nected events that seem to
serve only the purpose of mak
ing China look bad. Moore,
in China to see to the closing
of a television deal, has a one
night stand with a fashion
model and wakes up the next
morning only to find her dead
and himself the main suspect.
As Moore is slapped
around and threatened with
execution, Red Corner, in the

tradition of movies like Mid
night Express, plays on our
fears of foreign, and what we
might consider barbaric, pun
ishment. While it has yet to be
seen if this movie will be criti
cized for the expressly negative
impression that it gives of
China as a nation, Red Corner
reeks of an ethnocentric atti
tude. Though one of minor char-

m umbles "™
something about how, if the
situations were reversed, the
United States wouldn't want
China muscling in, China's side
is left mostly untold.
Not only is Red Cor
ner socially questionable, but
the fact remains that it is sim
ply not a very good movie. It
lacks direction and focus and,
as a result, has many other ba
sic problems.
The language barrier, for
one, is a major problem with
this movie. Though undeniably
realistic, all the translations and
subtitles make Red Corner seem
fragmented and, as a result,
hard to follow. Even though
the language difference would
be one of the major problems

if one were actually in this situ
ation, it doesn't seem that hav
ing more people speaking flu
ent English would have dam
aged the already debatable in
tegrity of this movie.
With the situation as is,
the plot is hard to follow and
sometimes mentally draining to
comprehend - let alone enjoy.
Though there are somescenes
that are entertaining, these are,
as the expression goes, few and
far between.
We also get to see in
Red Corner the predictable
semi-romantic relationship
between male client and fe
male attorney. Yuelin, played
by Bai Ling (Nixon, The
Crow), comes in as Moore's
faithful lawyer. Though she
does a far superior acting job
than Gere, Ling's role is
equally unrealistic.

As Moore, though not a
criminal lawyer, attempts to
defend himself, Yuelin (for
some reason) forgoes all tradi
tional Chinese law and strikes
out of the well-trodden path to
find the truth. In this we see
the usual courtroom story
where a brilliant, young, attrac
tive lawyer picks apart a huge
conspiracy and triumphantly
saves the innocent defendant
from certain death.
Even taking into con
sideration the few decent scenes
and the delicate topic that this
movie contained, it is an un
avoidable conclusion that Red
Corner is a movie one can prob
ably miss without regret.

Students return to
preschool

From staff reports
Some Gettysburg College
students are going back to pre
school.
Each year the College's
psychology department sends
more than 100 students into the
local community to work in
nearly 10 different early child
hood programs. And while the
daycare centers, preschools, and
elementary schools provide the
college students with an oppor
tunity to study child develop
ment, the students also provide
the community with a valuable

.
Students are giving back to
the community through this pro
gram, according to Marcia
Brilhante, director and owner of
Child's Garden Child Care, a
center located on Mummasburg
Road, just outside of Gettysburg.
"The students help a lot more
than by just putting in time," she
said. "The children are exposed
to a variety of people and expe
riences, and that really makes a
difference in their behavior. And
the students lend a helping hand
that allows the staff to do other
things."

"Teachers tell us that the
students are quite helpful in their
classrooms, especially because
they can give the children move
individual attention than might
otherwise be possible," said
Kathy Cain, an associate profes
sor of psychology. "For our part,
we are very grateful to the teach
ers, parents, and children for giv
ing the students this wonderful
opportunity."
Psychology department
faculty members have required
students to volunteer in local
programs since 1990, according
to Martha Arterberry, associate
professor of psychology. While
they are in the classrooms, many
Gettysburg College students
merely observe the children.
More advanced students per
form "studies"—structured

games that require one-on-one
interaction with children and
allow the students to assess
things like the child's memory or
understanding of appearance
reality (the difference between
how something looks and what

it really is).
"Students learn about
children's abilities, and they
learn how to assess children as
a developmental psychologist
would," Arterberry said.
Arterberry has also ob
served that many students do
better in their college classes
after they've worked in the
community, because they can
relate textbook and lecture in
formation to their observa
tions. "It's one thing to read
about something in a book and
another to actually see it,"
Arterberry said.
There are a few "rules"
to the program, including par
ents permission for a child to
participate, according to Cain.
Research conducted by the col
lege students typically involves
asking general questions rather
than finding individual infor
mation they learn about a par
ticular child in their classroom

is strictly confidential. And the
child has the option of stopping
the session at any time if he or
she in uncomfortable.
Most children, however,
enjoy working with the college
students, Cain said. In fact,
they find questions asked dur
ing student research entertain
ing and fun. Gettysburg Col
lege students also seem to find
their work with young children
particularly rewarding, and
many go on to pursue careers
that involved working with
youngsters, according Cam and
Arterberry.
"Many of our students
are interested in careers with
children before taking these
classes, but more than a few of
the others have changed their
career plans after their day
care/preschool volunteer expe
rience in order to pursue jobs
that will enable them to work
with children," Cain said.

"This day-care center is
offering me a very fun and lov
ing experience," said Suzanna
Nam, a sophomore who is
working at Child's Garden. "I
hope that I can do something
associated with children after
graduation, even if it is just a
side job."

In Case You Missed It
Polanski scores in
Chinatown

by Glen Beck
Staff Writer

intense (would we expect any
thing less of Nicholson?).
Compelling in such movies as
The Shining and One Flew
Over the Cuckoo's Nest,
Nicholson doesn't let us down
here. Jack steals the scene even
when he doesn't say anything.
For example the scene between
Mulwray (an informant) and
Gittes, neither actor says a
word but the dramatic tension
can be cut by a knife (just like
Gitte's nose).
Dunaway, who has ap
peared in such classics as
Bonnie and Clyde, through her
presence and intensity, relays
the fragility and desperation of
her character in every scene.
She is a trooper and, from what
I can tell, a method actress.
The filmmaking overall is
suberb. The director knew
how to manipulate the camera
to make the shots heighten the
action and the tension. The

"Forget it, Jake. It's
Chinatown." Well, don't for
get—actually go rent it.
Chinatown, directed by Roman
Polanski is one of the classics
of the cinema; a must see. In
addition to the multi-Academy
Award Nominations (Best Ac
tor, Best Actress, Best Film, Best
Director) and the multi-Golden
Globe nominations including
two wins (one for Jack
Nicholson, one for Roman
Polanski), the film is one of the
best acted movies ever made.
The story follows Jack
Nicholson, as J.J. Gittes, a pri
vate eye who makes money off
husbands who suspect their
wife is cheating on them, and
vice versa.
He insists it's an honest
living and enjoys all the pub
licity he receives, until a
woman pretending to be the
wife of the head of the water
company uses him to frame the
poor guy.

Faye Dunaway, as the real
wife, is mad as hell and threat
ens to sue Gittes. But he's just
as mad as she is that his repu
tation as photographer of
infedity could be tarnished like
this, and offers to help get to
the bottom of it.
The plot turns out to be
one of those kooky real estate
schemes, involving L.A.'s per
petual water shortage and a
bunch of orange groves the
water is secretly being rerouted
to. All in all, it's going to gross
the bad guys about $30 million.
Complicating matters
somewhat, Dunaway's husband
turns up dead after about the
first 30 minutes (drowned, of
course) and no one knows who
perpetrated his death.

Could it be Dunaway her
self, the femme fatale? Or
Dunaway's shady father (John
Huston)? Well I ain't going to
tell ya! (See the Internet Movie
Data base for further informa
tion). Nicholson is great play
ing, once again, an offbeat,
unglamorous role that subverts
conventional morality. He|

medium and close up shots
emphasize key facial expres
sions. It's obvious why Polanski
is considered the master of the
film-noir.

Go check out the film. . .
heck, if the Simpsons would
mock it ("Forget it Marge. It's
Chinatown.), you know it must
be good.

Curtain Call

by Glen Beck
Staff Writer

"In December 1962,
three members of Owl and
Nightingale accepted the chal
lenge of advisor and director,
Prof. Emile O. Schmidt, to
direct a group of scenes for
the _^ experience and joy of it.'
Scenes were chosen be the stu
dents from The Importance of
Being Ernest, The Glass Me
nagerie, and something which
bore the unlikely title of Big
Fish, Little Fish... One of
tonight's plays will serve as
the fiftieth offering under that
aegis. Fifty plays in five years.
Not bad!" - The Prompter,
December, 1967
Each November, stu
dents in the theater
department's directing class
present a series of one-act
plays varying in styles, set
tings, and playwrights.

Students from all over
campus audition, are cast, and
then work in collaboration
with the student director for
about a month's time to pro
duce a polished production.
Last year's festival of
one-acts set an all-time
record: 19 directors (from the
Fundamentals of Directing
Class) and 13 productions.
These included
Edmond, The Bear, Another
Way Out, For Whom the
Southern Belle Tolls, The
Danube, Life in Excellence
and a few others.
This year, 11 of those 19
directors moved on to Ad
vanced Directing, and are in
the process of producing 11
one-act productions.
The lab festival this year
has productions that are even
more wide-ranging in style,
staging, and choice of play
wright. Like last year, the
number of students involved
exceeds 50.

Shows include Kissing
Cousins, The Author's Voice,
The Maker of Dreams, Cham
ber Music, Snowangel, A
Slight Ache, Hello Out There,
20 Years From Now, The Mad
house, Hot -N- Throbbing,
and For All the Saints.

It happened so suddenly on a Saturday night,
She left us to ponder,
Why would she would leave without even saying why
or goodbye,
I never knew her well but it did not matter,
Because I knew she cared for people of all kinds.
Her smile was infectious, her camera her eye on the
world.
I will miss you, Casey Dunn, and although I retire,
Your caring soul will be therefor all of us to hold.

Conflict and Consensus
To the Editor:
the sheer fact

Put the college's best foot forward

Last year Gettysburg Col
lege was evaluated by The
Princeton Review, and I be
lieved the review poorly por
trayed our campus community.
The Princeton Review has no
standard with which it judges
a school; instead, it relies upon
opinions of students who sub
mit pertinent information.
When I first read the re
view I agreed with many of the
statements, and wrote a letter
to the editor attacking the
administration's poor handling
of the college's problems. Af
ter that, I did some research
and realized that random stu
dents had beend chosen, not a
fair sample of our student
population, and that there was
no standard with which to
cross-examine any submitted
information. As a result,
schools similar to Gettysburg,
like Dickson, and Franklin and
Marshall, all received similar
write-ups.
This seemed ridiculous to

me. Gettysburg, like so many
other schools, does have seri
ous problems with diversity,
homophobia, alchohol abuse,
rape, and other social issues.
But I do not believe that this
school is a horrible place to be.
We have the Center for
Public Service, the Women's
Center, the Intercultural Re
source Center, excellent aca
demic departments, and the
Residential College Program;
all these things make Gettys
burg a vibrant, challenging, and
wonderful place to be. I be
lieve that many students, like
myself, have become bitter and
upset with all the problems
which have gone unchecked
around us. As a result we have
expressed our bitterness in
writing, chastising our school.
I submit that we have
done nothing to help our col
lege beyond raising issues for
examination. The types of
people that are needed to
change the wrongs that plague

Gettysburg -- _intelligent
people, socially concerned
people, those that are willing
to change and challenge policy
— have been frightened off by
our horrible descriptions of
Gettysburg. This will do noth
ing to solve the problems our
bitterness has raised.
If you want to fix this
school, put your best foot for
ward. Invite in those that can
change and correct what de
stroys our community, and
show what makes our school
great as well as bad. Gettys
burg has been given the chance
to be re-evaluated by The
Princeton Review, and this time
let'sencourage those that can
help Gettysburg to enroll, not
frighten them away with bitter
ness and resentment.
Respectfully,

Charles Dittrich

A Note of Thanks:
The Staff of The Gettysburgian would
like to sincerely thank Akbar Rizvi,
Chesha Miller, Henry Fawell, Laura
Rooty Justin Etheridge, Scott Buhrman,
and everyone else who went above and
beyond to help with this issue in our
time of need. Without your support and
assistance, this issue might not have
been completed.

Consider this

This past weekend, a great
tragedy occurred within our
community. One of our own
took her life.
Whether or not you had
a close personal relationship
with the student, nearly every
one is affected by this tragedy.
As it seems with all adver
sity which a community must
face, there are lessons to be
learned, and as hard as it may
be to think about right now,
there are lessons here too.
Often , when tragedy
befalls us, there is an emotional
response of panic, confusion,
anger, and sadness.
Yet in spite of these emo
tions, there are always those
who are there for us in our time
of need—there to lend a hug, or
a shoulder to cry on, or perhaps
just a kindly smile or a caring
ear. All too often, college, like
life, becomes a fragmented ex
istence, one in which competi
tion is rampant, self interest is
predominant, and where caring
seems to be an emotion left for
only those closest to us.

This weekend, humanity
in its purest form was displayed
through a community coming
together in support of all its
members.
As a whole, the campus
community, from students to se
curity, faculty to counseling ser
vices, and chapel to college life,
all came together as a cohesive
unit. While the feelings of pain

will not fade quickly,
that someone is there to care, to
share the burden of grief, aids our
collective healing.
To the entire campus com
munity, all of those who took the
time to offer their support in any
way, a sincere and heartfelt thank
you. While we cannot change
what has already been done, we
can take measures to help try and
prevent something like this from
happening again.
Within the boundaries of
our community, there are a great
many individuals who genuinely
care, as evidenced by the wide
spread support over this past
weekend's events. How do we
find them on a regular basis?
To everyone at Gettysburg
College: reach out to someone.
Don't allow yourself to become
isolated, show someone you care.
We all have times when we
know we could have reached out
and didn't. Yet, if we all could take
that chance just once, to just go
and show someone you care un
conditionally, perhaps life would
be a little easier for all of us.

Believe in your own human
ity, take a chance on caring, only
good can come of it.
On a personal note, Casey,
you were one of us here at The
Gettysburgian. You served us as a
columnist, worked with us as a
colleague, brought us candy
Wednesday nights, but most im
portantly, you were a friend. We
will miss you in our lives and our
hearts always.

From the Donkey's Mouth

United States and China, a long road ahead

By Kelly Davis
We have all heard about
the arrival of China's Presi
dent, Jiang Zemin, to the
United States. For the past
week, you could not have
picked up a newspaper or
watched television without see
ing a nice photo-op of Presi
dent Clinton and Jiang waving
and smiling. This trip was ob
viously a big step in relations
between China and the United
States. It was the first visit to
Washington that the Chinese
president has made since the
massacre of pro-democracy
demonstrators in Beijing in
1989. It appears that this trip
was little more than a public
relations trip for China's presi
dent.

Scenes like Jiang ringing
the opening bell at the New

York Stock Exchange and visit
ing Independence Hall, show
the irony that exists within the
visit of the Chinas President.
China is by no stretch of the
imagination a democratic
country and for Jiang to visit
the birth place of democracy in
America is laughable. China
has an atrocious human rights
record and makes no excuses
for it. China is a place of reli
gious persecution, forced abor
tions, and political oppression.
When Mr. Jiang visited
the New York City he was boy
cotted by the mayor and the
governor of New York, but he
was greeted with open arms by
the business community. I
think these actions are symbolic
of US-Chinese relations. We
have become focused on the
economics of the situation.

China offers a huge market for
American businesses. It is dif
ficult for many industries not
to tap into this market regard
less of the state of human rights
in China.
Since Jiang began his
nine-day visit to the United
States in Hawaii, he has been
hounded by demonstrators
protesting China's human
rights record and its treatment
of Taiwan and Tibet. At each
stop on his trip to America, Mr.
Jiang was greeted with protests
from people appalled by the ac
tions of the Chinese govern
ment. Demonstrations were
held everywhere that the presi
dent went. From DC to
Harvard to Los Angeles, there
were protests led by US citi
zens, Chinese students, Chinese
scholars, and former political

prisoners. This was a great
opportvinity for these people to
express there dissent with the
Chinese government's prac
tices. It was a chance to voice
this to not only the Chinese but
to the US government. At this
point we have to wonder if this
voice was truly heard by either
party. When questioned about
the protests, Jiang told report
ers sometimes noises came into
my ears, but said the demon
strations would not affect
China's policies. What will
make the Chinese government
reform their policies? This
seems to be the million dollar
question that the US does not
seem to be to interested in an
swering. Although Jiang was
met with harsh criticism about
human rights issues from both

sides of the political spectrum
there was still no strong state
ment of condemnation or de
nunciation given.
Throughout his trip,
Jiang was evasive about answer
ing the questions about the
controversial issues that sur
round China. Rep. Nancy
Pelosi, a California Democrat
and leading critic of China, said
later, The questions were frank
but he wasn't frank in respond
ing. He was evasive but engag
ing. In other words, he re
sponded but he did not an
swer". These evasive tactics
seemed to be acceptable to the
politicians. It was as if the poli
ticians were making the obliga
tory censure of the Chinese
government but did not expect

Howard Public Relations Chairs - Panhel
and IFC This week the Gettysburg
College community was
shocked by the loss of Casey
Dunn. She will be in the
thoughts and prayers of the
Greek students here at Gettys
burg. Casey was an Alpha Xi
Delta sister and was very active
on campus. To say that she will
be sorely missed is an under
statement. Our deepest condo
lences go out to all of Casey's
friends and family.
All First Year students in
terested in rushing a fraternity
or sorority next semester need

to register for rush. Registra
tion will be held on Tuesday,
November 11 at 8:00pm in the
CUB Ballroom. Registration
costs $5.00 so dont forget to
bring your wallet, it'll be the
best five bucks you will spend
all year. In addition to regis
tering for rush, there is an
added bonus of hearing Matt
Supple speak on the benefits of
joining a Greek organization.
From what we hear, he is an
excellent speaker with a lot of
great things to say, so don't miss
it! This Friday, Delta
Gamma will hold their annual
Anchor Splash at 7:00 at the
pool which is located in the
CUB. All proceeds from this

fundraiser will benefit Aides for
the Blind. Come out and sup
port this worthy cause.
Many thanks are in order
to Kristen Hess. Due to unfor
tunate circumstances, Kristen
has had to resign from her po
sition as Panhellenic Council
President. Over the past year,
Kristen has had a profound
impact on Greek life here at
Gettysburg. All our thanks and
appreciation go out to Kristen
on a job very well done! Abby
Rodgers will take over for the
remainder of the semester.
First Year guys, that rush
booklet that we've been prom
ising you will finally arrive in
your mailboxes by this Friday,
so keep a look out for it. Once

again, it will contain informa
tion concerning each fraternity
on rampus. It will be a great
guide to help you out through
rush. Next Monday, November
10, Dave Westol - the Execu
tive Director of Theta Chi - will
be speaking in the Chapel at
9:00pm. He will be speaking
about the advantages of being
Greek, and is Nationally
known for his speeches. In
fact, he is arguably the best
there is about promoting a
Greek system on a college cam
pus. This is a meeting that has
been made mandatory for all
Greek men, and is highly rec
ommended for everyone else
on campus.

Gettysburg - get ready to
rock! On November 8, the first
ever all campus wide party will
be held directly behind Alpha
Tau Omega. If you don't know
where that is, get a map, or ask
a friend because it should'nt be
missed. There will be bands
playing and people every
where, so be sure not to be left
out. We want to make it clear
that this event is not limited to
certain people on campus -
EVERYONE is on the guest list!
There will be no negging at the
door, or walks around the
block. Everyone gets in, and
everyone parties for free. This
is not a BYOB event, in fact
there will be no alcoholic bev
erages within the party area so
don't bring any.

Conflict and Consensus
The Pachyderm's Pulpit

Elephant's on parade

by John Dunlap
The headlines seem to tell
the story, once again a GOP
sweep. In 1993, the Republi
can Party captured the Gover
norships of the State of New
Jersey and the Commonwealth
of Virginia, as well as taking the
mayor's office in the nations
largest city, New York. That
was a precursor for the Repub
lican tidal wave that rocked the
nation in 1994 when the Re
publican Party captured Con
gress for the first time in 40
years, while winning a major
ity of governor's races across
the country. Now as Demo
crats hope to retake Congress
in 1998, Republican victories
in election '97 must now dash
their hopes.

This week the Republican
Party was not only able to
maintain their hold on various
seats but also strengthen their
position. For the first time in
history the Governor, Lieuten
ant Governor, and the Attorney
General of Virginia will all be
republican, a first not only for
Virginia but for the entire
south. Republicans seem now
to have clinched their southern
base. With their hold on the
south, republicans had to con
centrate on the northeast
where President Clinton took
the entire region last year. This
past Tuesday, republican candi
dates were reelected because

they kept their promises.
Mayor Rudolph Guiliani was
the choice for the Big Apple
once again. In 1993, the
former prosecutor promised to
bring down crime and he did
just that. Crime has fallen by
half in New York City as Mayor
Guiliani used basic republican
principles in getting tough on
crime. He showed leadership
and in a city that has a 5 to 1
democrat edge, Mayor Rudy
defeated his democratic oppo
nent, Ruth Messinger 57% to

41%. In the race to fill Susan
Molinari's seat in Congress, re
publican Vito Fossella, crushed
the democrat, Eric Vitaliano
who early on had the lead in
the polls. The 32 year-old
Fossella took 62% of the vote
against the democrat New York
assemblyman Vitaliano. Once
again, democrats tried to attack
the Speaker of the House,
Newt Gingrich, but it failed just
as it did last year. The agenda
that Democrats have labeled

the Gingrich agenda is popu
lar; people want less govern
ment and fewer taxes. Repub
licans promised that and deliv
ered. The Speaker's personal
popularity may not be high but
his ideas and vision are winning
the day.
In the closest race of the
night in New Jersey, the people
of the Garden State gave Gov¬

ernor Christine Todd
Whitman four more years.
Governor Whitman narrowly
defeated her democrat oppo
nent, State Senator Jim
McGreevey, 47% to 46% but
the close race not only came
from Mr. McGreevey who
ran a great campaign but
from the right. The closeness
of the Whitman race shows
that while Republicans
should and must reach out
beyond their base they can
not forget those who put
them where they are, the con
servative religious element of

the party. A total of 7% of
the voters in New Jersey sup
ported two pro-life third
party candidates. Conserva
tives groups refused to sup
port the Governor and in the
last days of the campaign she
had to bring conservatives
home. Last year republican
candidates who lost were
those who forgot the base
and lost their most solid sup
porters. If you put
Whitman's 47% with the 7%
pro-life vote than even in
Democratic New Jersey con
servative ideas are doing well
on the local level.

When one looks at the
campaigns of the candidates
it is clearly visible that the
GOP message is still carrying
the day. It won in 1993,
1994, and even 1996 when

President Clinton joined the bud
get balancing, tax-cutting, wel
fare reforming bandwagon.
Taxes were the big issue this week
and the anti-tax feeling that has
existed since the Boston tea party
is still alive and well. Tax cuts
work, they grow the economy
and increase revenues into the
government. Virginia's Repub
lican Nominee for Governor, Jim
Gilmore promised to eliminate
the personal property tax on cars
and trucks in his campaign and
the voters rallied to his side.
When Mr. Gilmore began his
campaign he was behind his
Democrat opponent, Lieutenant
Governor Don Beyer but he set
the campaign's agenda and Mr.
Beyer's scare tactics of saying that
Gilmore would cut education
failed. Democrats try to scare the
people into electing them, what
they need is a positive message
or they will be out of power in
the states and in the Congress for
a long time.

For those who say that
Governor-elect Gilmore will not
be able to cut taxes, they need
only to go up the road where
Christie Whitman ran on a
pledge to cut personal income
taxes by 30% in three years. She
did it in two years and the rate
of growth in property taxes has
increased at a lower rate than
they did under the man she de
feated four years ago, Governor
Jim Florio, who gave the state its

largest tax increase in history.
What makes election '97
even more interesting is that
President Clinton campaigned
in every major race for the
democrats and everywhere he
went democrats lost. Today
campaign fund-raising scandals
have bankrupted the Demo
cratic Party. Democrats are in
debt and were unable to com
pete with the Republican's le
gal raising and spending of
money. The party is bereft of
ideas and that showed when

the former Virginia Democratic
Party chairman, Paul Goldman
upon seeing the democratic
rout in told the Washington
Post, "The high command of
the Democratic Party, has cre
ated a party that doesn't debate
the issues, that is devoid of in
tellectual content." Republi
cans should not be afraid of
their agenda; the GOP does not
have to cater to the liberal spe
cial interest groups, when Re
publicans cave they lose. Presi
dent Bush when he raised taxes
is evidence of that.

Through Election '97 re
publicans have their playbook
for 1998, cut taxes, fight crime,
keep your promises, and unite
the party. That is the recipe not
only to hold on to Congress but
also to increase the republican
majority in both of house of the
Congress as well as in the
states.

Donkey

anything to come from it.
Why is the American
government only paying lip
service to the subject of hu
man rights violations? Unfor
tunately it seems that the dol
lar has become more impor
tant than our moral integrity
as a country. Cuba has been

guilty of extremely similar hu
man rights violations and the
United States has taken a strong
stand in opposition. We have
refused to support the oppres
sive regime there. Why the
contradiction? Policy toward
China has been largely shaped
by a US business lobby eager to

continued from page 12
tap that enormous market.
If we as a nation have
become unable to stand up
for our beliefs, then we have
lost a great deal of strength
as a nation. If we, as the sole
remaining world-power, are
unable to stand up for what
we believe in then who will?

Jiang has stated that It is natu
ral for our two countries to hold
different views on some issues.
The concepts on democracy, hu
man rights and freedoms are rela
tive and specific ones," he said.
Human rights are not a relative
issue. There are certain rights
that every human being is en¬

titled to regardless of citizen
ship. The United States needs
to be more active and asser
tive in its actions to improve
human rights conditions both
domestically and globally. As
part of that, it is necessary to
stand up to and pressure ob
vious human rights violators

oventral Axis Formation in Fish
Embryos " Dr Fluck has done
extensive research on the mecha
nisms establishing the vertebrate
body. Using medaka fish embryos as
a model system, he has focused
primarily on the dorsoventral (back to
front), and found that gravity influ
ences both the organization of
microtubules at the vegetal pole, and
the position of the dorsoventral axis
in medaka embryos. Dr Fluck will
describe his experiments involving
the tilting and centrifugation of
embryos, and the use of indirect (and
direct) immunofluorescence to
visualize microtubules. The College
Community is invited to attend, light
refreshments will be served.
