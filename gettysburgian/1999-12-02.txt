America's 8th most wired campus

unplugged

fuse was only one of many problems.
The second meeting, held at 4:00
p.m., saw the group believing that the
electricity would soon be restored. The
third, said Eighmy, was held around
5:30, and between 5 and 5:30, the first
phase was being fixed. Things looked
positive.
This did not last, however, because
of another problem which arose during
the day. When the phase was recon-

On Monday, November 29, elec
tricity all over campus went out. The
initial problem began when a fuse on
one of the three main phases, blew
around 12:30 p.m.
The campus is supplied with
13,000 volts from the GPU, or Gen
eral Public Utility Company. On cam
pus, there are three main phases that
are hooked up to several other phases
for buildings and even these are split
up. This is the rea¬

son why only parts
of residence halls
and buildings had
slight and some did
not after the initial
problem.
"Oh no,
we've hit some
thing with the con
struction," was the
first thought that
ran through the
mind of Larry
Eighmy, Director of
Facilities Planning
and Management.
This was also
a thought of some
students. "Since I
was having class
right beside the
construction, I
thought that was
the problem, but I
soon learned it was

something more,"
said Jay Gallagher, a first year student.
After the first fuse blew, the staff
working on the problem was faced with
a decision: Should we turn off the other
two phases? The answer was affirma
tive, so around two o'clock, the rest of
campus was shut down.
According to Eighmy, the reason
for the outage wasn't stress on the sys
tem (a short), but rather the age of some
of the equipment. Throughout the day,
several meetings were held with several
College administrators, Facilities Ser
vices, and GPU. The first one was held
to discuss the three possible scenarios
of the problem. Eighmy described these
to the group. They were: that the parts
needed could be found locally, second,
that they needed to go to York for the
parts, and third, that the out-of-service

nected, a lightening arrestor (a large
surge protector)went out, causing a surge
to disable a second phase. Smoke and a
loud noise were heard by the staff as this
occurred at the College. This surge even
knocked out some of the equipment at
the GPU substation in Biglerville, which
then necessitated the GPU workers to go
there and fix that problem.
Though the GPU employees were
in Biglerville, the College's own staif,
worked diligently to find out the source
of the troubles with our system. There
fore, a high voltage expert was brought
in to confirm that the lightening arres
tor was down. He did and it was the
consensus that there would be no power
on for the night.
Around 8:30 p.m., however, elec
tricity was reconnected on a smaller scale
to some of the halls and buildings on

campus, after the Biglerville substation
was fixed of its own problems.
Although the lights and electricity
are back on, several minor problems still
remain. Eighmy pointed out that many
clocks, including Glatfelter clock, mis
cellaneous motors and breakers also
needed attention.
He noted that the preparedness
for the Y2K problem saved the college
from a complete shutdown. In the Cen
ter Energy Plant, a back-up generator
that was going to be hooked up this
Monday was used to keep the boilers
on-line. The generators that will be used
x _. _.i-Hmmmtm-;:
,. — for the new science

building also came
in handy; the Din
ing Center and
Penn Hall had elec
tricity. Fifteen hun
dred blankets and
pillows that are
used for summer
conferences were
put in the Dining
Center and Resi
dent Assistants
were given several
flashlights. Adams
County and Bor
ough Emergency
Management
Teams, as well as
the Borough Police,
were notified of the
problem.

Even after the
minor problems are fixed, the college
will shutdown the power to fix some
other problems. They will replace
Gettysburg and GPU's redundancy, do
electrical work for the new science
building, and perform the annual pre
ventive maintenance on the equipment.
"I thought the use of voice mail
was effective and kept students in
formed. Although it was annoying at
first, I was actually disappointed when
the power came on," said first year stu
dent Meredith Bartron.
"I was very pleased how everyone
worked as a team. We had good com
munication channels, good Y2K pre
paredness, the voice mail system that
was extremely useful and I feel we are
an ultimately stronger institution be
cause of this," said Eighmy.

Sri Lanka
Civilians were killed
when the church they were
taking refuge in was shelled.
Although it is not clear if the
shelling was intentional, pre
vious skirmishes between the
military and the Liberation Ti
gers of Tamil Eelam have tar
geted civilians.

Nigeria
The oil-rich Niger delta
is currently under military
control after Nigerian troops
were sent in late last month.
They are responding to the
murder of several police offic
ers, but Human Rights Watch
is afraid the army will take
indiscriminate revenge. Al
though the area has been
closed off, there are indica
tions that the military has
killed civilians and burned
homes. Many residents have
fled. The region remains poor,
despite the billions of dollars
the oil has generated for the
country.

Chechnya
Russia continues its of
fensive in Chechnya. Reports
say Russian troops have started
looting the area. Meanwhile,
thousands of Chechens have
fled to neighboring Ingushetia.
On Tuesday, rebel fighters at
tacked civilians trying to pro
tect their village, which had al
ready seen considerable dam
age from the Russian army.

Kuwait
The Kuwaiti paliament
showed its lack of respect for
fundamental rights by reject
ing a law that would allow
women to vote or hold office.
Women are not the only
group that could complain;
currently only 10 percent of
the population is allowed to
vote.

World: WTO
Seattle has become the
focus of much attention re
cently as the World Trade Or
ganizations meeting gets un
derway. "Human rights
should come first," Amnesty
says, noting the lack ol seri
ous consideration of that
topic on the conference's
agenda. International treaties
(such as the International
Covenant on Civil and Politi
cal Rights, the International
Covenant on Economic, So
cial and Cultural Rights and
the Conventions of the Inter
national Labour Organiza
tion) must take precedence
over the interest of multina
tional corporations.

years, universities across the

that all that work may not pay

The report, based on a

they declared that institutions

Want to score big bucks? Try
becoming the president of a
college or university.
According to a new sal
ary survey released by The
Chronicle of Higher Educa
tion, presidents of private col
leges are making more money
than they did when the publi
cation first started tracking
their annual earnings in 1991.
The Chronicle reported
that the median for total pay
and benefits for college presi-

than $500,000 in pay and ben
efits. About 13 percent of the
475 surveyed earned more than
$300,000.
Several factors figure into
the salary increases, but chief
among them is competition
with the private sector. Also
cited is the high level of stress
that goes along with the job.
Despite the growing pres
sures, the Chronicle reported
that many critics of the rapidly
inflating salaries worry that
colleges and universities are
behaving more like businesses,
rather than not-for-profit insti
tutions committed to serving.

here's
m y
take on
three
of the
hottest

new re
leases in theaters and video stores.
Thursday afternoon, while wait
ing for the turkey to cook, my family
sat down to watch Notting Hill, the
romantic comedy starring Julia Roberts
and Hugh Grant. My sister and I had
both caught the movie before, but no
body else had.
The movie centers around the re
lationship between movie superstar
Anna Scott (Roberts) and travel
bookshop owner William Thacker
(Grant). After meeting accidentally a
few times in the fun London section
called Notting Hill, the pair tries to see
if love can really happen between the
famous and the not-so-famous.
Laughs abound as William intro
duces Anna to his friends and very bi
zarre Welsh roommate. The funniest
moments of the film come when Will
iam heads to Anna's hotel to see her,
only to be mistaken as a reporter doing
a story on her latest movie. Watching
him try to deal with the situation is truly
hilarious.

The movie also explores the prob
lems of being famous, as Anna cannot
go anywhere without a photographer
being there. William finds himself con
stantly faced with pictures of Anna, not

allowing him to forget her.
This romantic comedy is one of
the best I've seen in a long time. Grant
plays a typical Hugh Grant character—
a slightly confused bloke who manages
to be both vulnerable and very attrac
tive. When the movie came out, all the
papers said that Roberts was playing
Julia Roberts. She does a wonderful job
in the film, managing to gain the
audience's sympathy, showing another
side of fame that most people don't

think of. I f
you hate Hugh
Grant
and
Julia
Rob
erts,
you
should see this
movie f o r
Roger

one scene, beautifully directed by
Michell. Instead of simply saying that
a year has passed, the passage of time is
shown by having William walk down a
street in Notting Hill. The changes

around him, together
with the song play
ing, make for a won
derful moment of
film. So if you're
looking for a roman
tic comedy that isn't
too horribly senti
mental, go out and
rent Notting Hill. I
highly recommend it.
Besides, it mentions
Bayswater!
Friday night
found my entire fam
ily heading to the
theater and seeing

the latest installment in the James Bond
series, The World is Not Enough. Pierce
Brosnan makes his third appearance as
Bond, and a wonderful Bond he is.
The plot of this Bond movie in
volves James acting as a bodyguard to
Elektra King (Sophie Marceau), the
daughter of an oil tycoon. There's natu¬

rally a lot more involved than that, in
volving c mspiracy and Elektra's former
captor Renard (Robert Carlyle), but it's
film. Does the plot really mat
much? lames does have another

a Bond
ter that
Bond
girl in
t h e
movie,
anuclear
scien
t 1 s t
named
Christ
m a s
Jones who really
serves n o

pur
pose other than the necessity of having
two Bond girls.
The World is Not Enough is enter
tainment, pure and simple. I can't re
ally give it too many kudos for plot, as
it's somewhat convoluted and, to be
blunt, pretty weak. Another main prob
lem with this movie is that the villains
are very much underused. There is no
real archenemy, and the really villain—
the one in charge—is pretty much for
the viewer to determine.

of life; like any good action flick, they
entertain. This latest addition to the
Bond film library may not be the best
two hours I've ever spent in a movie
theater, but it's a movie worth watch
ing to escape from the world for a while.
And speaking of needing to es
cape, by the time Saturday night rolled

However, it does
have a number of strong
elements as well. I was
quite happy to see that M
(Judi Dench) played a
larger role in this movie
than in past ones. Instead
of staying back at head
quarters, she actually gets
to travel and becomes in
volved in the action of the
story. And two words:
Pierce Brosnan. Need I
really say more?
Bond movies are
never going to make you
contemplate the meaning

around, I was definitely looking for one.
So my sister, her boyfriend and I all
headed out to the theater and caught
Sleepy Hollow. Though I wanted to see
the movie, I had some reservations, be
^^^^^^^^^ ing fa-

short
story.
How
ever, I
tried
to put
aside
m y
c o n -

op
tions of the story (mainly revolving
around that old cartoon) and sat down
to try and enjoy the film.
And enjoy it I did. Johnny Depp
plays Ichabod Crane, an advanced
thinking New York City constable sent
to the small town of Sleepy Hollow
upstate in 1799 to investigate a series
of beheadings. He arrives with a kiss
from young Katrina Van Tassel (Chris
tina Ricci) and settles in to explore the
goings on of the town.
A scientific-minded man, Crane is
faced with the entire town's belief that
the murders are being committed by a
headless horseman, the spirit of a Ger
man Hessian killed during the Ameri
can Revolution. It is not too long be
fore Crane becomes a believer in the
old legend as well.
The movie is directed by Tim Bur
ton, which is blatantly obvious. It has
all the typical Burton traits, including
being very very dark throughout the
film. So if you're looking for a bright,
cheerful movie, move on from this one
quickly.

The movie is very enjoyable.
Smarter than the Bond movie, it has a
number of twists which I certainly
didn't foresee. And though it is defi
nitely a dark movie, it has its lighter
moments. I can only believe that Depp
must have had a ball making it.
Depp does a commendable job

with the role of Crane, who
proves to be almost as
bumbling as his counterpart in
the short story. Ricci also gave
a fine performance as Depp's
love interest. And kudos to the
casting people for putting
Miranda Richardson m the
role of Katrma's stepmother;
this British actress needs more
recognition in the United
States, and hopefully this
movie will do that.
1 particularly enjoyed the
movie's comments about the
end of the era; seeing how the
story is set in 1799, references

from page S -

Sleepy Hollow was just

So it's December again: another winter, another finals week, an
other holiday season, and once more it's time for people to run around
like maniacs trying to buy carloads of "stuff" to give away at Christmas
or Hanukkah.
Holiday shopping gets more and more ridiculous every season
because greater amounts of people lose the real value of the holiday
season. Winter holidavs. at least the more common ones, are not about

someone else.
If you focus your holiday energies on sharing the time with other
people, rather than on the gifts, the season will pass with much less
stress and much more joy. Remember: the thought really is what counts.

Consider This

gift-giving, per se.
They are religious times of the year where
people gather to celebrate specific religious
events and to share fellowship. The giving of
gifts is a polite and generous practice that ac
companies the holiday, it is not the sole rea
son for the holiday.
Christmas isn't about having the biggest
tree, the most lights on the outside of the
house, the most presents or getting what you
really want from family and friends.
Be glad to see your family and friends, to
eat dinner with them and to share good times.
If you really need something you didn't get, you
can certainly buy it for yourself.
For most people, winter holidays have lost
the religious significance they were intended
to have.
In many Western traditions, the holidays
are a time to celebrate the meaning of life, the
joy of peace and fellowship within society. If
you happen to give or receive a nice present
in the process, consider it a bonus.

No matter what the season, simply re
member that people always come first. All the
neat toys and gadgets are meaningless with
out real relationships.
So this holiday season, be grateful for the
gift of friends and family, and don't concern
yourself so much with want you get or don't
get, or even if you can't find that perfect gift for

horn the feminist _Ironl
UN payment "deal" reveals Republican anti-family planning stance

m Rachu Harson
Columnist
Two weeks ago, the
House of Representatives and
President Clinton finally signed
a deal that would start the pay
ment of dues owed to the
United Nations by the United
States. However, this deal was
a success only for anti-choice
Republicans and will hurt mil
lions of women worldwide.
For three years, Rep.
Christopher H. Smith (R-NJ)
and other Republicans have
tied a ban on abortion rights to
the payment of nearly $1 bil
lion in dues owed to the UN.
The deal that was just signed is
a great victory for Smith and
his fellow conservatives.

The deal states that no
U.S. dollars will be given to in
ternational organizations who
promote abortion as a contra
ceptive option. President
Clinton can waive this ban

(which he most likely will do),
but it will result in $12.5 mil
lion being subtracted from the
$385 million that the Agency
for International Development
(a State Department agency)
gives to family planning groups
abroad. The penalty money,
which Republicans initially
wanted to be $100 million, will
go to a separate children's
health fund in the Agency.
The effects of this deal run
much deeper than it appears at
first glance. Monetary assis
tance from the U.S. will be de
nied to an agency even if they
use their own money to per
form, or even talk about, abor
tions. Organizations cannot
discuss with their patients the
dangers involved in unsafe abor
tions for fear of losing much
needed funding. If Clinton in
vokes the waiver, the agreement
states that only $15 million of
all the money that the U.S. gives
to family planning organiza
tions could go to organizations

that perform or advocate abor
tions. The Agency for Interna
tional Development says that
the family planning programs
they oversee have helped to
prevent unintended pregnan
cies in over 70 countries and

have seen the use of contracep
tives in those countries climb
from 10 percent to 40 percent
over the last 34 years. Unfor
tunately, the Agency has also
seen its funding drop dramati
cally. At its peak in 1995, the
budget was at $542 million.
Only four years later, however,

the budget is set at $385 bil
lion and will drop another
three percent to $372.5 million
with the waiver penalty.
It is extremely important
to realize what is being affected
by these Republican-induced
cutbacks. Less money will be
available for contraceptives
which will inevitably lead to
more unintended pregnancies
and a greater need for abortion
services. Less money will be
spent on stopping the spread
of sexually transmitted dis
eases, including HIV/AIDS, so
the numbers of the AIDS epi
demic will almost certainly
climb. Finally, less money will
be available to help reduce the
number of women who die
from pregnancy and childbirth
related causes (currently nearly
600,000 women each year), so
we will likely see more women
dying for such unnecessary rea-

Times by Kate Michelman,
president of the National Abor
tion and Reproductive Rights
Action League (NARAL),
"There is no U.S. funding for
abortions overseas. Since 1973,
federal law has prohibited the
use of U.S. international fam
ily planning funds to perform
or promote abortion. And
since 1981, any lobbying on
abortion has been banned."
With this in mind, it is
obvious that the real problem
Republicans have is not with
abortion, but with family plan
ning and the use of contracep
tives in general. These Con
gressional leaders still have a

sons. According to a November
19 editorial in the Los Angeles

Some have argued that
President Clinton is just as cul
pable as the Republicans in the
passage of this deal; in truth
Clinton was given no choice
but to sign the agreement. If
the U.S. had not paid at least
$111 million in back dues to
the UN by January 1, 2000, we
would have lost our seat in the
General Assembly. This would
have happened if Clinton did
not sign what anti-choice Re
publicans have called a com
promise and what Michelman
and NARAL call a "capitula
tion."

This absurd "deal,"
which irrelevantly tied family
planning to the payment of UN
dues, is but yet another step
towards erasing the Supreme
Court decision in Roe v. Wade.
The two issues are entirely
separate and should never have
been linked. As people start to
consider who they wilf vote for
in the next election, everyone
who cares at all about women's
rights should remember this
particular instance; it shows
that many Republicans are not
only anti-choice, but also
against all forms of family plan
ning.

Radical Feminism

Exposing American Liberalism:

harassment laws. Before we
begin, let me state that there is
such a thing as sexual harass
ment and unlike any Radical
Feminist, I will define it.
Sexual harassment is
when and employer demands
sexual favors from an employee
with a threat to the employee's
job. This is the original legal
definition.
Radical Feminists have
redefined the term to include
any comment of any sort of a
suggestive nature, even if it is a
complement like "you're cute"
said to a woman by a man.
The reverse is not true.
They maintain a woman can still
say anything about a man, even
if it is of an outright sexual na
ture. All this does is create ten
sion between the sexes; guys do
not know how to treat a woman
anymore, for fear of being hit
with sexual harassment law
suits, and women don't know

This week's look at the
inconsistencies and
"uncompassion" of American
Liberalism deals with the Femi
nist movement, and the myth
that they care about women or
family or even equality.
Radical Feminists do not
care about women or families,
but about creating conflict be
tween the sexes, killing the un
born, and attempting to give
women dominance over men.
J should state here that not all
feminists are this radical, but a
very large number of them are.
One of the biggest myths
of the Radical _Feminist move
ment is that they seek to pro
mote harmony among the
sexes. Their actions and po
lices prove otherwise. A good
example of this is the sexual

how to act either.
Since I went into abor
tion in an column that came
out recently, I will not dwell
on it here, but something small
must be said. Radical Femi
nists claim to be in favor of the
family, but they actively sup
port the murder of its mem
bers. They claim to be in fa
vor of women's rights and
honor past Feminists, but they
forget the original feminists
were PRO-LIFE. They claim
to be good people, but they
actively supported and con
tinue to support the genocide
of 35,000,000 American ba
bies in the last 25 years. This
is a contradiction of horrific
proportions.

interested in female superior
ity. They hold a view of men
as the root of all evil and
women as the epitome of vir
tue. Signs of this have even
shown on our own campus.
Last month, a group on this
campus had flyers distributed
to all our mailboxes for "Do
mestic Violence Awareness
Month."
These flyers consistently
labeled males as the sole per
petrators of domestic violence.
Simple common sense will tell
you that this is false.
In a country of
270,000,000 people, is it not
conceivable that just one
woman may hit a man in a do
mestic setting? Obviously it is
more than one, but the point is
made. The fact of the matter

Aahhh, Thanksgiving... a
time of joyous celebration be
tween loved ones. A time in
which we all must reflect upon
the gifts and blessings we have
received over the course of the
past year. It is also a time when
we gather with loved ones to
gorge ourselves through a cer
emonial feast involving slain
poultry and oddly shaped
canned fruit. Truly it is a great
American holiday.
For many of us it was a
welcome break, and for many

others it was a time of family
frustration brought on by too
much wine and too much ten
sion at the dinner table. I al
ways liked Thanksgiving for
this one simple pleasure - the
pleasure of catching up on the
family gossip and because it is
only at the Thanksgiving table
that I learn what I did wrong
over the previous year_.
The joy of family life is
overwhelming in this way, and
maybe that is why we only
choose to celebrate it once a
year. However, as one of my
closest friends said to me " you
don't have too much to be
thankful for when you wake up

at 8:00 Thanksgiving morning,
suck down two cups of navy
coffee and five cigarettes, and

then start typing your r " ing
thesis!"
While many of us were
eating our turkey and the
bready treat of stuffing, there
was a contingent of disgruntled
students amongst our ranks
slaving away trying to complete
a senior thesis. This traditional
right of passage for many
graduates has been the heaven
and hell to many of us over the
past few weeks or past few
days, and the author is not ex
cluded.
While I sit here and pen
this long drawn column (from
mouth" according
Mr. Ramius), I am

a "clap trap
to a certain
spending
valuable time away
from the
study car
rel which
has been
my spouse
over the
last few
nights.

"The three gray
hairs I found last night
prove that I have either
died and am in a hell of
my own creation or that
I have reached scholas
tic maturity."

just ~~——-————
as I am now married to the li
brary, my salvation has come
through a blend of coffee, salt,
and nicotine which has fla
vored my worn body so that
now I emit the pleasant aroma
of dcademia to all of those so
fortunate to sit near me.
In addition, the three
gray hairs 1 found last night at
two a.m. prove that I have ei
ther died and am in a hell (or
purgatory, for the papist con
tingent) of my own creation, or

that 1 have reached scholastic
maturity. Either way, I feel like
a much better person as my
optimism is ripped out of my
warm heart and replaced with
documents and figures.
Now 1 don't expect any
pity, and 1 don't want any con
soling (because when people
smile at me now I become en
raged). No, I just want to pro
vide <m accurate picture to all
the young-ins out there of the
most stressful experience yet in
my own academic career. The
sad thing is that when I pursue

my studies it will only get worse
and I probably won't even have
this column to restore even a
part of my previous sanity.
Part of my own frustra
tion is trying to provide one
document, one single piece of
work, which will reflect all that
I have learned over the last few
years. I want to have some
thing to justify all of this - and
hopefully next week I will have
that desired text and maybe,
just maybe, I will get some
sleep. Well until finals.
As I have been writing
this, several of my fellow col
leagues have been giving me
quotes of inspiration. For ex¬

ample, one
person said
"I'm gonna
beat the hell
out of the
next person
who asks
me how it's
coming."
That would
at least be
entertain¬

ing. Another told me that
"Dan Jewett didn't smile for
two months when he was writ
ing his." I know this particu
lar one to be true. What I will
take away from this experience
is the knowledge that camara
derie can exist at four in the
morning on the fourth floor of
the library.
I know that at least until
next week, the free tea and cof
fee after midnight is the one
thing I look forward to each
day. Yet through all of this
misery and through all of this
stress, 1 can comment that truly,
this is the stuff that dreams are
made of. Well, not exactly,
since when I fell asleep in the
library last night, I dreamt that
past president (and not to in
criminate the author 1 will only
call him "MIKE") was chasing
me with a pitchfork through a
cornfield.
Now these are the dreams
that a thesis is made of.

Top Ten Quotes Of The 20th Century

by Alex Ross
Campus Correspondent -
Tulane University
This week I'm going low.
Really low.
I'm dancing with sea ur
chins, three-legged rats, fresh
men and studentgovernment
representatives.
If this trend continues,
soon I'll be looking sorority
girls in the eyes. (Good God,
save me. Save me from the
fire!) Anyway, due to the prod
ding of a couple of close friends
of mine (I like to call them Mr.
Sock and Mr. Pencil), I've de
cided to shed my morals and
embrace the vulgar. I've created
my own, personal, top ten list
of the 20th century.

On what? Well, it took
me a while to figure it out. Af
ter doing extensive research, I
discovered that every some
what legitimate, respectable
and pertinent list had already
been compiled and printed.
From ESPN's "100 Greatest

Athletes of Our Century" to my
roommate's "Top Ten Reasons
Why Physics Is Controlled Sub
stance" to the Modern
Library's "Top 100 best En
glish-language Novels of the
20th Century" to my
girlfriend's "30 Reasons Why
Faulkner Should've Just Given
Up," there was seemingly no
where left for me turn.
But, fortunately, Mr. Sock
informed me of one subject that
had yet to be exploited. And,
naturally, I've decided to go
there. So, I've gone ahead and

compiled "The Top Ten Quotes
of the 20th century." (Do you
smell something burning?)
I took the quotes from a
variety of individuals from
many different social, political
and historical contexts. These
quotes defined lives, moved
nations and provided hope for
millions. And now, for your
convenience, I've stripped
them of their due glory and as
sembled them here, in my own
top ten list. In addition, with
each quote I've provided a brief
commentary so as to distract

you, the reader, from the
quote's undoubtedly profound
meaning. "
You can thank me later.
THE TOP TEN QUOTES OF
THE 20th CENTURY
10.) "The trick is to stop
thinking about it as 'your'
money." — IRS auditor. Funny,
I could've sworn a university
administrator somewhere said
this — on more than one occa
sion.
9.) "I was recently on a tour
of Latin America, and the only
regret I have was that I didn't
study Latin harder in school so
I could converse with those
people." — Dan Quayle. I won
der what Dan's mom's biggest
regret is.
8.) "What do you take me
for, an idiot?" — General
Charles de Gaulle when a jour
nalist asked him if he was
happy. Thanks for the quote,
General. Oh, and yes, we do
take you for an idiot.

7.) "Who the hell wants to
hear actors talk?" — H. M.
Warner, founder of Warner
Brothers. Mr. Warner could

just smell Keanu Reeves on the
distant horizon, couldn't he?
6.) "University politics are
vicious precisely because the
stakes are so small." — Henry
Kissinger. This one is for stu
dent government yahoos on
campuses everywhere. May
you continue to discuss, form

co, up our money
and of course, win elections
with a .0003% student turn out
(Up .0001% from last year!).
Oh, did I mention discuss, form
committees and eat up our
money?
5.) "It took me fifteen years
to discover I had no talent for
writing, but I couldn't give it
up because by that time I was
too famous." —Anonymous. A
friend of mine told me that if
anybody, John Gnsham said
this quote. "Fifteen years?" I
responded. "For Gnsham, try
fifteen minutes."
4.) "Outside of the killings,
Washington has one of the low
est crime rates in the country."
— Mayor Marion Carry, Wash
ington, DC. Maybe a few uni
versity presidents out there

should consider hiring Mr.
Barry: "Outside of our drop in
rankings; despite the fact that
most students are, by defini
tion, alcoholics; outside the
fact that our library is sinking;
this is still one of the best
schools in the nat'on."
3.) "In the beginning, the
Universe was created. This has
made a lot of people very an
gry and is widely regarded as a
bad move." — Douglas Adams,
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the
Galaxy. I have my own version
of this quote: "In the begin
ning, (The name of your
school's mam rival goes here.)
was created. This has pissed off
a good number of decent hu
man beings and was generally
regarded as a stupid, stupid,
stupid move."
2.) "I would have made a
good Pope." — Richard M.
Nixon. You just can't argue
with common sense.

1.) "The sooner I fall be
hind, the more time I have to
catch up." -Anonymous. Truly
the creed of every college stu
rlpnc.

Radical Feminism

continued from page 12

is it happens both ways, as
does sexual harassment and
rape, but Radical Feminists
will not admit that, because
they would then have to ad
mit that men and women are
equal. In my last column, "A
Spider "Wfeb, not a Safety Net,"
I discussed in a roundabout
way tax-and-spend liberalism;
the topic rears its ugly head
again in the Radical Feminist
movement, but for a different
reason. This time it is to pun
ish men for being what they
have no _flpntrol over: for be
ing men;
It w»s the desire, at one
time, of tile National Organi
zation of (liberal) Women, or
NOW, to place a tax on men,
supposedly to pay for rape
victims. Assuming that was

their actual motive, they
would be punishing the many
for the actions of a few, and
not even including all of the
perpetrators, so essentially in
the end they would be pun
ishing men just because they
are men. America was
founded on the principles of
equal justice for all. Does this
sound like equal justice?
Finally, I want to state
that I believe in equality of the
sexes. We are all Americans,
we are all created equal. I
state this to head off at the
pass the Radical Feminist
counter-attack that I'm a sex
ist. I am not the sexist: they
are. Don't just take my word
for it, look at their actions, not
their sound bytes. You will see
their actions tell a very differ
ent story.

For the past several
weeks, the winter sports season
has gotten underway. The fol
lowing is a capsule summary of
each winter sports team:

Last Season's Record: 16-10,

Outlook: The Bullets return
their starting frontcourt from

earning a trip to the Centen
nial Conference playoffs. Af
ter four games, Bill Davidson

Last Season's Record: 13-11,

Key Returning Players: Carrie

Sr., F; Jamie Dawson, Sr., C;

iams, So., G; Jen Nolan, So.,
G; Sarah Payne, J r., G; Katie
Havens, So., F.
Key Newcomers; Colleen
Bruce, F; Cory Dallas, F; Jay
Hodge, C.

Outlook: Head Coach Mike
Kirkpatrick has already found
himself with a problem, albeit
a good one. He simply has too
many capable players. The
Lady Bullets go nine deep and
in many cases the reserves are
virtually interchangeable with
the starters. With a deep bench
and deft skill, it is no wonder
that Gettysburg is aiming to

make the conference playoffs
and win the title, which would
give them an automatic berth

Senior Jamie Dawson will
anchor the middle this
season for the Lady Bullets

to the NCAA tournament.
The Lady Bullets do have
a big void to fill in the middle,
with the graduation of the
school's all-time rebounding
leader Megan Malloy. Starting
center Jamie Dawson and a pair
of freshman, Cory Dallas and
Jay Hodge should help shoul
der the rebounding load.
On the perimeter, the
women are skilled and athletic.
Mandy Wilson will run the
show at the point and Steph
Drevna, last season's leading
scorer, will play the shooting
guard position. Rotating in at
the guard positions are Kelsey
Williams and Jen Nolan, a duo
which would be a starting
backcourt nearly anywhere else
in the conference. Swingmen
Carrie Kulp and Megan
McDonald round out the start
ing five. Both are dangerous
scorers from the perimeter and
the paint. In the early going,
Kulp is leading the team in scor
ing at 16 a clip.

Senior guard, Ryan Napp (shown here in action last season)
is averaging 10 ppg. in the early going.

players coming off the bench
for significant minutes. Guards
Curtis McNeill and Jim Natale
have made contributions, as
well as forward Mike Monroe
and backup center Kevm Boyle.
In the season opener, the
Bullets defeated Hiram College
(Ohio) 80-64. The Bullets
were down two at the half but
came out of intermission strong
with a 15-0 run early in the sec
ond half. Davidson nailed
three three's during the run.
The Bullets never looked
back and earned a trip to the
final. Davidson and McNeill
led scorers with 22 and 17
points, respectively.
The Bullets then topped
Virginia Wesleyan 79-76 in the
title game. Napp put the Bul
lets ahead 19-18 with a three
point basket and the Bullets

The men's basketball
team started strong with two
wins in the Days Inn Tip-Off
Tournament as Gettysburg
brought home the team title.
Senior Bill Davidson was
named tournament MVP and
junior Greg Schreiber was also
named to the all-tournament
team. This year the frontcourt
of Rich Pfiel, Schreiber, and
Davdison all returned from last
year. Sophomore Terrence
Callahan and senior veteran
Ryan Napp filled the starting
spots in the backcourt.
This season the Bullets
are nine deep and have four

nevei trailed again. Schreiber
led Bullet scorers with 20 and
Davidson added 19. McNeill
chipped in 16 points of the
bench.
In the next two games,
the Bullets were dealt two
losses. Messiah College sur
prised the Bullets with tena
cious play, beating the Bullets
for the first time since the
1983-84 season and the first
time in ten games.
The Bullets came up short
in a second half rally and fell

73-71.
Davidson, who led the
Bullets with 24 points and
seven rebounds, was named to
the Centennial Conference
Weekly Honor Roll for the sec
ond consecutive week.
The Bullets then traveled
to York College this past Mon
day and were handed a 65-57
loss. The Bullets were ahead
5 1-46, but York went on a 19
6 run to end the game.
In the loss, Davidson led
the Bullets with 24 points,
while Boyle pulled down a
team high seven rebounds.
Callahan handed out four as
sists and recorded four steals.
Despite the loss, the men
aie looking to a successful sea
son. The Bullets open Centen
nial Conference play on Satur
dav at Washington College and
host Johns Hopkins Wednes
day in their next home contest.

Men's Swimming
Head Coach: Mike Rawleigh
Last Season's Recoid: Centen
nial Conference Champions
Key Returning Swimmers:
Mark Beckler, Jamey
Gallagher, Chris Hill, Brett
Montich_, Tim Valentine, J on
Hegna, David Lavigne, Kris
Nessler, Mike Robinson.

Women's

Head Coach: Mike Rawleigh
Last Season's Record: Centen
nial Conference Champions
Key Losses: 6 seniors
Key Returning Swimmers:
Kelly Brennan, Karin Olmsted,
Missy West, Nicole

Leanne Rebuck.
Key Newcomers: Liz Janelle,
Julia Girman, Maura O'Brien,
Brieanne Pufiis

Key Newcomers: Tom
Leupold, Sean O ' Connor, Dave
Walters.
Outlook: Although the Bullets
lost four seniors, they look to
build on their string of six con
secutive Centennial Confer
ence championships. The team
has a lot of depth, and despite
an early season loss to Wash
ington, they have the determi
nation and skill to defend their
conference title.
Outlook: The Lady Bul
lets have much depth and tal
ent. There are many national
caliber swimmers within the
squad. The freshman class is
particularly strong and should
contribute much to the team
this season.

"We are looking really
strong." said captain Karin
Olmsted. "The freshman class
especially. They will really
carry us this season."
The women are looking
to defend their conference title,
which thus far looks strongly
in their favor, and to qualify
more individuals and relays for

On their marks: Lady Bullet swimmers prepare to plunge into

Outlook: Coach Dell has a
good mixture of upper and
lower classmen. The Bullets
are coming off a disappointing
season and graduated one of
their best wrestlers, Marty
Scarpato.
"The team will have a
good mix of older wrestlers, as
well some sophomores and
freshman who will contribute,"
said Dell. "We should be im
proved from last season. How
improved is yet to be seen."

Women's hoops off to best start in 38 years
With balanced attack, Lady Bullets push record to 4-0

From Staff Reporis
The Lady Bullets pushed their
record to 4-0 this season, their best start
since the 1961-62 campaign.
The women started the season by
winning the Frostburg State Tip-Off
Tournament. In the first game, senior
Carrie Kulp led the Bullets with a ca
reer-high 20 points and 10 rebounds
and senior Jamie Dawson added an
other 14 points and nine boards, as Get
tysburg downed Wesley College, 64-58.
The next night sophomore Kelsey
"Williams led five players in double fig¬

ures with 21 points as Gettysburg de
feated host Frostburg State, 84-78, in
the championship game.
Dawson posted a double-double
with 15 points and a team-high 11 re
bounds for Gettysburg while Mandy
Wilson also accomplished the feat with
10 points and 10 rebounds. Kulp, who
scored 14 points in the win, was named
to the all-tournament team along with
Dawson and senior Megan McDonald.
Also scoring in double figures for
Gettysburg was sophomore Steph
Drevna, who finished the night with 10
points.

Following the championship vic
tory, Gettysburg began conference play
in their home opener against Haverford.
Kulp led the Bullet offense with 13
points as the Lady Bullets defeated
Haverford 73-43 in Centennial Confer
ence action.
With the win, the Bullets im¬

proved to 3-0 overall and 1-0 in con
ference play.
Drevna joined Kulp in double fig
ure scoring with ten points, while Wil
liams chipped in nine.
Leading the Gettysburg defense
were McDonald and Wilson, who both
posted four steals on the night as the
Bullets forced 38 turnovers from the
Haverford squad. Kulp and freshman
Jay Hodge each collected three steals
apiece.
Gettysburg led 39-20 at halfrime_,
and maintained dominance in the sec
ond half, shooting 66.7 percent from
three-point range and 71.4 percent
from the foul line.
The women returned to non-con
ference action following Thanksgiving
break. Hodge and Dawson led five
Bullets in double figures with 16 points
apiece to help Gettysburg defeat Villa
Julie, 95-35, in non-conference action
on Tuesday.

With the win, the Bullets im
proved to 4-0 for the first time since
the 1961-62 season. Gettysburg's 95
point performance was its highest out
put since a 110-46 win over St. Mary's
(Md.) on November 17, 1990.
Hodge's 16 points and team-lead
ing eight rebounds were both career
highs. Kulp scored 15 points in the
winning effort while McDonald added
14 points.
Williams also reached double fig
ures with 10 points for Gettysburg,
which shot 43-for-8l (53.1 percent)
from the floor and recorded 21 steals

on 45 Mustang
turnovers.

Drevna each
recorded a
team-high four

thirty points at
the half.

helped key the
Lady Bullets'
early success.

all-tournament
team at

State and
