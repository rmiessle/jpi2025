Discrimination in Gettysburg:
a myth or a harsh reality?

By the Racial and E think
Diversity Commission

A survey conducted by the
college's Racial and Ethnic Diversity
Commission has documented some of
the difficulties of being a student of
color in the unwelcoming atmosphere
at predominantly white Gettysburg
College. The Racial and Ethnic Diver
sity Commission (REDCom) serves as
an advisory commission to the Presi
dent (who appoints its members) on
issues of racial and ethnic diversity in
all aspects of campus life.
The REDCom's mandate is to
actively promote diversity in three are
nas: faculty, administrative and staff
hiring; student recruitment and reten
tion; and the racial and ethnic "cli
mate" on campus. REDCom has done
a number of things in pursuit of this
mandate in the four or five years of its
existence. This year it has mostly fo
cussed on the third item, campus cli
mate.

The current chair of REDCom is
Professor Deborah Barnes, and the rest
of its members are Robert Winans and
Manual Tejeda as faculty representa
tives; Dean Pete Curry and Pastor Jo
seph Donnella as administration rep
resentatives; Regina Campo and Lisa
Snyder as staff representatives; and two
students members, although at the
moment we are between student rep
resentatives. In addition, several oth
ers have acted as unofficial but active
volunteer members of the REDCom
these include Deborah Wailes, Suzanne
Johnson Flynn, Catherine Howard
Cecil Gray, and Terri Moore. Any of
these people can be contacted by stu
dents who might want to supply fur
ther information of the sort presented
in this report.
The Survey
Last semester, individual mem
bers of REDCom heard various com
plaints from individual students of
color at Gettysburg, both about the
generally negative campus climate for
them and about some specific, trou

blmg incidents. In December REDCom
invited a number of students of color to
its meeting and got an earful about the
stresses that students must constantly
deal with on this campus. This semes
ter REDCom decided to follow that with
a written survey sent out to all students
of color and all international students.
What follows is a report on that survey,
divided into four sections: comments on
interactions with townspeople, interac
tions with fellow students, interactions

the police have often displayed consid
erable hostility.
While we at the college may con
clude that we happen to be located in

indicates otherwise.
with staff and administrators at the col
lege, and interactions with faculty.
In Town
Gettysburg students of color en
counter negative attitudes and stressful
situations when they go into town. Both
Asian and African American students
commonly report derogatory or insult
ing comments made b) townspeople.
For instance, an Asian student reported
a man leaning out of his truck and mock
ingly speaking phony "oriental" lan
guage to her, and an African American

student reported that a professional per
son in town expressed surprise that she
spoke "good English" and that she did
not have "typical" African names.
Students of color have had signifi
cant problems at 7-Eleven, where a par
ticular assistant manager constantly
manifests a hostile attitude when stu
dents of color enter the store and who
clearly assumes that all young males of
color are there to steal. She has even
called the police, quite unjustifiably, and

an area that is not very enlightened on
racial matters, and that we do not have
any control over such attitudes, they
nonetheless represent one part of what
students of color must deal with every
day in this place.
Fellow Students
But, of course, all Gettysburg stu
dents spend much more time on cam
pus than off, and students of color are
harrassed or made uncomfortable by
some of their fellow students.
By chance the surveys were sent
put to students around the time of the
fraternity "ghetto" party that has re
cently made the news. A number of Af
pcan American students reported to us
tthat white students in their residence
pall asked them before the party how
to "be ghetto" (how to dress, act, etc.),
questions which these students found
offensive.
A student from Eastern Europe
reported being taunted and told that her
culture was inferior.

Asians students reported receiving
derogatory remarks by other students,
including one who reported that late at
night a male student screamed racist
insults at her.
African American students report
being told that the only reason they are
here at Gettysburg is because they are
black, and that they have an advantage
in "everything" because they are black.

Race Survey

a white student remark, "No
nigger will ever make it in the
world."
An African American stu
dent reported that students gen
erally are more rude to students
of color; as she put it meta
phorically, "they walk right
over top of you as if you are
not there."
Many women of color
don't feei weicome. They feel
ignored and not valued, and
they feel that no one on their
floors wants make friends with
them. Students of color feel the
pressure of being a "spokesper
son" for their race, and feel that
they become the "angry black"
when they speak up outside of
class. Conversation with white
students only happens if stu
dents of color initiate it; they
have to invite themselves to join
others at meals.

One African American
student feels that the rest of the
campus community wants her
to be "little Miss Ghetto
America."
Another African Ameri
can student stated that an in
sidious process of being "bro
ken down" begins on the first
day students of color arrive.
In class, African American
female students feel that white
students see them as "the black
female" and take a "there she
goes again" attitude when they
voice their opinions. They be
gin not to speak up in class to
avoid such reactions.
An African American stu
dent reported a history major
in her African history class say-

continued from front page

ing that she did not think it was
worthwhile to learn African
history.
The insensitivity can be
very subtle, making it difficult
to combat. One Asian student
found it difficult to describe
the negative feelings he senses
from some on campus, sug
gesting that it is nonetheless
real even though he thinks "it
is almost impossible for some
one who is not minority to un
derstand."
Another Asian student
feels that white students regu
larly act differently toward stu
dents of different colors/cul
tures, who are subjected to
"subtle forms of discrimination
all the time."
Staff and Administrators
Students of color on this
campus also find that some
support staff or administrators
of the college make them feel
unwelcome.

A male student of color
reported that, in an incident at
the Lamppost, where he had
run out to help a student who
was being attacked by several
town youths, he ended up be
ing treated as a suspect and in
stigator by
Campus Security.
An African American stu
dent reported that a member
of the dining room staff
wrongly accused him of steal
ing refreshments after an Afri
can American workshop and
went on to suggest that she was
upset that he was attending the
same college as her own son.

The Faculty
Some faculty members
also contribute to the stresses
students of color face on this
campus.
As the only black stu
dents in their classes, African
American students frequently
feel little support from their
professors, wondering if the
professors think they are of
lesser intelligence.
An Asian student recalled
a professor automatically as
suming that she knew about
each of the countries of South
east Asia because she came
from that part of the world.
One student reported
several instances this semester
where, because she is black, a
faculty member has called on
her or expected her to answer
on behalf of the race when the
course is dealing with issues of
Black people.

Other African American
students pointed out that they
felt they were being called on
in class only when the topic of
discussion related to race.
A professor asked a ques
tion in class about two obscure
European authors; an African
American female student was
the only one to answer the
question; the professor ex
pressed shock that she knew
the answer.
An international student
learned that a faculty membei
wrote in a recommendation for
a job that the student might not
be suitable because she w_.is
from a different culture.
An African American stu
dent complained about a pai
ticular professor's "utter disre¬

gard for the humanity and mo
rality of people of color."
One might expect that
faculty members would be
more enlightened than others
on issues of race and color, but
some clearly are not.
Conclusion
REDCom finds the com
ments of the students surveyed
believable and takes them seri
ously, hoping that the rest of the
college community will do so
also. The results of this survey
make evident the inhospitable

climate students of color have
to deal with daily here at Get
tysburg, both on and oft cam
pus. The majority of students,
staff, administrators, and fac
ulty at Gettysburg may not be
implicated in such attitudes and
behaviors as those reported
here, but enough are implicated
that it is no wonder that the
college has difficulty attracting
and keeping students of color,
difficulty, that is, in maintain
ing a desirable diversity that
reflects the diversity of the so
ciety around us.

REDCom hopes that
making the college community
aware of these matters will be
the first step in rediessing them,
allowing those who are perhaps
inadveitently insensitive to
ward students of color to avoid
such behavior in the future.
The suivey repotted on here is
the first of .in ongoing senes of
annual efforts, by both written
and stiuctured oral means, to
elicit responses horn students
of color about what effects race
oi ethnicity have on their lives
here at Gettysburg.

Gettysburg to give high-tech
eHistory prize

From GCPR
A new annual prize for
the best web site, CD-ROM
or other scholarly high
technology tool that explores
the Civil War era has been es
tablished by the Lincoln and
Soldiers Institute at Gettys
burg College.
The winner or winners
of the inaugural "eLincoln
Prize," which carries a
$50,000 award, will be an
nounced on Lincoln's Birth
day - February 12, 2001 -
along with the winners of the
Institute's Lincoln Prize, an
annual $50,000 prize for the
best work in the Civil War
field.

Like the Lincoln _Pn/c,
the new eLincoln Pi izc wmnti
will also receive a sculpted bust
of Abraham Lincoln by
Augustus St. Gaudens. Both
prizes are endowed by Rich
ard Gilder and Lewis
Lehrman, business leaders and
philanthropists with a long
standing interest in American
history.
The establishment of the
eLincoln Prize was announced
April 18 at the annual New
York City dinner honoring the
winners of the 2000 Lincoln
Prize (see
www.gettysburg.edu/academ
ics/cwi/1 in coin prize for a
complete list of winners).
Ironically, the announcement
came on the tenth anniversary

of the Lincoln Prize - most of
ten given to books - which was
presented in 1990 to Ken
Burns for his documentary
"The Civil War."
"This new prize recog
nizes all that the Internet cur
rently represents, as well as all
of its vast potential," said
Gabor Boritt, the Robert C.
Fluhrer Professor of Civil War
Studies at Gettysburg College
and chair of the Lincoln Prize
Board of Trustees. "The
Internet's potential on the field
of history is immeasurable. We
hope that the eLincoln Prize
speeds the development of that
potential."
A jury of scholars will
|udge the submissions for the
eLincoln Prize. The inaugural
|ury will be Janice Reiff of

UCLA; David Herbert
Donald, professor emeritus
from Harvard University and
a Lincoln Prize Laureate: and
Drew Gilpin Faust, who will
begin working as the first
dean of Harvard University's
new Radcliffe Institute for
Advanced Study in January.
The deadline for sub
missions for the eLincoln
Prize will be in the fall of
2000, with the date to be an
nounced. For more informa
tion, please contact Tina
Grim, program mangager of
the Civil War Institute, at 717
337-6590. Submissions for
the eLincoln Prize may be sent

Gettysburg comes together to
support at-risk children

by Kevin Lee
Contriri iTTNr: Wrttfr

Many students may have noticed
or encountered some of the 31 children
from Sandtown, Baltimore, who spent
the night on campus a few weeks ago.
Let me enlighten you about the details
behind one of the most special service
programs that I have observed on the
Gettysburg campus.
The college campus demon
strated unity and genuine concern for
innercity youth by bringing students
from Coleman Elementary and Lemmel
Middle School to campus for an over
night visit. From the moment the kids
arrived at Gettysburg on Tuesday after
noon, they spent their time engaged in
a variety of activities including dining
at Servo, swimming in the pool, work
ing with GRAB representative Sarah
Calhoun on team-building tasks, tak
ing campus tours, and having an ice
cream and movie party in CUB 260.

Students slept Tuesday night in
residence halls with the college students
who have tutored and worked with
them all year. The excitement displayed
by the children involved tells the
story—that this experience will remain
in the kids' memories for a very long
time to come.
Since the beginning of the fall se
mester, Gettysburg students have vol
unteered their Saturday mornings ev
ery week to travel to this troubled
neighborhood in West Baltimore.
There, they provide tutoring services to
children at both the elementary and
middle schools. For the past six weeks,
the tutoring program has incorporated
the McBride College Bound program
into its curriculum. This additional
program has been carried out by stu
dent facilitators Sarah Person, Curran
Geist, Jenna Mulford, Laura Root,
Krissi Fisher, Tim Foster, Alison Wood,
Peter Dervan, and Sarah Rafferty.

McBride, a national non-profit
organization based in New Mexico,
aims to have college students enter the
classrooms ot Title I school systems.
These college students conduct an in
teractive program that teaches children
in areas such as Sandtown to contem
plate their futures. Special emphasis is

placed on the importance of post-sec
ondary education.
The success of this program is
largely due to the support of the cam
pus community. For this reason, the
Center for Public Service would like to
extend sincere thanks to everyone who
has participated in making this program
a success. More than 50 students par
ticipated in some or all of the events on
Tuesday and Wednesday.
Different academic departments
offered to show the visiting students
some interesting things during the cam
pus tour, such as the rat lab in the Psy
chology Department. A variety of or
ganizations on campus, including
G.E.C.O., Admissions, Facilities, ICON
printing, Musselman Library, the Col
lege Bookstore, and WZBT, donated
souvenirs for the kids to take home with
them.

Traditionally, this program has
ended each year with a daytime cam
pus visit and tour. This year was the
first time that a sleepover was at
tempted, and it was a huge success. The
overnight experience helped to give the
students from Baltimore a "real" idea
of what college is all about. Well...at
least somewhat real. I did have to an
swer "not always" to a little girl who
asked me if "college is always this much
fun?" With our work in Sandtown for
1999-2000 at a close, CPS looks to the
future with excitement; plans are being
made for program development and
growth, and we hope for even more
campus involvement next year. We also
hope that all persons who participated
in Sandtown Projects this year have
gained an increased awareness of the
issues surrounding inner-city life, as well
as a sense of personal satisfaction for
having helped to better the lives of chil
dren in a community in need of sup
port.

My personal thanks go out to all
those who have put their time, energy,
and passion for serving others to such a
worthwhile cause.
If you are interested in getting
involved in working with the Sandtown
community, please contact the Center
for Public Service for more information
at x6490 or email "serve".

What is college like?
Some children's perspectives

"I learned that to go to college you need to go to elementary
then junior high school and high school. Then you will be at col
lege." ""I want to go to college because I want to learn about being a
doctor. I think that you should go to college to get a good job like
me." "You can do what you want in college. You can eat at the
dining hall. You can go outside and play soccer. You can sleep on
bump beds."
"At Gettysburg College, students take a lot of class. But they
also do other sutff. They take sports, art, and music."
"If you get good grades, the people that own the college will
want you to come to their college. They might give you a scholar
ship and a grant."

Don't need it? Take it to the Truck

By Kristin Roberts
Features Editor
As the end of the semes
ter approaches, many students
possibly dread the prospect of
packing up an entire room and
taking it all home. Without a
doubt, many students have ac
cumulated a significant amount
of "stuff" that just won't fit
into the loaded car. The sim
plest solution to this glitch in
the process of traveling home
is the nearest trash can. How
ever, a more environment- and
society-friendly destination for

these unwanted items will soon
arrive on campus.
The G.E.C.O. Truck pro
vides the perfect alternative to
permanent disposal of "stuff."
On Friday, May 5, the College
will rent two U-Haul trucks for
this purpose. Beginning on
Sunday, the trucks will accept
donations of reusable items
that might otherwise be thrown
away. These items will then be
delivered to a number of orga
nizations and shelters, both
here in Adams County, and far
ther away.

The Truck program,
which in the past has consisted
of a single truck, will include
two vehicles this year. They
will be located outside Rice
Hall and beside Apple Hall.

The truck by Rice will have
staff on board to supervise do
nations, but the one at Apple
will be experimentally
unstaffed. The trucks will ac
cept donations all day, any day,
until the following Sunday,
May 14.
Since the term "reusable
item" seems vague, here is an
idea of what sorts of things the
Trucks will welcome, and
where they will take those
goods. Large commodities,
such as furniture, lamps, and
appliances—even computers,
will go to local shelters includ¬

ing the Adams County Home
less Shelter, the Senior Center,
Survivors, and the Foster Par
ents Association.
More portable materials,
such as clothing, dishes, sheets,
pillows, and towels go to these
places, and they are also sent
to Nicaragua; they are donated
to organizations in
Gettysburg's sister city, Leone.
Other centers receiving dona
tions of this type include Habi
tat for Humanity, the Adams
County Office of Aging, and
the Inter-faith Housing Coun
sel.

Small items that may
seem insignificant to a college
student are valuable to the or
ganizations which pass them on
to less advantaged people.
These items include non-Der-

lshable foods, partially used
bottles of shampoo, extra
school supplies, boxes of tis
sues, and dust pans and
brooms. Charities such as Chil
dren and Youth Services, the
Adams County Food Pantry,
and the Gettysburg Soup
Kitchen, as well as those al
ready mentioned, never have
enough of these staples.
Basically, anything that is
clean and in functional condi
tion may be donated to the
G.E.C.O. Truck. If an item

"Hol d on " to y our dreams

by Anne Schenk
Book Reviewer
David Isay and Harvey
Wang. Holding On. New
York: W.W. Norton & Co,
1996. 216 pp.
Seniors, what will you be
doing when you graduate? Per
haps you'll pick up castle build
ing in your spare time, become
a serpent handler, or pursue a
career in grain scooping. Or
may be you'll restore manne
quins, grow a dinosaur garden
of your own, keep a minute-by
minute diary of your life, or
become the next curator of the
Exotic World Museum.
Anything is possible, and
as Holding On, by David Isay

and Harvey Wang, shows us,
nothing is too eccentric or too
mundane to pursue.
Holding On is a collec
tion of essays and photographs
that originated from a series
called "The American Folklife
Radio Project" which aired on
National Public Radio. The
essays highlight "dreamers, vi
sionaries, eccentrics, and other
American heroes." These are
people the authors believe tell
a story of sacrifice, a sort of
human perseverance in the face
of muffled hopelessness which
makes them heroes in their
own right.
Take for example Donald
Beam, whose lifelong obsession
with dinosaurs led him to fi
nally open up Dinosaur Gar
dens at his home in Moscow,

Texas. Dinosaur Gardens,
home to eleven life-sized fiber
glass dinosaurs, cost Donald
and his wife almost $100,000,
and when it opened, it was

without any real fanfare. So
now Donald wanders through
the park hoping that maybe
tomorrow the crowds will
come, while his wife works at
a local convenience store to
support them. While some
might think his story pathetic,
Bean's unbridled passion for his
dinosaurs and his willingness to
go the extra mile to make his
dreams come true is more in
spiring than anything else.
Holding On continues
with similar stones: men and
woman hidden away in towns
across the United States. These
individuals' pride and belief in
what they do is simply not
found within the boundaries
most of us would consider re
alistic or even normal. Some
times we hear their stories right

from their very own mouths,
and sometimes through inter
views, or just through the glim
mers of what Isay and Wang tell
us. But no matter how we
come to know these home
grown heroes, the message is
not missed: Follow your pas
sions and dreams, shared or
not, and you will find happi
ness. Gettysburg grads and
grad-hopefuls, this collection
of essays tells a story that you
won't want to miss. No mat
ter where your life takes you
and no matter what your
dreams may be, nothing will
bring you more satisfaction that
finding something you believe
in. Even if it is collecting bells
or maintaining a coon dog
graveyard.



Hot workers,
late movies

BY LlBBY MUSSELMAN
Dear Libby,
Who is that enormously tai
nted, witty, smart and hard
vorking guy who works at the
:irculation desk. Give him a raise_,
_le_'s hot!
Unsigned
Dear Admirer,
That description fits just
ibout all the circulation desk
vorkers-both genders. I'm so
;lad you notice talent, energy and
;ood service. We think the desk
vorkers are great too. Libby
cnows it isn't an easy job, espe
:ially at this time of the year when
:veryone is in a bad mood and
tressed out. When other student
vorkers are quitting to cram for
ests, the circulation students con
inue to show up for work and
lelp out wherever needed. That's
)retty exceptional.

Dear Libby,
I do not understand what
rou guys are doing. I turned in a
novie at the appropriate time and
am sorry if one of your workers
nade a mistake in recording it.
Sut, I will not pay for a mistake
_>y one of your people. That is
mpressive on how you guys can
ust charge anyone you want by
naking mistakes on when things
ire returned. Maybe you guys
:an start a small business doing
his. Congratulations!
Name withheld
Dear Nameless,
Simmer down. Everybody
s tense at this time of the year_,
(bu don't have to send sarcastic
lotes to the Library. Libby
:hecked with circulation supervi
or Cinda Gibbon who pointed
_>ut that the computer records the
ime an item is returned and it is
>retty hard for the computer to
nake a mistake.

She also showed Libby how
:verything is checked-in twice, so
f by some miracle one of the
lard-working, conscientious stu
lent workers, referred to in the
ibove message, was temporarily
isleep on the job (which is rare
>al, very rare) then the second line
)f defense would catch the error.
X'e started double check in a year
igo, just to avoid this sort of situ
ition. Dear Libby,
Why can't students have
bod in the library when they are
tudying for finals. I need to study
i lot and write two papers!
Unsigned

Dear "Why,"
This food thing is so tire
some. Libby answers this ques
tion all the time but since you
mentioned studying for finals, and
Libby is feeling very, very sympa
thetic to people doing work right
now, she'll answer this one more
time. Fact: Humans are not neat.
They drop crumbs (even the care
ful ones) and don't clean up their
mess. Food attracts pests.
Libby has discovered other
places on campus where you can
study and eat at the same time.
Did you know that the CUB
serves free food every night of fi
nals, from 11pm until 2:00 am?
You can also sit on the front patio
of the library and eat.
Dear Libby,
Reserves is so inconvenient.
Why can't you keep a cart of
books for our class, all together
right behind the desk that we can
select from? We hate looking up
the call numbers. It is a waste of
our time. Our professor agrees
and is going to talk with you.

Two students in (class illeg
ible) Dear Twosome,
Libby really doubts that any
professor would think that was a
good idea, unless they were really
lazy themselves, and there aren't
any lazy faculty members at
Gettysburg College. In the old
days there wasn't any reserve and
students actually had to look up
books in a card catalog (histori
cal artifact) and go find the books
all over the stacks. Now that was
a pain.
Nowadays faculty make it
so easy for you it is sinful. They
actually put together a reserve
reading list and pull the books for
you and bring them to the reserve
desk, and all you have to do is
look up their name on the com
puter and get the call number.

Dear Libby,
I need my interlibrary loan
books until the end of finals. I
got a notice saying they were due.
I can't return them.
Likes ILL
Dear ILL,
Libby suggests you sit down
right now and take notes. Or go
to your nearest photocopy ma
chine and copy the relevant pages.
Unfortunately we don't set the
due date, the library that loaned
them tells us when to bring the
book back. All interlibrary loan
books are due back May 4.
Dear Libby,

How about opening
Special Collections for a
couple hours on Saturday?
No signature
Dear Special,
Libby heard that Special
Collections is the new hot spot.
The staff is thinking about
opening Sunday night next fall.
Stay tuned.
Reminder: If you have
a dispute with the Library
about whether a book has been
returned or not, DO NOT go
find the books on the shelves
yourself. Ask for a search or
request a desk worker to look
for you. Also, always take your
receipt when you pay a fine.
This will avoid some of these
unpleasant little altercations
happening lately.

Libby's thought for the
day: Theft may be the ultimate
form of flattery, but the art stu
dents who had their works sto
len from the Library would still
like them back.
Hearts from the College
archivist to all the students
who endured crowded condi
tions in Special Collections.
We appreciate your good hu
mor and willingness to sit on
the floor and share the
cramped space. We hope your
professors know the heroics
you endured to do your work.

Hearts to the circulation
staff for keeping the library
open around the clock all week
this week and next.
Darts to the childish per
son who scrawled the unkind
remarks on Bill Davidson's
poem on display in the library.
You might not agree the senti
ments in A Harlem Diner-1962
but that's no reason to write
your dumb drivel across his
work. If you don't like it, write
your own poem or don't read
this one. It is wrong to wreck
an exhibit and cntici/.
someone's work anonymously.

Libby wishes you all a
fruitful end to your semester
and a restful summer vacation.
Save your questions, sugges
tions and complaints until next
fall.

Boozes, binges, and
blackouts:

Misfortune without misgiving
in Panama

ky Jonathan
HUvlMERDINGER Staff Writer
Since the start of college,
I've been thinking that I've been
a little too crazy. Weekend frat
parties, off-campus keggers, and
the occasional week-night walk
to the bar have become rituals,
a large part of my tree time.
And who hasn't woken up on
Sunday morning and ques
tioned the sanity of the previ
ous evening's actions? Most
likely everyone has felt a bit of
guilt after tying-one on. We fear
(perhaps unnecessarily) that we
are slowly giving into the grips
of vice, soon to hit rock bottom.
Thomas McGuane_'s novel
Panama plays upon our fears of
being locked in vice and never
escaping Saturday night.
McGuane's character Chet
Pomeroy is past possibility, be
yond prevention, stuck in his

own monstrous creation.
Through Chet's flashbacks,
drunken stupors, and cocaine
induced dazes, McGuane draws
the reader into the life of a man
struggling for purchase against
his own pessimism and misfor
tune. Panama does not seek to
teach the reader about the ills
of drugs and alcohol, nor is it a
self-help novel. On the con
trary, as any McGuane reader
understands, Panama is more

comedy than drama. Through
the eyes of the arrgry, careless,
and pessimistic drunk Pomeroy,
McGuane reveals much about
us as humans.
Chet Pomeroy is a
drunken writer living in the
extreme. He has fallen from the
public eye, an ex-celebrity
down on his luck and search
ing for escape. Like many oth
ers, Pomeroy finds solace in
euphoric doses of drugs and
booze on the island of Key West
in rh<^ 1 970.1.. He is at war with

the world, getting his revenge
during his periods of intoxica
tion. He vomits on the mayor
of New York, nails his hand to
the door of his estranged wife's

house, knocks out her attorney,
and sleeps with her best friend.
He also struggles with LSD-like
flashbacks. Chet is convinced
that his estranged father is
dead, and that his personal
hero, the legendary gunslinger
Jesse James, still walks the
streets. Moreover, he has no
recollection of marrying his
wife Catherine many years ear
lier in the third-world country
of Panama. Chet blacks out so
often, in fact, that his wife hires
a private detective to observe
his actions. Every morning the
gumshoe approaches Chet and
reveals horrifying stories.
Once Chet was "cavorting in
the sand at Rest Beach at three
in the morning." Another time
he bounced a check for five
hundred thousand dollars with
out realizing it.

Through the flashbacks
of Chet Pomeroy, McGuane
reveals an honest, desperate
man, searching the bottle and
clutching a joint to discover
life's meaning. Surprisingly,
though quite intoxicated, Chet
knows what he wants and
knows the meaning of his life.
He has little care for the out
side world, and he ignores his
neighbors, their criticisms, and
his family. Chet wants only one
thing from life: to be forgiven
by Catherine.
Thomas McGuane, born
in Michigan in 1933, is well
known for his critique of mod
ern-American. He portrays
America as a twisted society
with backward cultural values.
Panama, like McGuane's other
works, ridicules popular cul
ture and laughs at modern mor
als.

Chet Pomeroy is the man
we fear we could become. He
is a character who, through his
brutal honesty and self-inflicted
misfortune, represents the
worst in all of us. Still, he is a
comedic hero, making the best
of his lot and cursing anyone
who criticizes him. Pomeroy's
motto for life seems to be "It's
my life I'm screwing with, so
leave me alone." Who could
not honor that?

Senior Reflections

BARB DICKSON
EDITOR-IN-CHIEF

It's hard to believe the
time has come for me to actu
ally write this. Ever since I
learned that senior staff mem
bers of the newspaper write
reflections for the last issue, I
knew that one day I would
write one. I've been planning
this since May of 1997. Even
with three years of preparation,
I still can't believe that the time
has come for my senior reflec
tion. My years at Gettysburg
College have been the best
years of my life—so far. I've
learned a lot here, and more
about myself than about the
history or literature I read. I've
learned that people actually lis
ten to me and respect my opin
ion. I've learned that I can lead
people. I've learned that the
most fascinating conversations
happen at the oddest time'; and
places. I've learned that life is
full of joy and tragedy.

The Burgian has been
such an integral part of my life
at Gettysburg and so many of
my memories involve the news
paper. I've learned to write, I've
learned to edit, I've learned to

lead (or try to), I've learned to
get by without sleep on
Wednesday nights, I've learned
to get along with others.
I want to thank all the
editors. You make the paper
and you made my job a lot
easier. Laura, Bill, Kathy,
Melodie, Chesha, Jessie,
Nadine, Carrie, Kristen,
Lauren: Thank you for putting
up with me when I got into odd
moods and went on the war
path. And thank you for doing
your jobs and making the pa
per look great. My goal was to
build the ego of the ed board
(this means you, Bill!); all you
have to do is look at the news
paper to feel good about the
work you do. For those of you
here next year, good luck.

Thanks to Sara and Bab
bitt, who came before me. You
supported me when I needed
it the most and made me feel I
could actually run this place.
Sara, I couldn't ask for a better
predecessor, and I can only
hope that I did half as good a
job as you did.
To Jack Ryan, who's had
to deal with a lot more crap

than a lot more people than
have. Thank you so much for
helping me through the past
year, and good luck in the fu¬

. My happiest newspaper
memories come from the days
of Larkin and Petro, Sprenkle,
Spicer, Melodie and Pepper. We
stayed up until 4 in the morn
ing just for the hell of it. 1 don't
think I've met funnier people
with the exception of Arcan,
whose main job was not man
aging editor or technology guy,
but making us laugh.
There are many others
that I want to thank, that 1 want
to express my gratitude to, and
I can barely begin here. My
little moinks (Cara and Liz),
Damien, Mary, Carrie,
Melodie, Becca, Brent, Steve,
Jody: Thank you for being the
bestfriends I've ever had. 1 love
you all dearly-more than I
could ever say.
Thank you for giving me
self-confidence again and
showing me that people do
want to be friends with me.
I also need to express my
gratitude to all the professors

who have done so much more
than teach me-Lambert, Shan
non, Flynn, Bowles, Bowman,
Fee, and Garnett. You made me
look forward to class.
And I need to thank one
final person: Casey Dunn. I
spent my 19th birthday at your
funeral; you helped me mature
from a teenager to an adult.
You showed me how to live life,
to enjoy the time I have and not
take anyone for granted.
So now I move on to the

real world. Underclassmen,
live life to the fullest while
you're here and grab every
chance that heads your way. I
hope to. Thank you,
Gettysburgian, for giving me a
place to express myself, even
if people don't appreciate it. In
the future, I will look back on
old issues and not see a news
paper, but my heart and soul,
because that's what I've poured
into this newspaper every week
for the last four years. And I
don't regret it for a minute.

DAN ARCARI
MANAGING EDITOR

At some point in the next
month, each senior will spend
their last real months on this
campus. Many of us will re
turn, to be certain, but we'll be
visitors hereafter, guests in a
place once our own. College
stands apart this way: it is tem
porary by design, and we know
that before the first book is
opened, before the first uncer
tain night spent in the dorm.
Yet we make it permanent, if
only for a while. For four years,
this was our college. We stud
ied here, grew up a little,
formed relationships (and dis
solved a few, too). We lived in
this place, for a little while.
Now we leave, ushered
on our way by teachers,

younger friends and family. We
are missed already, a regret
tempered by its inevitability.
We are old now, somehow
complete and prepared to de
part. The footsteps of the new
are heard not far off, and the
beckon attention and care now.
After a brilliant flash, we will
fade slowly, as snow come the
thaw of spring.
Think of how little we
see, four years at a place that
has seen almost two hundred.
What people and times are re
flected in the windows
Glatfelter, or the abbreviated
flag atop Penn Hall? This place
is an intersection, not of a road,
but of the path of time. Who
will sit, years from now, in the

very spot where I write this and
know nothing of who lived
here or what they did? (Who
sat here before me, I wonder?)
Before you leave, look
around at our campus as it is,
for it will never be quite the
same. Oh, we'll return: as a
teen drives past his grade
school playground, a parent
revisiting a childhood home.
We'll be back, but this place will
be smaller, simpler in appear
ance. The campus we walk to
day will demand no car ride or
plane ticket to revisit: in our
memory we store it forever. All
the laughter, the bizarre sight
of daybreak after a .night .spent
with a textbook instead of
dreams, the times that have

been hard on each of us, the
conversations with new friends
in the middle of the night or
the feeling of new knowledge
after special classes that creep
up every so otten. Those are
feelings and thoughts that will
become College to us, and they

photo by Sieve Spicer
cannot go away. We can miss
the feel of the sidewalk under
foot or the sounds of the train
as it thunders past in the dark
of night, but those things that
really matter never truly leave,
and we can come back to Col
lege whenever we please.

CHESHA MILLER
SPORTS EDITOR

It's midnight and I'm walk
ing across campus quickly headed
for Water Street, when I suddenly
pause. It is completely silent.
Standing in front of Wiedensall I
slowly turn and look at Penn Hall,
Glatfelter, and the library. I can
see the fountain all lit up in the
background. I breathe deeply. It
smells like Gettysburg. I inhale
warm, rainy air.
It is hard to believe I will be
leaving this place I have called
home for four years in just over
two weeks. From the very first day
I arrived on campus for cross
country preseason, Gettysburg has
been home. I remember then
thinking how long four years
was—little did I know hnw short

they would actually be.
Freshman year my friend
Alicia and I came up with "college
time." We equated every weekday
with three real days and we allot
ted five days for Saturday and Sun
day. That comes out to approxi
mately six years to every one
year... Yeah right. How little we
then realized our time would fly.
As I sit penning my last
Gettysburgian article I am filled
with a sense of completion. Hap
pily, I leave Gettysburg with no
regrets. Everything I wanted to do
and wanted to achieve I did...one
way or another. Things did not
always turn out like I wanted them
to, but for every mistake, failure,
and injury I am a wiser, stronger,
more confident person.

I am grateful to Gettysburg
College and all the excellent op
portunities my education and
"home" has afforded me. Yet, I
am most eternally indebted to the
people of Gettysburg. Each per
son I have come in contact with
has enriched my soul and shaped
me into the person I am proud to
be today.

Thank you to the
Gettysburgian. You have given me
a platform to express my opinions
and to grow as both a writer and a
leader. I have come a long way
since my first player profile article
when I was scared to death of in
terviewing Jake Dell. Thank you,
Sara, for your confidence in me
and for waiting for that "yes"
phone call. I never regretted fill
ing your shoes as the Sports Edi
tor and have loved every minute
of my position, even those crazy
late Wednesday nights junior year.
Getting to know our fine athletes

and coaches has been a blessing. I
have been proud to represent the
Bullets. Thank you also for all
those late night quotes...you know
who you are.
'Burgtan staff and editors.
Thank you for a wonderful ride.
Wednesday nights will never be the
same. Barb, Dan, Danielle,
Lauren, Kristin, Mel, Nadine,
Spicer—thank you for everything,
especially the $1 bags of popcorn.
Billy, I admire you more than you
realize and cherish your friend
ship. Thank you for being my
partner-in-crime and for calling
me a friend.

Gettysburg has one of the
greatest athletic departments and
I am grateful for everyone I have
come into contact with in Bream
Wright Hauser; the training room
staff, Kelly, Coach Condon, Coach
Shenk, and my wonderful cher
ished teammates. I will be sup
porting you and following you
from NY next year. Thank you
for all your support, love, and
friendship. And remember, Pack
it up! FCA. You guys gave me the
confidence and strength I need to
get through every day. I thank my
God for you and your support. I
am confident that I leave you in
the best of hands.

The English and Religion
departments have been so support
ive through all my questions, con
cerns and learning processes. Un
derclassmen, if you haven't yet
take a class with Jack Ryan,
Suzanne Flynn, Eli7abeth L.anibcit,
Bob Frednckson, and Bu/. Myers.
They are the best at what they do
and have truly inspired me to
strive for academic and intellectual
greatness.
All of these facets and activi
ties have bettered my college ex
perience, but nothing has been
better than the friendships I've
formed and memories I've cher
ished. Studying abroad (ASE-it's
the best thing I've ever done), run¬

ning on the battlefields, going to
the top of the big rower, watch
ing .1 Gettysburg sunset, Peace
Light chats, Kilwins, DQ runs, the
Ciieonbrier, crying, laughing, smil
ing, singing, hugging.
Heather Bee, Km, Kristy,
Kclley, Kim, Dan, Dave, Billy, Al,
Ike, hnka, Lisa...Thank you .ill tor
linking my college experience
what it was. I love you all.
Mv Water St. girls, I cher

Thank you tor the great big white

Thank you Gettysburg for a
wonderful, albeit short four years.
I will miss your sunsets, your servo
meals and...
yes, even your rainy days.

BILL DAVIDSON
SPORTS EDITOR

Reflecting on my time at
Gettysburg College, I am happy
that I decided to transfei here
three years ago. This is something
that I was not always able to say.
There were housing restrictions at
the time I transferred and I never
lived in a dorm. As a result, it took
me a long time before I got to
know a lot of people and in turn
felt comfortable. But in time I met
a lot of wonderful people and I
now only regret that I am leaving
some of you, without having got
ten to know you better.
My involvement in the
Gettysburg College community
can be divided into three main ar
eas: academics, athletics, and
working for the Gettysburgian. I
have thoroughly enjoyed all of my
classes here and this is due in large
part to our incredible faculty. Ev
ery professor 1 had impressed me,
both with their knowledge and
their helpfulness. As an IDS ma
jor, I had the chance to serve as

the student representative on the
IDS committee. This gave me the
chance to work with many fine
faculty members. My adviser, Jack
Ryan, spent countless hours with
me crafting my special ma]or pro
posal and helping me with my se
nior thesis. There was never any
thing I asked of him, which he did
not fulfill in a prompt fashion. I
was truly privileged to have Dr.
Ryan as a professor and adviser.
Unfortunately, I cannot
make the same generalization
about the athletic department fac
ulty. There are many people in the
athletic department that I deeply
respect, both as coaches and as
people. But as a whole, I don't feel
the athletic department faculty has
treated me with the same respect,
courtesy, and good nature that I
strive to bestow on every person 1
meet. I am not writing this out of
bitterness, but instead am merely
addressing what I think is a prob
lem. That aside, I did have a very

positive athletic experience at
Gettysburg. Playing basketball al
lowed me to meet many good ath
letes and make many good friends.
I liked basketball before I came
here, but now I love it.
Working for The
Gettysbwgtan has been one of the
greatest experiences of my life.
When I came here I began writing
sports articles and eventually
wrote columns, in which I nor
mally entertained radical ideas. I
imagine that most people didn't
care what I wrote in those col
umns, but I do know some people

disagreed with a lot of my opin
ions. Since this is my final word, I
will address these people. Whether
you agree with my views or not,
remember that it is much easier to
agree with the mainstream and
their existing systems than it is to
develop and defend original ideas.
The Gettysburgian is often
understaffed and I think this is
somewhat of a travesty. By observ
ing the lather of one of my friends,
I learned that when something is
asked of you it should be your first
reaction to say "yes." However,
most people react with the oppo
site response. As a junior, I was

asked to become the sports editor
and I reluctantly agreed. I was al
ready busy and this meant I would
have even less free time. It proved
to be a lot of work, but I'm happy
that I did it. I was able to serve the
student body and got to know
many special people that I would
have otherwise never met.
In closing, there are several
people I'd like to acknowledge. I'd
like to publicly thank the man in
the admissions office (his name
escapes me) who helped get me
accepted. You took a gamble on me
and I'm happy you did.
Gettysburgian writers and
editors, it's been fun working with
you and you've all been extremely
helpful. Lauren, good luck next
year. Sprenkle, although you prob
ably won't read this, I'll be forever
grateful to you for helping me and
putting up with me when I first
started. Chesha, I've enjoyed
working with you this year. You
are an intelligent person and a very
good friend.
My roommates, for the
most part I've enjoyed living with
you. Everyone else who has been
special to me, I will acknowledge
you in person.

Impossible.
I have to sum up every
thing influential, important,
moving, funny and educational
that happened during my years
at Gettysburg? And I only get
about 600 words to do it?
I'll try.
My life didn't really be
gin until I got here. Sure I went
to high school and all of that
crap, but nothing that could

ever compare to the tipsy
turvyupside-down-whacked-out-helter-skelter
world of col
lege. First, I cannot possibly
touch on everything and every
one, and for that, I apologize.
But there is one person that I
must mention.
The first person I met at
Gettysburg College who I truly
called a friend was Casey

Dunn. Fiom the minute we
auditioned togethet for Roost
cis, she was looking out lor me.
I miss you, Casey. F,ven though
we didn't know each other foi
long, I'll never forget you. Be
cause of her I wound up here
at the paper with the best group
of friends I could ever imagine.
Speaking of those friends,
they're all wackos! And I
wouldn't have it any other way.
Movies, parties, Encore, Iron
Chef, APO, the extend-o-table,
all of the glorious arguments,
and so many other things
helped to keep me crazy in a
sane world no,
wait nevermind. That's
right. Barb, Becca, Jody, Carrie,
Damien, Brent, Tim, Jamie, the
other Tim, Melodie and all ol
the rest, how did you ever put
up with me?

I d really like to know.
My guess is alcohol and psy
chotropic drugs; regular air just
doesn't seem potent enough.
From the back of Servo (who
will inherit our place) to by-law
changes, we did it all.
Nothing will ever com
pare to the extreme levels of
insanity, hilarity and revolt that

has filled College Apartments
# 1. I apologize in advance to
whomsoever moves in next
year - the place is tainted (and
I'm not talking about the mys
tery stain in the downstairs
bathroom).
1 need to thank Tim,
Brent, and Jamie, you wicked,
evil people,for helping to in
sure that the bubble of indig
nity will never be broken. The
things that we have allowed,
and, sometimes, encouraged,
would boggle the mind of any
sane person. But that, also
means that the four of us un
derstand all of it with the ut
most clarity.
I'll miss you guys, and all
of the wacky goings-on.
Speaking of wacky (and
in no way representing goings
on), 1 also have to mention the
Getty sburgian.

I love the silly thing, what
more can I say! It made me feel
so wanted (except when Babbit
fired me for the 3,694th time),
work so hard (okay, so maybe
not), learn so much (who knew
Swedish fish were that fun),
realize the value of Wednesday
night sleep (ha!), and prove
that I can do anything I want
(really).

I really want to graduate
(and so far everything looks
promising - Hi Mom!). Five
years ago, I would never have
said that I could enjoy going to
school. Sure the socializing
was fun, but classes were a
pain. That changed when I got
here, too.
I cannot express my
thanks to my professors. I'm
sorry that I didn't get to know
some of you better. You don't
hear often enough how well
you do your jobs. The good
usually goes unspoken while
the bad gets blown out of pro
portion. Thank you all for be
ing strict, grading hard and
making sure that your students
learn. From Chemistry (shame
less plug!) to Religion, every
department I have sampled has
made me a little more round.

(Servo food doesn't hurt either
- oh look, fried fried)
About 600 words, who'd
have guessed.
To anyone looking for a
place to find yourself, check
here. Sure things get crazy, but
that's part of the challenge -
surviving the crazy'parts and
making them into the great sto
ries that you won't tell your
kids, someday.

Three years ago I was put
ting off studying by packing my
car so that I could drive home im
mediately after my last final,
never to return. I did return in
the fall, however, and since then,
I have never once regretted be
ing here.
Even back in my I-want-to
transfer days, The Gettysburgian
has always been an important
part of my college career. From
basking in the glow of my ten
seconds of fame every other week
when my features article would
appear on the front page of the
section, to hanging around the
office until 3:30 every Wednes
day even though I had work to
do for my 8:30 class because I
couldn't bear to miss a word of
what was said, to rushing in af
ter a ten hour workday to put
together a section as fast as pos
sible so I could go to bed before
another ten hour workday, I have
appreciated every second
(though sometimes only in hind¬

sight) of my association with the
paper. I will never forget the feel
ing of Thursday, knowing that I
helped create what everyone was
reading and discussing, and I al
ready miss actually being relieved
by saying "when the newspaper
is finished, tomorrow is Friday!"
Those were the days. As
two of the most amusing people
I have ever met used to say, "I
miss The Day." The history ma
jor in me will always pine for the
bygone Day of Sprenkle, Larkin,
Petro, Spanky Spice, Dairy Spice
and Pepper. I'll always remem
ber how it was in my day, when
we would be in the office until 3
or 4 because we spent so much
time talking and laughing, and
when we would all write the staff
ed together. "Are we for or
against campus violence?" "We
support dinosaur rights, right?"
To Danielle, Chesha, Bill,
and Nadine: it has been wonder
ful working with you, and your
influence has made working on

the paper enjoyable and much
more efficient. Dan, though my
ability to accomplish anything
drops to about zero when you are
in the office, I have really missed
your stories and ostriches and
imitations on Wednesday nights
this semester.
To Allison, Lauren, Kristen
and Andrea: good luck next year.
The paper rests entirely in your
hands. You have the _powei to
make it what you want and to
leave a lasting impiession on
those who come after you. Make
a good impression, and tor yeais
future editors will sit around the
office discussing back in the day
when you were in charge.
Though the Burgun did
contribute marketable skills to
my resume, there have been nu
merous other aspects of life _heie
at Gettysburg that 1 will treasure
forever. I would like to take this
last bit of space to thank the
people who have influenced me
most in the last three and a half
years. Dr. Commito and Dr.

Birknei, thank you for your sup
port and encouragement in all I
wanted to do. Dr. Bowman,
thank you for you for teaching
classes about the

things I really
wanted to know.
To the people
I don't see much
anymore- Sarah
and Sam: you made
heshman year bear
able, and 1 thank
you foi youi listen
ing eais and your
friendship;
Heather, Christina,
Laura, Sarah, Erin,
Jen, and Sean: your
friendship is the
reason 1 became
happy here. I will
never forget any of
you. Those 1 have
nor mentioned
heie, you know
who you are and
you know 1 love
you and value you

more than I can express here and
I will tell you so in person.
Dreams are for people with
futures!!

Abortion is
death
As I picked up the latest
copy of The Gettysburg
tan, I noticed there was
no "Feminist Front" article in
side. I have to admit, I was
pleased. This is not because I
do not like the writing style of
the author. It also does not
mean that I am opposed to
many feminist ideals. In fact, I
believe that it is a great injus
tice every time any person is
not treated equally. This is why
I cannot stand the constant bar
rage of pro-choice articles that
I find almost every week. I felt
that it was time that someone
with a pro-life stance took on
the task of examining the abor
tion debate.

First of all, abortion is
killing. This fact is not even
debatable. When the fetus is
terminated, a living creature is
destroyed. We are talking
about simple biology. How
ever, pro-choice advocates say
that women have the right to
KILL the unborn because it is
their body. I would like to ask
when this notion got intro
duced into American law. We
do not have the right to do
what we want to our bodies.
Drugs in all shapes and sizes
have been made illegal because
they have the capacity to kill
us. A pregnant woman who
drinks and smokes is consid
ered a negligent parent. So
even if we assume that the fe
tus is somehow a part of the
woman's body (even though it
has its own brain, heart, DNA,
etc..) we are limited in the ac
tions we can take with our own
body.

Since we should all accept
the scientific fact that abortion
is killing, how can we deter
mine that it is moral? Because
we have a separation of church
and state, it becomes ironically
more difficult to justify abor
tion. The concept of a soul or
divine spark is religious. No
secular government can accept
the theory of a soul. So where
can we draw a line that says
where a fetus becomes human?
The actual moment of birth is

just silly. The child is not bio
logically different in or out of
the womb. So, the infusion of
'human' on what pro-choice
advocates consider a clump of
cells must come somewhere
during the nine months of
pregnancy.
Scientifically, the fetus is
human during every stage of
development. He or she might
be younger than the rest of us,
but the child is still a human
being. Some would say that de
pendency on the mother clas
sifies a fetus as not human. He
or she would require the
mother to live. I've got a little
secret for you pro-choice femi
nists, a one, two, or three year
old is also dependent. If you
left a newborn to his or her
own devices, the child would
die within a matter of days, if
not hours.

I have also heard the ar
gument that the lives of both
the child and the mother would
be better off with an abortion.
This argument usually goes
along with the theory that these
aborted children would have
been born into poverty. What
is that saying about our society
if we say that a child is better
off dead than being unexpected
or born into a poor family?
Frankly, I do not think wealth
has anything to do with the
quality of one's life (after all,
suicide is far more common
with the upper-class). If you
are thinking that killing this
child would be easier for the
mother, that may be true.
However, that opinion could
never be universalized. My life
would be easier if I killed some
people. That does not mean I
have the right to do it. If I did,
I would go to jail.

Pro-life arguments are
not founded on universality.
Instead, they are merely grant
ing someone the right to kill
another. As I stated before, this
is biological fact. Lives should
not be terminated for conve
nience or to prevent hardship.
I feel we need to be much more
liberal with what we consider
a human life. However, it is
very easy to understand why
abortion is legal. Pro-choice

feminists vote and an unborn
baby cannot. If pro-choict
feminists are really looking roi
equality, they should set an ex
ample. This example can only
be set by respecting the unborn
and giving them all the rights
that a human being deserves.

Raising awareness,
not homelessness
In response to an article pub
hshed in last week's Gettys
_burgtan on the non-authen
tic qualities of the Cardboard
Village event, I see where the
author makes some very valid
and interesting points. How
ever, I also believe that as valid
as these points are, they over
look the true purpose and
meaning behind this event as a
part of Homelessness Aware¬

ness Week.
Each year, the Center for
Public Service sponsors the
Cardboard Village as one of the
key events behind
Homelessness Awareness
Week. Students from all over
campus gather to build
"homes" of cardboard boxes
and then agree to sleep out in
them overnight. The idea is
that students gain an apprecia
tion for what it is that a home
less person goes through on a
day-to-day basis.

Those who critique the
authenticity of the Cardboard
Village are completely justified
in doing so. It is true that many
students at a $31,000 a year
college have no real compre
hension of what homeless life
is like, and I too found, from
my experience sleeping out on
Stine Lake, that most people
took part in the event for the
excitement of having a big out
door sleepover with peers
rather than to simulate home
less life. Granted, had the
weather been cold or rainy,
there is no doubt in my mind
that participation would have
dropped significantly, had there
been any at all. And perhaps
the Servo-catered hot drinks
and the frisbees flying overhead
contributed to the author's dis
gust at how the event became
a joke.

However, the crucial
point that the author of this
commentary failed to make is
that the Center for Public Ser
vice WAS successful in its mis
sion. There is no intention in
this event to simulate homeless
life; we know that this is nei
ther practical nor realistic. If
we wanted to simulate home
less life, we would gather vol
unteers, drop them on a street
corner in D.C. and tell them
they'd be picked up again in the
morning. But who would par
ticipate in that? You can't bring
your frisbees to do that, or your
CD player, or your smores.
The fact is that many
people on this campus don't

stop to think about how good
we have it. The fact that we
are able to say we are cold and
walk home in the middle of the
night is a luxury that some
people do not have, though it
may seem like nothing big to
us. The purpose behind this
event is to raise awareness for
what homelessness is. Sure, it
can be argued that the event
was not even close to mirror
ing a homeless person's exist
ence, but the fact that someone
could participate in this event
and then write such a power
ful piece proves that awareness
was raised, and this is what
makes the Cardboard Village
successful.

To the author of last
week's opinion article, I praise
you for your comments. They
are truthful, inspiring and very
powerful. We only hope that
those people who agree with
this position can at least real
ize that the recognition of the
cardboard village as non-au
thentic means that your aware
ness for the issues surrounding
homelessness in the world have
been raised from this experi
ence. If you can make these
connections, that is all we were
hoping for. But to call the
Cardboard Village a disgrace
for its lack of authenticity is not
a valid point, as it completely
misses the purpose behind it.

Honor Comission
clarification
As finals week ap
proaches, the Honor
Commission would
like to remind the student body
and the faculty about a com
mon misconstruction of the
Honor Code that arises during
this test-taking time. Many be
lieve that, under the Honor
Code, students have the right
to take the exam wherever they
choose, since the examinations
are unproctored. This is false.
It is true that "the
faculty...shall refrain from
proctoring examinations" (Ar
ticle XI, Number 4). But it is
not true that students have the
choice to leave the classroom
and go some place else to take
their exams without the per
mission of their instructors.
The Honor Code states that
"under normal circumstances
students are expected to write

examinations in the room or
rooms specified by the instruc
tor, unless permission to work
elsewhere is requested by the
student(s) and granted by the
instructor" (Article XI, Num
ber 5).
Students accommodated
for learning disabilities should
speak with their individual in
structors well in advance of the
exam to make the necessary
arrangements. For other stu
dents who feel they need to
work somewhere else during
the exam, please contact your
professor to discuss this con
cern before the exam to see if
this would be acceptable and to
make appropriate arrange
ments.

We hope that this clarifi
cation will lessen the amount
of misunderstandings that oc
cur around exam time, espe
cially concerning this particu
lar point of the Honor Code.
If you have any questions or
concerns pertaining to this is
sue, please do not hesitate to
contact me.
Sincerely,
Christina Dickert
Honor Commission Chair

Racism: Right at
home in Gettysburg?
We tell ourselves that things have
changed. We tell ourselves that racism
doesn't occur. And if it does, we say,
well then it certainly doesn't happen
around people like us. People who go
to this nice expensive school. People
who should know better.
But what we've found out is that
it does happen. And it happens right
down the street. Our English 353 (Dis¬

courses of Resistance) class was pre
sented with a task. We had to resist
something, anything. It's tough to re
sist when people say that you go to one
of the most stuck-up schools in Penn
sylvania. People think that our biggest
problem is deciding what pair of shorts
to order from J-Crew. But we tried. We
started out big. We wanted to change
things on a national level. Then we
started to think about Gettysburg. We
decided to take a walk to the 7-11.
We'd heard rumors. They said
that the 7-11 employees had harassed
minority students. We decided to in
vestigate. We conducted interviews
with four different Gettysburg College
students who said that employees of the
7-11 harassed them. Here's what we
found:
"Get the hell out of here I don't
want you here!"
"Close the door. Who else is hold
ing the door open? What are you, stu
pid ?" "Which one of you said something
smart about cops? One of you said that
cops were pigs."
Clerks called the cops on two dif
ferent groups of African American stu
dents. Cops followed one student to
work. Clerks threatened to call the cops
on another student. Clerks refused to
touch an African American student's

hand when he offered them money.
Wow. We tell ourselves that these
vocalizations of hostility don't happen
in the year 2000. Obviously we're na¬

ive. As we dug deeper, we found out
more. In the past seven years, five dif
ferent court cases citing racism as their
cause have been filed against the 7-11
franchise. Employees sued because they
did not feel like they were being treated
fairly. The court ruled in favor of 7-11
four of these times. One of the deci
sions is still pending. Racism is some
thing that is embedded in the structure
of this corporation. And we know from
personal experience that this hatred is
being projected outward to its customer
base. We conducted several experi
ments in the 7-11 over a period of
weeks. We sent in different groups of
students of different ethnicities. We per
sonally did not experience any hostil
ity. But should our findings make us
feel secure? Should this satisfy us?
Should we now believe that racism is
NOT a problem?

No. We need to realize that there
are a variety of truths to be uncovered.
We uncovered one in our experiments.
But we can't be content to settle for this
one truth. We need to remember what
our sources said and create a new truth
that's not so optimistic. This new truth
needs to take into account what hap
pens when we're not looking.
So what's our purpose in telling
you all this bull****? We're disturbed
by what goes on in-the shadows. We
want you to be, too. And if you are,
then you need to ask yourself what you
can do to change it. We decided that
the first step would be to tell you. What
are you going to do now?
The English 353 Class

Consider This

Have you ever noticed that no matter how much any one person
tries to change or develop our campus community, for the most part
they are lost and their ideas forgotten? Maybe this is because of the
four-year turnover rate here at our college, but maybe it isn't.
It is our contention that such suffocation of free ideas, thoughts

and stop caring about whether capri pants are in this year. Why come
to college if not to expand your mind with different cultures and higher
education? It seems like a waste of your and/or your parents' money
to use these years for anything else.

and unrewarded work is a direct result of medi
ocrity and the general laziness of our campus
community. People often blame such things
on apathy, but apathy is not the correct word
Many people do care, and many try to change,
but the majority of people on this campus just
don't give a hoot for anyone else.
For example, the Bullet Hole is continu
ally trashed by the end of the day, not by people
who were raised in a barn, but by those who
have been so pampered and unappreciated in
their lives that they don't really care about any
one, even themselves. Another example is the
constant reference to people in our community
as "townies", when in reality, we live in the same
town for the majority of the year. This sounds a
bit stupid now doesn't it? Many people use such
a term in a derogatory manner to describe
people who come from a very different social
and economic background than they do. How
many wealthy Gettysburg residents are called
"townies"? I rest my case.

Too many people on our campus just don't
think to care, nor do they care to think, about
much of anything. This is due to the idea that
college is a time for beer drinking, hooking-up
and being loud and destructive. This is why so
many very talented people transfer; because
of a cultural stigma left over from the neaderthal
like 80s when the Greek system existed not so
much for brotherhood, but for kegs and eggs
and to feed the male libido.
After four years here, we are a bit tired of
a campus community that is not a forum for
higher learning, but a glorified prep-school with
a damn good faculty. People really need to grow
up, become a little more responsible and aware,

The end of cynicism

BY LA. lSHERWOOD
Columnist
It is almost over - the
whole damn thing. My tenure,
this campus community and all
of our time here. The last col
umn of bitching you will hear
from me, at least till I land a
good job, which at this time in
my life, seems like an impossi
bility. When I reflect on these
columns, I see a journal of my
college experience in its rela
tive totality. My griping, com
plaining, joy, sorrow, happi
ness, frustration, bitterness,
longing, homesickness and, in
deed, the best years I have had
thus far. For you, my faithful
readers, I have a long annotated
list of those who have given me
so much that has helped to
frame my life.

I will not waste time with
reminiscent descriptions of the
trees, or the painted grass of
Spring or any of those aestheti
cally pleasing sights we see on
a daily basis. What I have loved

on this campus, I have seen,
and appreciated, and have tried
to do my part to make better.
What I will not miss is solely
my business, as I have used
those things in previous works
to show my lasting frustration.
So I can only now thank those
who have made my life here
pleasurable from all directions:
whether they academic or so
cial. The right place to start
with these thanks is to my edi
tors who, for the past few years

of writing, have dealt with me
barging into their office and
demanding perfection. It was
three years ago exactly that I
wrote a lengthy letter to the
editor who got me a column in
this paper, and I thank Rebecca
Babbitt for the opportunity to
write my sophomore year. I
would like to thank Melodie
Foster for again offering me my
column after an expatriated
journey abroad. This column
has been my grace, my sanity
and my own form of art these
years, and I thank those at the

Gcttysburgian.
From an administrative;
standpoint, I would like to
thank Dean Ramsey for her
support over this last year and
for our conversations about
everything and nothing. Presi
dent Haaland, thanks for all the
"hi's" in passing as I sat on the
steps of the library. Most im
portantly, thanks to Margaret
Anne for all of the encourage
ment and good-natured tun
over these years.
The faculty has given me
the greatest inspiration that any

faculty could give (with a few
exceptions of course). First,
the history department in gen
eral have encouraged my love
for, their discipline since the
first day I set foot on this cam
pus, and I owe my education
to them. I thank Dr. Bowman
for being my friend and men
tor over these last few years and
for convincing me that this
place wasn't as bad as I thought
it to be. Dr. Birkner challenged
me, beat me down in seminar
and made me into a historian,
him for his warm
and l than

friendship and complete sup
port, tor which I am extremely
grateful. Also, Dr. "Buz"
Myers, for one of the best, most
inspirational and thought pro
voking classes of my four years
heie, which helped me to fur
ther understand my religion.
To all of my friends, ac
quaintances and those who I
really don't know but say "hi"
to, forgive me if I leave you out
of this next section. Jewett: my
closest friend and greatest chal
lenger, potato loving man that
you are - this one's on me &

Thunder Road. Thank you for
three great years in the sun and
one in the shade. Bayardi &
Vish - you guys make one great
Methodist and the best (and
strangest) friends a person
could ask for. Thanks for the
liver of a 50 + year old man &c
Thunder Road. Hutch - well
you're still getting paid by the
College so I'll refrain from my
comments, I'll see you at the
family restaurant later with
Thunder Road. Robertson, you
have been my mother and
friend for these last few years

Dean ^^^^^^^H
Dennis _^H _^H
Murphy and Grace
Meyers in Greek Life, who kept
me on my toes. I have become
a strong proponent of the
Greek system at this college, it
has taught me a lot and I am
convinced that it good for
young men and women. It is
too bad that sophomore rush
will be implemented, which
will most likely destroy some
of our houses, but the system
is a century's old institution
that should never die.
On the academic side, I
could not have been more
pleased with the professors that
I have had. From my freshman
seminar with Dr. Kenneth Mott
to my senior seminar with Dr.
Birkner, the history and politi
cal science departments have
- continued on page 16 -
see REFLECTION

and don't think for a second it
hasn't been appreciated along
with Thunder Road. Barnes -
for just being the diligent,
forthright and phenomenal
character that you are, in spite
of Thunder Road. For the
boys- one great trip and some
excellent hotel experiences
along the way, in addition to
the usual Thunder Road.
Laura, thanks for the gifts in
England and the warm friend
ship even though you hate
Thunder Road. Sammy Baby -
for simply saying yes to all of
my silly questions after singing
Thunder Road. Finally, Mr.

Ramius, I will see you in hell!
only if there is Thunder Road.
Most importantly for this
column, I thank each and ev
ery one of you who sat down
to even read one line of my
tripe. Without you all this
would not be possible, and I
thank you all for the years of
reading and negative, as well as
positive, responses. I especially
thank those who sought me out
over the years to tell me they
liked my work - it is you people
that keep me going and I hum
bly thank you. For those of you
who didn't - you fueled the
rage deep inside of me and
again, I thank you.

I hope that the under
classmen have enjoyed what I
have had to say for both the
good and the bad. I encourage
all of you to strive for excel
lence, seek out the good and
the beautiful in this world, and
for God's sake, be your own
person here. Things are so
much better than four years
ago, but the social climate still
needs a lot of work and it is up
to each and every one of you.
Remember, we are in an aca
demic culture and, as mature
adults, it is our duty to think,
express and learn from every
single life experience. Never
accept the mediocrity of daily
existence. I hope that when I
return, I am proud of what this
campus has become. Remem
ber, there is more to life than
pettiness and the overuse of the
term "like" on a daily basis.
There is for all of us - Thunder
Road!

A senior's reflection

by john dunlap
Political Columnist
Sitting in Servo during
what I believe was probably my
second week at Gettysburg
College, a member of The Get
tysburgian staff, who I could
not even name now, ap
proached me. Knowing my
interest in politics and where I
stood politically, I was asked if
I would write a weekly column
from a conservative Republican

perspective. I eagerly agreed,
and here I am, four years later,
still attacking President
Clinton, and from time-to
time, going off on right-wing
tangents.
Back in early 1996, when
I began writing for The Gettys
burgian, we were in the midst
of a general election campaign.
I had just returned from the
Republican National Conven
tion in San Diego and had
hopes, naive as they may have

been, that yes, the American
people would eventually get
excited about Bob Dole's pro
posed tax cuts and that a silent
majority, not counted by the
polls, would rise up against one
of the most corrupt administra
tions in history. As we all know,
that did not happen, but at least
I could take pleasure in the fact
that Bill Clinton only received
49% of the popular vote, not
an outright majority.
For my sake, it is prob
ably good that President
Clinton was reelected, if not,
what would I have complained
about for the past four years?
Anyway, I cannot complain, the
world seems to be turning more
conservative. Just last week,
Professor Michael Birkner

compared Ronald Reagan to
Andrew Jackson, and Dr.
Birkner spent the 1980s trash
ing President Reagan in news
paper editorials. Who knows,
hopefully someday the children
of Dr. Birkner will be compar¬

ing President Reagan to
Abraham Lincoln. You never
know.
Well, no matter who is in
Washington or on Wall Street,
I can say I am better off today
than I was four years ago, or at
least the last four years have
been a lot of fun. Freshman
year I was fortunate to become
friends with a lot of the people
I lived with on the third floor
of Hanson Hall, where we un
fairly made the RA, Wendy
Crocker's, life much more dif
ficult than it should have been.
I am still friends with many of
these same people I lived with
freshman year, in fact, five of
us still live together, now on the
second floor of Theta Chi.
It has been a pleasure be
ing part of Theta Chi Frater
nity where I have made so
many close friendships and
have had a great time. Serving
as IFC Treasurer was a great
experience, I came to like and
respect everyone I worked

Reflection

trom the lUmheij $ Mouth
The Columbine video: A piece of history or a national travesty?

by Christina Dickert
Political Columnist
I was going to write my
column about Elian Gonzalez
this week, but I figure that the
second largest news story in the
past ten years (yes, OJ received
even more coverage than the
kid from Cuba) has enough at
tention already. Instead, I am
going to use the last column of
my junior year to reflect on one
of the scariest events to happen
in the past calendar year.
It is almost hard to be¬

lieve, but the Columbine mas
sacre occurred over a year ago.
That fateful morning last April,
two students entered school
and never left, leaving a path
of devastation—12 students
murdered, 1 teacher killed, and
the two mentally ill who com
mitted this horrific crime com
mitted suicide. It is hard to be
lieve that such a thing could
ever happen in a suburb like
Littleton, Colorado. This is a
story that you would expect to
happen in New York or Los

continued from page 14

made me a better thinker,
writer, and even a better per¬

son. I have been taught by so
many great professors and a few
stand out and deserved to be
thanked, such as Dr. Birkner
and Dr. Mott, who amaze me
with their knowledge of Ameri
can political history. My advi
sor, Dr. Norman Forness, who
is retiring after a distinguished
career at Gettysburg, has been
an influence on me since my
first day of college. Dr. Bill
Bowman is one of the friendli
est people I have ever met. His
classes have always been inter
esting, as well as challenging
and Gettysburg College is lucky
to have him. Finally, I owe a
big thank you Dr. Shirley Ann
Warshaw. My courses with Dr.
Warshaw have been some of my
best and I have always enjoyed
being the Republican response
to her in class.
Beyond those professors
there have been so many people

Angeles, not in a quiet little
Denver suburb. But still it hap
pened, and it pulled at the
nation's emotions.
First, it touched our
hearts, with our sympathy go
ing out to the victims, their
parents, and the members of
the community who were di
rectly affected by this ordeal.
Secondly, it incited fear in the
hearts of every parent and stu
dent across the nation. Who
knew whose school would be
next? When parents drop their
kids off at school now, they

sometimes wonder if that will
be the last time they see them.
What has our nation come to?
I know my conservative
counterparts will automatically
point to the family structure
and how there must have been
some missing link in the
"moral" education of the chil
dren who kill other children.
In the Columbine case, I would
have to agree. What parent
does not notice that their child
is becoming more and more
withdrawn and obsessed with
death and murder? How could

at Gettysburg that have done a
lot for me. It was through this
college that I was able to get to
know Congressman Bill
Goodling, who has always gone
out of his way for Gettysburg.
He has eaten dinner at Theta
Chi, talked to Student Senate,
and spoken with our College
Republicans on numerous oc
casions. Congressman
Goodling is one public servant
that I have been honored to
support.
Lastly, I want to thank my
friends. I leave here very happy
and with no real regrets, and
there are so many things about
this place that I will never for
get. There are a lot of people,
faculty, administration, staff,
and students that have meant a
lot to me. I also know there
are many friends, including
Melissa Bryant and a lot of
Theta Chis that have always
been there for me that I will
maintain friendships with long
beyond Gettysburg.

you not notice that your child
is building a pipe bomb in his
or her bedroom? When the
police searched the Klebold
and Harris residences in
Littleton, they found evidence
of the duo's plans on top of
their dressers. It didn't seem
like the parents had to disturb
the child's privacy— it was out
in the open.
Many have wondered
that if the parents had realized
what their sons were planning,
maybe the whole massacre
could have been avoided. But
we could spend decades asking
"what if." The fact of the mat
ter is that even a year later, the

Columbine shootings are still
fresh in American's minds.
I am still in disbelief over
how school life has changed
over the past three years since
I've left high school. We ex
pect that our children are sate
at school, because it keeps them
off the streets, but somehow
that has all changed. This is the
moment where I usually start
my rant about gun-control, and
if Dylan Klebold and Eric Har
ris hadn't had access to those
guns, they wouldn't have been
able to cause the problems that
they have become notorious
for, etc. But I think that you've
heard that enough.

What has disgusted me
even more is the fact that the
Littleton Sheriff's Department,
in conjunction with the Fire
Department, has released a
video of the aftermath of the
shootings. In this video, the
viewer sees the library where
students were huddled, scared
to see their friends shot in front
of them and worried if they
were to be the next victims.
The viewer also sees the
cafeteria where Klebold and
Harris killed some other stu
dents. The blood and bullet
holes are evident in the images,
and little cards with the victims
names are placed near the spot
where they died. The video
also-shows the rescue teams
pulling out the dead and in
jured. It is a very grim video.
What was once a training
video has now become a docu¬

mentary. Background music
was added (including Sarah
McLachlan's "I Will Remember
You") to make it seem less gory.
The price of this video is $25.
Nobody knows or is willing to
admit where the profits of the
video are going.
Parents of the victims and
school officials are outraged
that this horrific incident is
now being commercialized.
What parent would like to
know that people across the
country own a video of the
murder of their son or daugh
ter? Sarah McLachlan has also
spoken out against the video
and has requested that her song
be removed from the video's
soundtrack. (It was removed
earlier this week.)

But the question that
sticks in my mind is, who
would really want a video of
such a sick and twisted massa
cre? Hard to believe but over
500 people do. The sheriff's
department sold 107 copies on
the first day the video was re
leased_, and by Friday of last
week, 462 other people had
ordered copies. Is this what
our nation is coming to? If I
live in a country where people
want to be able to own a piece
of a fellow citizen's suffering,
then I'm moving to Canada!
How commercialized can our
country become? Why don't
we make tapes of the Nazi
death camps available for pur
chase? Or how about taping
people who are executed on
death row? Why doesn't a pro
ducer jump on the drive-by
shooting market before some
one eke does?

Grief is a private thing.
Even though we all share in the
suffering that the Littleton
community feels, it is their hurt
and pain. The fact that some
one is trying to make a buck off
ot another's pain makes me
sick. Personally, 1 hope that the
victims' parents win their in
junction to stop the production
and selling of the video. Own
ing a part of our nation's his
tory is one thing, but taking it
to a sick and twisted extreme
is another.

United States. Secondly, I
would like to included a short
poem that is on the Statue of
Liberty:
"Give me your tired, your
poor,
Your huddled masses yearn
ing to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your
teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless,
tempest-tossed to me.
I lift my lamp beside the

Elian is one of the tired,
the poor, one of the huddled
masses yearning to breathe
free. Great nations take in
those seeking freedom, they do
not return them.

._trom the .feminist Iront
The Republican platform shaken

by Rachel Hanson
Columnist
In my final column of the
year, I would like to discuss an
issue that has been troubling
me for quite some time: the
contradicting policies and ideas
that conservatives have been
spouting for years and are ma
jor tenets of the Republican
Party. A great many of these in
consistencies deal with the Re
publican stance on access to
abortion. We all know that the
Republican Party is against re
productive choice, but other
policies that Republicans have
do not match their ultimate

goal—"saving the unborn."
Republicans want to see
that teen pregnancy and "ille
gitimacy" is reduced and they
think abortion should not be an
option, but they also think that
comprehensive sex education
should not be given in schools.
Republicans feel that young
people should not be educated
about sex and its possible con
sequences and they certainly do
not think that teens should
have access to birth control,
including condoms. How can
they possibly expect the inci
dence of unwanted pregnancy
and subsequent abortions to be
reduced while not educating
people about sex?

Republicans also think
women should carry pregnan
cies to full term even when a
woman knows that there is no
way that she can financially
handle having a child. Now,
the logical thing for Republi
cans to do would be to increase
social welfare spending so they
can help women care for chil
dren that otherwise would have
been aborted. However, this
is not the case. In fact, a re
cent study found that states
with the strictest anti-choice
laws spend the least amount of
money on needy children.
How can Republicans honestly
expect women not to have
abortions when they cannot
care for their children and they

know the government will not
help out?
Republicans think that
the antiquated provision in our
Constitution allowing citizens
to own guns should be upheld
in today's modern society.
However, because of overly
relaxed gun control laws, guns
are killing children on a daily
basis. So, while Republicans
want to criminalize abortion to
"save our children," they have
no problem with guns killing
the very children they fought
so hard to "save."

I also find Republican
policies on capital punishment
to be interesting. They use the
"sanctity of life" as a reason for
women to not be able to have
control over their own lives,
while at the same time engag
ing in government-sponsored
killings of our own citizens.
They are fighting so hard to
"protect" fetuses that cannot
live on their own, while at the
same time killing living and
breathing humans. I love how
they think they can choose
which people do and do not
deserve to live.

Also, Republicans claim
that it is the Democrats who
waste taxpayers' money
through government programs,
but it is the Republicans who
advocate a policy that is unnec
essarily spending a great deal
of money. It has been estimated
that the cost of one death pen
alty, from arrest to execution,
ranges from $1 to $3 million,
while those that are sentenced
to life imprisonment average
around $500,000 each, includ
ing all incarceration costs. Re
publicans are wasting tax
money by employing cruel
death penalty policies.
Finally, I would like to
discuss the incredibly contra
dictory Republican policies re
garding gays. First, to go back
to the issue of abortion, Repub
licans advocate women putting
their children up for adoption
rather than having abortions.
We need people to adopt all
these children, but they think
that one large group of
people—gays—should not be

able adopt. Why should gays
not be able to adopt childien?
They are caring people who
want to share their love with a
child and isn't that what adop
tion ts supposed to be all about?
Also, if abortion is made
illegal, as Republicans desire,
among the great increase in
numbers of babies needing
adoption will be more minor
ity babies, drug-addicted ba
bies, and HIV-infected babies.
Because of the way our society
is set up, it is mainly middle
class whites that adopt because
it is such an expensive process.
And since people usually pre
fer to adopt children that look
like them, minority and ill chil
dren are the hardest to find
adoptive parents for. So with
harsher abortion laws, where
are all these extra "undesir¬

able" babies going to go to?
You certainly are not going to
see white, middle- to upper
class Republicans bringing
them all home.
Finally, Republicans are
so concerned with increasing
our military strength and yet
they are terribly picky about
whom they think can serve.
They do not want women to be
in combat and they want gays
to deny who they are in order
to be in the military (and some
Republicans do not want them
in there at all). Do they really
think that women and gays can
not fight for our country as well
as a heterosexual male? Or is
it because they fear they will
have to make more changes in
our sexist, racist, and ho
mophobic military? If Repub
licans want to increase our mili
tary strength, they need to stop
being so damn choosy about
who is eligible to die for oin
country.

The Republican Party is
full of contradictions and it is
clear that they have no prob
lem with this as long as it keeps
them elected and furthers their
elitist policies. Everyone
should keep this in mind while
beginning to think about who
our next President will be and
what party will control the
Congress.

Coiumnisi
Before dawn on April 22
twenty heavily armed men
from the Immigration and
Natmalization service stormed
into the home of loyal, law
abiding American citizens
pointed a submachine gun at a
six year old boy and removed
him forcibly from the home.
This raid was not only illegal
and unconstitutional, but mor
ally wrong.
United States Immigra
tion law states that any Cuban
that the FEDERAL GOVERN
MENT finds at sea shall be re
turned immediately, however,
if they make it to shore they can
remain in the United States. A

fisherman found little Elian at
sea after his mother died to
bring him to treedom. The US
government did not get Elian
until AFTER he arrived on
shore, therefore, under the law,
he remains in the United States.
Also, the INS sent out a posi
tion paper after this occurred
saying that custody matters
concerning little Elian were in
the purview of the Florida state
courts, not the federal govern
ment. This changed of course
when the Clinton-Gore Admin
istration decided to use this
little boy as a political pawn in
their plan to try and build a
legacy by normalizing relations
with the tyrannical Communist
regime in Havana.

Also, a state court ruled
that Elian was to remain with
his Miami relatives until cus
tody and asylum were decided.
Of course, this would hurt the
Clinton-Gore administration's
plans, so they sent in twenty
armed men in the early morn
ing to steal him, violating the
Tenth Amendment as well as
the federal separation of pow
ers. More importantly, they
made a shambles of the Fourth
Amendment. They went in
with a search warrant, did not
make any attempt for a normal
entry, violating procedure as
well as abusing a search war-

from the Conservative Corner
The Department of
(In)justice strikes again

,
, iant. Upon storming the house,
they pioceeded to remove a
six-year-old boy. A search war
, rant gives the right to remove
i property, to remove a human
I being forcibly, even for his own
I good requires an arrest warrant
¦ under the fourth amendment.
, People are not property and
i should not be treated like prop
I erty. I'm sure those who have
I studied history, especially the
Civil War, are familiar with the
Fugitive Slave Law. For those

who are not, this was part of
the Compromise of 1850 that
required that law enforcement
officials from free states return
runaway slaves to slave states.
This was a very unpopular law
in the free states and many citi
zens and law enforcement of
ficials willfully violated the law
on moral grounds. This situa
tion is similar, except that the
federal government is breaking
the law to force a six-year-old
boy back to what is essentially
slavery in Cuba for petty and
incorrect political reasons.

One of the arguments
made by those who support
sending the freedom seeking
boy back to Cuba is that he
should be with his father. That
is all well and good, except in
Cuba he will not be with his
father. They will place him in
a commune at age ten, also they
will put him when he gets back
in "re-educatron facilities" to
undo all of the positive influ
ences freedom has had on him.
Remember, in a Communist
state there is no such thing as
parental rights. The Commu
nist Manifesto declares that the
family is the tool of the bour
geoisie and should be abol
ished. In Cuba, the state has
sole decision on the fate of the
children, and they can move
them all over the country at
will. In conclusion, I would
first like to again ask Elian's
father to ask for asylum in the

Gettysburg now has golf "fore" women

by Robin Roger
Staff Writer
Ever since Title IX, col
leges around the country have
attempted to provide equal
support for men's and women's
teams. However, some sports
have not been accessible to
both men and women. Along
with hockey and football, golf
proved a difficult sport for
women to break into. Most
recently, women have been
more and more accepted into
the professional arena of golf,
but there still exists a barrier
in college and high school ath
letics. Because of this obstacle,
students like sophomore Chris
tine Champey have had to
forge their own trails. Her ex
tensive efforts and undying en
thusiasm have resulted in a suc
cessful fledgling women's golf
program here at Gettysburg

College.
The team, which was cre
ated in the fall of 1999, now
consists of six members: Chris
tine Champey (Captain),
Kathryn Havens, Erin Hayden,
Allison Macholz, Kara
O'Donnell, and Molly
O'Keefe.
Together, the women had
an undefeated preseason, and
remained at the top of the heap
during their first official spring
season. They are hoping to
repeat their performance next
year, when they will have their
first official Conference Cham
pionships.
The original motivation
for starting a women's golf
team came from the disparity
of men's and women's golf.
Champey made the men's team
in the fall of her freshman year,
but found it difficult compet
ing against only men.

"It was a great experience
but competing against 80 other

men can
unfair," she said.
Champey thought it
would be a good opportunm
for her and other female stu
dents to have a women's
league.
Because of Champey's
interest, she met with the Ath
letic Director, Chuck Winters,
and her coaches, Casey
Counseller and George Petne.
At this meeting she was asked
to help establish the first Get
tysburg College women's
NCAA golf team.
Founding a team was not
an entirely new experience tor
Champey. She has some expe
rience, seeing as she helped es
tablish the first girls golf league
in Long Island. In high school,
Champey had the similar prob
lem of lack of opportunities.

She played on the Boy's
Junior Varsity Golf team at
Smithtown High School in
New York her junior year, be¬

cause there was no girls' team.
'The biggest challenge I
laced during that tune was how
to go about earning respect and
acceptance from the boys on
the team," she explained.
It was not easy for her to
break tradition.
Champey's break to
stand out came when she was
given the chance to play against
just females near the end of her
season at the Third Annual Suf
folk County Girls Golf Coaches
Association Tournament. She
was already a member of the
Junior Metropolitan PGA Tour,
which led her to realize that
theie were several other active
female members throughout
Long Island.
Due to this shared enthu
siasm roi a sport which was
restrictive for females, she de
cided to start an association. In
the fall of 1997, Champey be
came the Captain and Founder
of the first Girl's Varsity Golf

team on Long Island.
Just three years later,
many high schools now have
girls' varsity
golf teams, and Long Is
land has an official Girls' Golf
League. Champey's
efforts most definitely
contributed to the success of
women's golf's
breakthrough in New
York high schools.
Hopefully, as more op
portunities arise for women's
golf, more women will be in
terested in participating. There
is still more room for
Gettysburg's team to expand
and grow in strength.

Hazzard works
double duty, Bullets
split with WMd

from Gettysburg Sports

Releasl
Senior Melissa Hazzard
pitched all 14 innings for Get
tysburg, including an eight-hit
shutout in game two as the
Bullets split a doubleheader
with Western Maryland in their
Centennial Conference sottball
finale on Satuiday.
In game one, the Green
Terror plated the only run of
the game in the seventh inning
for a 1-0 decision. Gettysburg
answered with a 2-0 victory in
the second game keyed by RBI
from Mandy Wilson and Stef
Mastropaolo.
Hazzard allowed six hits
in the opener while striking out
five against no w.ilks in the
hard-luck loss. Western
Maryland's A m a n d a
Donaldson tossed a five-hit
shutout and picked up the vic
tory when Katie Swierkos
doubled home Chnsta Farrar
with the only run of the game

with one out in the bottom of
the seventh inning.
In game two, Hazzard
outdueled Leah Clelland to
notch her fifth win of the sea
son, striking out four more
while scattering eight hits.
Gettysburg jumped on
top in the first inning when Jen
White singled and came around
to score on a sacrifice fly from
Wilson. The Bullets added an
insurance run in the fourth
when Karyn Miller cracked the
first of her two doubles and
scored on a two-out single by
Mastropaolo.
Hazzard worked out of a
bases-loaded jam in the fifth
inning to maintain the shutout
and closed out the gem by fan
ning Candi Kuligowski on a
called third strike.
Jenna Pabst collected two
of Gettysburg's five hits in the
opener. The Bullets wrapped
up their regular season with a
20-5 overall record and an 11-

5 mark in the Centennial Con
ference.

Baseball pushes winning streak to five

from Gettysburg Sports
Release
Chris Lunardi went 2-for
3 with two RBI and scored the
go-ahead run on a delayed steal
as Gettysburg rapped out 16
hits en route to a 12-9 win over
Frostburg St. in non-confer
ence baseball action on Mon
day. Greg Kosc, John Woods
and Jorge Vitona all collected
two hits and two RBI to help
the Bullets win for the sixth
time in their last seven games.
Gettysburg batting leader
Kevin Grimm extended his hit
ting streak to 11 games with a
pair of hits while Pat Jordan
worked 4-1/3 innings of relief
to notch his first victory of the

season.
After watching Frostburg
St. erase an early 4-1 deficit and
take a 6-5 lead, Gettyburg went
on top for good with a pair of
runs in the fourth inning with
out the benefit of a base hit.
Jim Nastasi led off the
frame by reaching first base on
a third-strike passed ball and
moving to third on a stolen

base and a fly out from Kosc.
Lunardi drew a walk and
Grimm reached on an error to
load the bases with one out.
Woods followed with a
sacrifice fly that plated Nastasi
to tie the game at 6-6. With
runners on the corners and two
outs, Lunardi swiped home on
a delayed steal, scoring before
Grimm was tagged for the fi
nal out of the inning.
Gettysburg made it 8-6 in
the fifth inning on a two-out
RBI double by Dan Fuchs and
took a three-run lead in the
sixth when Lunardi again drew
a walk and came around to
score on a wild pitch.
Frostburg St. rallied for
two runs in the seventh to pull
within 9-8. Gettysburg put the
game out of reach with a three
run burst in the eighth, keyed
by back-to-back run-scoring
triples from Lunardi and
Grimm and an RBI single from
Woods.

The Bobcats rallied for a
run in the ninth, but Gettys
burg closer Matt Donohue re
corded a strike out with the
bases loaded to preserve the
win and notch his team-best
third save of the season.

Jack Tanner and Brett
Thorp also collected a pair of
hits for the Bullets on the af
ternoon. Gettysburg's 16-hit
outburst was its best perfor
mance since collecting 18 hits
in an 18-2 win over
Muhlenbergon March 25.
On Tuesday, junior Tom
Boob struck out seven in four
innings of relief and four Bul
lets drove in two runs apiece
as Gettysburg erased an early
9-4 deficit and came back to
beat Albright 13-12 in non
conference baseball action.
Lunardi, Thorp, Vitona
and Jeff Ebert all collected two
RBI to help the Bullets win for
the firth straight game and sev
enth time in their last eight.
Jack Tanner went 3-for-4
with three runs scored as Get
tysburg reached double digits
in runs and hits for the second
straight day, following a 12-9
win over Frostburg St. on Mon
day.

The Lions jumped out to
a 9-4 lead after the first row
innings, but the Bullets re
sponded with six runs in the
fifth inning and one in the sixth
to take an 11-9 advantage.
Albright tied the game

Junior pitcher Pat Jordan fires one towards a Gettysburg
opponent.

with a pair of runs in its half of
the sixth, but the Bullets an
sweied with a run in the sev
enth to take the lead for good.
Boob - normally
Gettysburg's No. 2 starter -
came on in relief and held the
Lions to a run on two hits while
fanning seven over the final
four innings. Boob improved

to 5-1 on 'the season, winning
for the second time in the last
five days.
Greg Kosc tripled for
Gettysburg's only extra-base
hit of the game.

first half, with the Bullets trail

what it took in the second half
to bury the Fords.
The tides turned early in
the second half, when Bucha hit
the net off of a pass from
midfield attacker Susie
Mitchell. After four minutes of
intense offensive movement,
freshman Erin Pate stopped an
offensive breakaway by
Haverford on a turnover.
Stambaugh was next to
sneak one by Haverford's
goalie followed by Seedorf and
Bucha.
Gettysburg made it 13-11
with a feed to Haugen from

After Michele stuffed the
first Haverford move to goal in
the second half, Haugen
capped the Bullets six goal
streak.

The Lady Bullets took
this game 15-13 with brilliant

Men's Lacrosse wins third straight CC title

by Erik Bullwinkel
Staff Writer

The Gettysburg
men's lacrosse team
closed out the Centennial
Conference season with ,
two wins, and their third i
consecutive conference
title. The Bullets easily j
defeated Swarthmore and i
Franklin & Marshall and ' .
now have their sight set j
on the NCAA tourna-,
ment. The Bullets quali- \
fied for an automatic "
berth after winning the 1
Centennial Conference '
title. I
Over the easterj
break, Gettysburg de
feated Swarthmore with:
ease, 23-7. Swarthmore I
took the early lead, 2-0, j
as Patrick Fnel scored two
goals on the first two
shots of the game. The ]
Bullets then went on a 12
1 run to post a halftime
score of 12-3, and never

trailed again.
The team posted a similar offen
sive attack that they have in previous
games. The Bullets outshot the Garnet
Tide 52-17 to set the tone for the game.
Four players notched hat tricks during
the game.
Those responsible were junior
Tommy Pearce, and sophomores Ric
Bremer, Wes Cadman, and Pete
Milliman. Seniors Ross Garretson and

Kevin Callahan each contributed a pair
of goals.
Senior Andrew Barter and junior
Eric Gregg each had three saves in the
net. Gregg spent eleven minutes in the
cage for the Bullets and kept the Gar
net Tide scoreless during that time.
This past Saturday, in their final
Centennial Conference outing, the Bul
lets defeated Franklin & Marshall in

Lancaster. The Bullets led the
entire game and posted another
impressive offensive attack.
The Diplomats kept it competi
tive in the first half, but the Bul
lets proved to be too much and
pulled away in the second half.
The offensive arsenal of Gettys
burg was aided by edges in
shots, 49-28, and ground balls,
44-26.
The offensive attack was
led by sophomore attack man
Pete Milliman. Milliman had a
day of career highs, scoring six
goals and a total of ten points.
Garretson had a hat trick, while
Pearce and senior Mark Pollak
also had a pair of goals each.
Barter guarded the net fro 58
minutes and tallied nine saves.
Yesterday Gettysburg de
feated Messiah, 16-5.

Goalie Andrew Barter
scored his first collegiate goal
in an end-to-end run. Milliman
scored six goals and had two
assists, while Bremer scored
four goals.
The Bullets are now 13-1
and ranked third in the nation.
They are awaiting their NCAA
assignment.

Last week proved to be the turn
ing point for the Gettysburg Women's
Lacrosse team, as they changed from the
team to watch to the team to beat.
The Lady Bulletes have found
themselves on an incredible climb this
season, which is sure to take them
straight to an NCAA championship.
On Wednesday of last week, Get
tysburg faced conference rival F&cM on
Memorial Field. In the first minute and
a half, the Bullets were trailing 20, how
ever in the next six minutes of the game
they rallied for five goals and a control
of the game they would never give up.
Freshman Katie Mernken started
the scoring followed by a goal by at¬

tacker Becky Bucha with an assist from
senior Amy Stambaugh. Anna Haugen

Seedorf, Stambaugh, and freshman
Megan Murphy continued the Bullets
relentless attack. The score at halftime
stood at 12-3.
In the second half goalie Michele
Centrella saw a little action by the F&M
attack, however not enough to even
come close to settling the score. Get
tysburg owned this game 16-7. With
this win, the Bullets clenched at least a
share of the Conference title.

ence game, the Bullets traveled to
