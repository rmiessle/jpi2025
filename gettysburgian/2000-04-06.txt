Rinehart reading
"A Kick in the Head"

By Jonathan Drayi r
Contributing Wwti r
A toga party at a frater
nity house, a few drinks at the
bar, or maybe recovering from
a rough Thursday night - the
average Friday night for the
students of Gettysburg Col
lege. For two hours last Friday
night, about 30 students and
faculty members listened to
Steven Rinehart read from his

most recent collection of short
stories, "A Kick in the Head."
Rinehart also discussed his
career with aspiring student
writers.
Rinehart recalled that
his love for writing began in
elementary school.
"I think I discovered that
I liked writing in fifth grade,"
said Rinehart. "I had a
teacher who had me write a
play. I just remember having

fun being cieative."
Howevei, in high
school he devoted little atten
tion to writing, and declaied
Chemical F.ngineenng as his
major at the University ot
Hawaii.
Midway through his
freshman year, academic
problems spurred him to
change his majoi.
Rinehart said his love
tor writing had not dimin
ished _M all, and he dedicated
the rest of his college careei
to becoming a writei.
While in school,
Rinehart wrote short stones
and worked tor various
schoolrelated publications.

He attended Iowa State
University's graduate school
and, over the last ten years,
has had his work published in
many journals and magazines
including Harper's, GO,
Story, Ploughshares, Georgia
Review and KGB Bar Reader.

Although Rinehart has
protited horn his writing, he
has not made writing his ca
reer. He has spent the last
seven years working tor a
computer company, and spent
time teaching at New York
University. He says he would
like to spend more time on his
wilting but leahzes the pres
sures in becoming a career
writer.
"I know a lot of people
who have made writing a ca
teer, and sit in front of blank
screens all i\Ay."
Rinehart said that not
having to worry about money
allows him to be more cre
ative. "I don't have the same
wonies as other writers be¬

cause my only source
ot income, so I have no pres
sure when I write."
Rinehart is working on
his novel. He says he plans to
return to teaching soon.

The changing face of college

By Kaiii Boo hi
CoNIUIBUIINd WUIII l<
Over a period of H years,
U.S. college students have
tended to study less, oversleep
more, miss more classes and
suffer greater stress levels, ac
cording to Higher Education
Research Institute.
"I think there is a ten
dency for _disengagement in stu
dent activities," said Alexander
Astin, director or the institute
at UCLA, to Gettysburg stu
dents. Astm spoke on campus,
returning to his alma mater.
Each fall Astm suiveys
about 350,000 freshmen at 700
American colleges and univer
sities. The first-year students
are asked to answer 200 ques
tions concerning their values,
beliefs, demographics, families
and social lives.

Astm said the common
goal among students today is
to earn money, unlike the com
mon goal •>() \eais ago, which
was to find a meaningful phi
losophy in lite.
Astm attributes the
change of goals to the influence
of television because "it makes
students less reflective."
Astm said he works to
create solutions regarding the
students' declining interest in
academic involvement. As a
professor, he encourages stu
dents to absorb his lecture au
dibly, instead of by taking
notes. Doing this makes stu
dents responsible for their own
learning.
Astm said the key to a
school's excellence is student
involvement in activities that
increase student-faculty and
faculty-student contact.

"Interacting with peers
enhances the learning experi¬

ence," Astin said.
Collaborative projects
increase student interest level
and make assignments more
desirable. He also suggested
that service learning projects
are a positive activity to in
crease student development.
Astin wants schools to
utilize the power of the peer
group, which serves as a pow
erful tool for student develop
ment. A follow-up survey was
issued to a group of students a
decade after their initial survey.
The college students placed
emphasis on the tools for stu
dent development, such as ser
vice learning, independent
studies, writing, ethnic diver
sity and common require¬

.
Ten years later, they took
active roles in their community
Most went to graduate school
and volunteered.

Homelessness and Hunger
Awareness Week 2000

By Candice J. Joseph
Contributing Writer
Worldwide, about 24,000 people
die every day from hunger or hunger
related causes. This number has de
creased from 35,000 ten years ago,
and 41,000 twenty years ago. During
the past year, over 2 million homeless
men, women, and children lived in the
United States alone . The task of end
ing homelessness and hunger however,
is far from being over.
Here on campus, many organi¬

zations are helping to spread
understanding of these is
sues by participating in
Homelessness and Hunger
Awareness Week from April
3rd to April 6th. The Cen
ter for Public Service, along
with Habitat for Humanity
and Alpha Phi Omega are
just a few of the organiza
tions contributing their
members and their energies
to help make this week a
success.
Through the program
ming scheduled for this
week, Gettysburg's students
will get a first hand look at
hunger and homelessness,
and hopefully they will be
come more perceptive and
sympathetic to issues around
them.

Hosted by Habitat for Human
ity, one of the Homelessness Aware
ness events taking place this week is
the Cardboard Village on Stine Lake.
Members of various campus organi
zations will spend the night outdoors,
sleeping in homes that they will build
out of cardboard boxes. Each organi
zation will raise pledge money to sleep
in their outdoor homes for the night.
This money will be collected, and
the group that raises the most money
will be given half of the sum, which
they can use for charitable causes and
for the aid of the organization. In do
ing this, students who sleep in the
cardboard village will experience the
reality of poverty, particularly
homelessness, and what it is like to live

without a roof over one's head.
Other events aimed at spreading
awareness on homelessness are the
Faces of the Homeless Panel in the
Junction, and the DC Outfitters trip.
At Tuesday night's Faces of the
Homeless Panel, the audience had an
opportunity to meet and talk with in
dividuals who have been, or who are
homeless. The Panel shared their sto
nes that led to discussion and reflec
tion on the causes and possible solu
tions to the problem of homelessness.
On the DC outfitters trip, stu
dents will travel to Washington DC to

distribute clothing to the homeless
peoples on the streets of our nation's
capitol. In both instances, students will
get a view of homelessness that is up
close and personal.
In recognition of the Hunger
component of this week's program
ming, a Hunger Banquet was held in
the Junction this Wednesday at 5p.m.
The banquet was a simulation of hun
ger throughout the world. Participants
in this event were divided into social
classes according to the first, second,
or third world countries they were des
ignated to represent. The candidates
were then served various meals that de
picted the types of meals they would
eat in their respective countries. Fol
lowing the banquet, those that took
part in the meals discussed and re
flected on how they would cope with

those _cucunistances day after clay.
During the Hunger Banquet, stu
dent Satwa Huq, Program Coordina
tor of Hunger and Nutrition at the
Center for Public Service gave a pre
sentation on some recent actions in the
battle against hunger. Specifically,
Huq' s presentation discussed the
Senate's budget resolution on the Hun
ger Relief Act.
Huq said "the Senate began de
bate on the Budget Resolution on April
4th, 2000. We expect that an amend
ment in support of The Hunger Relief
Act funding will be offered on Thurs¬

day, April 6th, 2000. The form of the
proposal is still unclear, but this floor
vote is crucial in showing support for
the bill." Huq added, "the Hunger
Relief Act, erected in 1805, is an inte
gral parr of working to end hunger. It
aims to reduce hunger in the United
Sates, especially among working
people and their families by strength
ening the Food Stamp program and as
sisting food banks in acquiring food. "
On Wednesday, April 05th, Satwa
called Senator Rick Santorum to urge
him to support the Hunger Relief Act
during the Senate's Budget Resolution
debate. To aid in this effort, we all can
do our parts by participating in
Homelessness and Hunger Week 2000.
At noontime on Tuesday, Eleanor
Pella presented "Meals without Meat
& Niitrmnrul Fncts." an informational

session on how to prepare delicious
meatless meals . Pella also addressed
nutrition in a college setting.
Some of the other weeklong
events that are available everyday are
a food drive, a toiletry drive, an infor
mation tale at the CUB, and an art con
test. For the food drive, cans collected
from students will be donated to the
local food pantry and soup kitchen.
The last day to donate food to help
others is Friday. Look for donation
boxes in Residence Halls and in the
CUB for the toiletry drive. Students
may also donate items

I such as toothpaste, tooth
brushes, soaps, deodor
ants, shaving items etc.,
to be given out to the
homeless in Gettysburg
and Washington DC.
I All this week in the
I CUB, students can see the
I Images of Homelessness
art displays by elemen
tary school students in
Gettysburg. Also, stop by
the CUB information
tables to talk, learn and
share thoughts on
[ Homelessness and Hun
ger. This Sunday, April
9th at 2 p.m., is the an
nual Crop Walk spon
the Awareness Committee

sored by
and Phi Sigma Kappa Fraternity. Do
nations for this walk will be collected
all this week in the CUB. A national
event, the Crop Walk was created by
the World Church Organization to
raise money for homeless people and
provide monetary support for the
poor. Please help the needy people by
pledging money to this cause, and by
participating in either the 3 or 6-mile
walk. When Homelessness and Hunger
Awareness Week 2000 comes to its
end, let's not forget what we learned
from this week's events. We should
continue (on our own time) to lend a
hand in the worldwide effort to ex
punge hunger and homelessness from
our communities and more so, our na
tion.

Drum roll please... Let me
introduce you to Andy
Stochansky. Andy released his
independent debut CD, While
You Slept, in 1995. It gathered
rave reviews.
Exclaim Magazine's take
on the CD: "I fell instantly in
love with this album - the kind
of love that only comes with the
realization that you are going to
hear this a hundred thousand
times, that this album is going
to be part of your musical jour
ney for the rest of your life."
The New Hampshire's definitive
description that the CD "is a
phenomenally ornate, yet sim
ply elegant musical journey
through the emotional connec
tion one has to themselves, oth-

eis and the
u n i v e i s e ".
And this was
in his oft
time from
t o u ring
around the
world with
Am. Now
focusing on
work as the
t r o n t m a n
and lead vo
calist of his
own band,
A n d )
Stochansky

e m e g e s
with his
sophomoie CD, Radio Fusehox.
Fiom his Terra Cotta, Ontario,
home/studio, he masterfully cre
ated a hybrid of electronic and
acoustic sound, then polished it
)ff with his signature style of per
mission.
He prepares listeners best

>ic that could be performed on
icoustic instruments, or dis
lorted tape, or both. The rock
thing either bores me or I just
don't do it well - so I'd rather
leave it to some other band. It
might be the music I enjoy hs
rening to, but it's not something
:hat I'm really interested in when
t comes to making my own mu

Listen to the nine tracks
hat comprise the CD: "Fly,"
Poem For a Small Boy on an

Amtiack Train," "Insect," "She
Detuned The Orchestra and
Left," "Lake Alaska 4:00am,"
"Song For You," "Talk," "Ar
rest," and "She Sang." You'll
realize that the journey motif
of While You Slept, remains
strong as the foundation of this
new release.
The live show empha
sizes Andy's vocals and high
lights his percussional roots.

Cage captures readers

by AnneSciilnck
Book Reviewer
Jennings Michael Burch.
They Cage the Animals at
Night. New York: Penguin
Putnam Inc., 1984. 293 pp.
This week's selection,
They Cage the Animals at Night
by Jennings Michael Burch,
was recommended to me by
Chesha Miller, esteemed spoils
editor of The Celtyshmgian..
Having read it _> e<ns ago, the
book left such an impression on
her that she thought it would
provide me with an interesting
read. After a little persuading,
I picked up a copy at Border's
only to find out that it's an
other tear-jerker of an autobi
ography: the fourth I've read

this semester.
This time, the story takes

place right in New York City and
traces almost four years m the
life of Jennings Burch. At age
eight, Burch spends the first of
many nights in an orphanage af
ter his mother became too sick
to care for him. Flung so sud¬

denly into the world of in
stitutions and foster homes,
Jennings does not yet know
the rules of this new world.
Because the future of
an orphan is too unknown,
friendships are forbidden,
and numbers replace names.
Jennings is forced to endure
the unfortunate world of fos
ter homes and splits his luck
between abusive foster par
ents and generous, loving
families.
Although he never
spends more than a few
months in any one institution
before returning home,
home is never the same
again. Fear of abandonment
and uncertainty about love
and trust dominate Jennings'
thoughts.

Tax attacks,

Dear Libby,
Where are the tax forms?
Late Filer
Dear Late,
Don't panic. Pennsylva
nia and federal tax forms are
available from the library's web
page located in the section
"How Do I Find." You can also
get federal forms by doing a
MUSCAT title search for 'tax
forms', and then clicking on the
link: View IRS Forms and Pub
lications page of Digital Daily

There is also a link to State
forms from Digital Daily.
Dear Libby,
I think we need more bi
ology books putchased for the
library. Although the best way
to find the most recent infor
mation is always journal ar
ticles, it helps to have some
good reference books available.
I went to look up some specific
information for a physiology
paper and found fewer than
five physiology texts which
were more recent than the

1970s or early 1980s. I was
disappointed in the lack of re
cent biology reference materi
als when I see so many new
books for the social sciences.
Sincerely,
Linda Moses
Dear Linda,
You're not kidding. Piti
ful, really pitiful! Libby sees
from CNAV that you are en
rolled in Animal Physiology
t-ibby looked for an updated
animal physiology book and
couldn't find one! The 1987
Facts on File publication is the
most recent. Libby will talk to
the faculty who make the book
recommendations in biology
and see if we can update this
part of the collection. We ap
preciate that you took the time
to let us know about the prob
lem.
Dear Libby,
I was just eating a sub on

the fourth floor, last carrel. I
wasn't bothering anyone. One
of the librarians told me to
take the food out. I don't ap
preciate that.
Eat When I Feel Like It
Dear Eat and Feel,
Sorry pal. Libby isn't a
bit sympathetic. In case you
haven't noticed, this is a pretty
flexible library. People don't
run around telling you to
shhhh or do your work or get
serious. Nobody yells at you
when you run up double digit
fines or rearrange the furniture
to have an informal study ses
sion on the main floor. The
librarians go out of their way
to be helpful. We're open 24
hours a day.

The place is ooozing
with user-friendliness, except
in one category: Food and
drink. We have lost too many
books and had too many key
boards ruined because of care
less beverage consumption.
That's why we want you to
bring your drinks in a closed
container and eat outside.
Take a look at the beau
tifully restored painting on the
second floor, with the soda
splashes all over the brand new
finish, where some genius
opened his coke. Not a pretty
picture.
Food attracts insects and
rodents. Both species enjoy
dining on the collection. If
you'd like to see a book that a
mouse got to before you had a
chance to read it, give Libby a
call.

Hearts to the reference
librarians who responded to a
flood of student requests for
personal research assistance,
by adding many additional
RPC slots over the next few
weeks.
Hearts to the gracious

students who take the time to
say thank you for assistance.
Everyone appreciates a kind
word once in awhile. Said one
of the librarians, "I had a hand
written thank you card in my
mailbox from a student I gave
an RPC to last week. Made mv
day!" Hearts to Pastor Frederick
Weiser, Gettysburg College
graduate, 1957, for the gener
ous loan of some of the most
stunning pieces in his folk art
collection. Pastor Weiser'has
been actively collecting carved
wooden miniatures from the
Erzgebirge (Ore Mountain)
area of the formei German
Democratic Republic. Some or
these pieces are currently on
display in Musselman Library.
Stay tuned for Libby's article on
this topic next week.

Extra hearts to the incred
ibly wonderful Housekeeping
staff for taking extra care to
keep Musselman Library clean

thought it was wise to visit a

establishment that is close
enough for most students to
consider dining there. I must
say I was sorely disappointed
with my choice of restaurants.
One may wonder what a

guy with the last name of Kane
could possibly know about Ital

a small part of the Kane family
lore. My great-grandfather im

It is hard to be critical of a story like They Cage the Animals
al Night. It is, after all, the story of a life I am thankful not to
have lived with an ending that even the movies could not have
made better. However, as a literary work and autobiography, it
lacks the sincerity that one would expect. The humor, fresh at
the start, becomes repetitive as the story progresses, and the emo
tion, although there, is frequently buried in clichEs.
liurch bounces among lecturing the reader on life, love,
and brotherhood, and the simplistic, immature voice of an eight
yen old. Sadly, with each bounce, the story seems to lose a little
of the genuineness that might have made it a bestseller. They

suited to an Italian restaurant.
Prints of old stone farmhouses
have their place, but not in a
restaurant that claims to serve
Sicilian specialties. I neither
require, nor necessarily wish, to
hear Dean Martin while I'm
eating my food, but an Italian
restaurant should not feel like
Aunt Bea's Country
Chuckwagon.
For my appetizers, I
chose two Italian specialties
with which I am well ac
quainted. I decided upon the
fried calaman and, of course

an antipasto.
The calamari was the
worst I have ever had. When
our waitress brought the appe
tizer to my table, it looked like
a basket of onion rings with a
bright red, poorly spiced
marinara sauce for dipping. I
understand that many restau
rants that are not close to a
body of salt water order pre
made frozen calamari, but
Buona Fortuna must have
bought the cheapest calamari
on the market. The calamari
itself was extremely tough and

rubbery and had no taste other
than that of the breading.
The antipasto had some
redeeming qualities, but for the
most part was third-rate. The
dish came to my table beauti
fully presented, so I thought I
was in for a treat. However,
the cold cuts and cheese were
of a poor quality, and the moz
zarella slice was not as rich and
creamy in flavor as in most res
taurants. The mushrooms and
artichokes were pretty good,
but these are merely accompa
niments to the items above.
One positive point to the anti
pasto was that the anchovies
were served on the side. The
dish was drizzled with a liberal
dose of olive oil, but even that
could not save it.

Upon scanning the menu
for entrees, I was impressed by
the variety of dishes that Buona
Fortuna served. However, a
closer inspection revealed that
a dinner salad and garlic bread
would cost extra, and there
were no free refills on soft
drinks, not even iced tea; this
negated my first reaction that

continued from page S
the entrees were reasonably
priced.
I decided to sample two
entrees, the Spaghetti
Carbonara that 1 am familiar
with, and the daily special. I
do not remember the name ol
the special, and I think the lapse
in my memory is a testament
to the entree's quality. It con
sisted of clams and rotini pasta
with broccoli, celery, and spin
ach. These were tossed with a
white cream sauce, covered in

mozzarella cheese, and then
baked.
Out of politeness to you
wonderful readers, I will re
frain from going into great de
tail over this dish. 1 would just
like to say that it tasted much
like the microwave dinners that
I buy for $1.25. I ate less than
half of the plate in front of me,
and out of respect for my dear
aunt Tessie, may God rest her
soul, I did not give an affirma
tive response to the waitress's
query as to whether or not I
desired a doggie bag.
My second entree choice
was the Spaghetti Carbonara.

This is one of my favorite Ital
ian meals. A large bed of pasta,
rich with an egg yolk thickened
cream sauce, and tossed with
bacon and onions, is truly a glo
rious thing to behold. Again,
the presentation was excellent;
unfortunately, the meal was sub

par. To begin, I had asked the
waitress to make a simple sub
stitution, and this was to have
my Carbonara served on a bed
of hnguini _instead of spaghetti.
To my dismay, this was too
much for the staff to accom
plish. The sauce itself was pass
able, but it seemed salt had
been used in place of other
more traditional seasonings
such as garlic. The portion, as
was the case with the special,
was quite large, but quantity of
food, as well as fine presenta
tion, does not make up for a
lack of quality in food. 1 de
cided to not take the leftover
Carbonara home with me, ei
ther.

I also ordered a side of
garlic bread to complement my
meal. However, I would not

really call it garlic bread, nor
would I call it a complement.
To begin with, the key ingredi
ent in garlic bread is garlic.
Whether you like a little bit of
GARLIC or you like a copious
amount of GARLIC, you
should he able ro taste the

GARLIC on the GARLIC
bread. I think I've made my
point. To conclude, I was ec
static to say "ciao" to the Buona
Fortuna Ristorante, and I know
this is a meal I shall never for
get no matter how hard I try.
For an average meal without a
dinner salad or bread of any
sort, one can dine at Buona
Fortuna for about $20 includ
ing a tip. However, those of
you reading this article prob
ably will not go there, so it does
not really matter what the cost
may be.

Letters to the Editor

"So ghetto:"
refocused I think it was commend
able of Justin Arnold to write
his Opinion column, "'So
ghetto': A reality check." It
takes guts to write such a heart
felt and in-depth piece. I have
the somewhat easier, yet
equally important, task of re
sponding to his arguments!
Judging from the conver
sations I heard and was a part
of after reading Mr. Arnold's
column, I anticipate that more
people than normal will feel the
need to voice their own opin¬

ions about a column in The
Gettysburgiart. I think that is
wonderful! I'd like to thank
Mr. Arnold for writing some
thing that evoked dialogue on
campus other than the com
mon debates over underage
drinking, the pros and cons of
Greek Life, and town-gown
relations. One of the most im
portant parts of a liberal arts
education is engaging in de
bate, learning how to argue,
and, perhaps most important,
coming to an understanding of
one's personal beliefs and the
beliefs of others.

Another important aspect
of a liberal arts education is the
opportunity to learn from one's
peers and their diverse experi
ences. Often this aspect is di
minished at Gettysburg College
because of our rather homoge
neous student body. Again, I'd
like to thank Mr. Arnold for
offering the campus what he
knows about the reality of ghet
tos. I wish, though, that he
would have included the name
and author of the text from
which he drew his information
about the six dimensions of the
ghetto so that students inter
ested in learning more about
the social reality of ghettos
could read the text and inter
pret it for themselves.
While I greatly appreciate
and admire Mr. Arnold's initia¬

tive in writing his article, I am
displeased with the contrary
feelings with which the article
left me. I strongly disagree
with the belief that "young

white Americans have no cul
ture." There is no denying that
African popular culture is very
influential in the lives of young
Americans, whether they are of
African, European, Asian, Aus
tralian, Middle Eastern, Latino,
or any other ethnic descent. I,
however, do not believe that I
lack my own culture because I
enjoy learning about African
culture or listening to African
music. I still greatly appreci
ate and enjoy the cultural tra
ditions my parents and commu¬

nity have taught me.
The world is becoming
more global, and it is nearly
impossible to perpetuate the
labels of "ours" and "theirs."
Learning about and sharing
with other cultures and tradi
tions enhances the beauty and
richness of the world. Clearly
defining what belongs to "us"
and what belongs to "them,"
especially by accusing people of
stealing culture, hinders any
progress in bettering under
standing and relations between
groups of people.

Mr. Arnold and I, how
ever, have both strayed some
what from the immediate topic
at hand, that being the use of
the word "ghetto" in a theme
party's name and in students'
everyday speech. I think a
more pertinent overall message
for Mr. Arnold's article would
have been to be considerate and
aware of how one's own words,
actions, and decisions affect
others. Using the word
"ghetto," for example, is not
appropriate in certain contexts,

especially those that mock or
diminish the horrors of ghetto
life. I agree with Mr. Arnold
in that it is not funny to
"trivialize this noxious environ
ment."
Mr. Arnold's column pro
vided a great deal of informa
tion about the reality of ghet
tos and sparked dialogue on
campus. For this I think the
Gettysburg campus should be
thankful. His argument, how
ever, lost relevance when he
began defining what is strictly
"ours" and what is "theirs" and
blaming a certain group of

people for "taking" anothei 's
culture. I believe that the fun
damental idea students should
secure from Mr. Arnold's col
umn is not one of accusing and
blaming people for stealing cul
ture, but the idea that all people
need to learn about and respect
other people's beliefs and cul
tures, think before they speak
and act, and strive to be con
siderate to all people.
Annalisa DeBacco '02
"So ghetto:" the
Greek perspective
I am writing on behalf of
the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity in
response to the editorial by Jus
tin Arnold entitled "So ghetto:
A reality check" which ap
peared in the March 30 edition
of The Gettysburgian.

Mr. Arnold attacked the
Phi Kappa Psi fraternity for
holding what he deemed to be
a "ghetto party." As a member
of Phi Kappa Psi I feel it is nec
essary to elucidate the actual
circumstances of this event.
First, I would like to
apologize to anyone who may
have been offended by this
party. Stereotyping or mock
ing any minority was not our
intention.

The theme of the party
was "gangsters" and did not in
any way attempt to emulate life
in the ghetto. Gangsters come
from all walks of life. The
theme of the party was not in
tended to imply any notions of
race or class. Mr. Arnold's as
sertion that this party somehow
degraded the collective situa
tion of members of a minority
is incorrect and in fact consti
tutes a misrepresentation of
this party, its themes and its

sponsors.
Mr. Arnold's pride in his
African American heritage and
his courage in enumerating the
problems facing African Ameri
cans in a Eurocentric society
should be applauded. How
ever, his inflammatory attack
on Phi Kappa Psi's party is in
dicative of nothing less than <i

manipulation of the circum
stances ot a benign social gath
ering to promote his own
agenda. While Mr. Arnold's
argument about ghettos is poi
gnant, his means for introduc
ing it is both false and pusillani
mous. Branding a campus orga
nization for something as rep
rehensible as racism as a spring
board for delivering a message
should not be tolerated, no
matter how vital that message
is. As a member of Phi
Kappa Psi I was justifiably out
raged by Mr. Arnold's misrep
resentation of the circum¬

stances of our party. However,
even if I was not a member of
the Greek organization tar
geted by Mr. Arnold, I would
have found his vindictive dia
tribe ob|ectionable. His thinly
veiled racism was a shameful
confirmation of his own asser
tion that racial problems are
still alive and well even at a
place as seemingly idyllic as
Gettysburg College.
Mr. Arnold's racism is
evinced by the "us versus them"
dichotomy employed in the ar
ticle as well as the inclusion of
such blatantly offensive state
ments as "young white Ameri
cans have no culture of their

own. I submit to Mr. Arnold
that the racism inherent in his
column serves as an impedi
ment to the understanding and
cultural recognition he seems
to be attempting to facilitate.
I feel that the message
regarding the pervasive and
continuing relegation of Afri
can Americans to ghettos that
Mr. Arnold conveyed in his
editorial is an important one.
It is imperative that Gettysburg
College's campus community
addresses this issue and does
everything it possibly can to
alleviate it. However, I think
that Mr. Arnold could have
amply made his point without
falsely indicting Phi Kappa Psi
for racism and denigrating the
cultural perspectives ot other
elements ot the campus.

Read your
history: the
ghetto is nothing
to celebrate
I am writing in regard to
the opinion column printed in
this paper last week about
"ghetto" parties. The reason
for my response is the general
attitude I have observed over
the course of this past week in
light of the column.
As I have had conversa
tions with my friends and over
heard conversations between
others, I have come to feel that
there is an overall trend of
people missing the point of the
column. The idea of the col
umn was not to offend anyone
or to stop people from having
parties. The idea of the column
was to create an awareness that
many people seem to lack.

We have all heard the
term "the Gettysburg bubble"
and whether we agree with this
association or not, in this situ
ation, it is very accurate. We
live in a bubble when we think
that having a party with a
"ghetto" theme is not going to
offend anyone, and we also live
in a bubble when we think that
the term "ghetto" defines
people wearing baggy pants
and listening to rap music, or
whatever else is attributed to a
"ghetto" party. This is exactly
the point. A ghetto is nothing
to celebrate with a party, nor is

it a style of dress. It is an op
pressive institution which is not
healthy, safe or fun.
Also, in response to the
comments I have heard from
people regarding the author;
you are correct, he is angry. But
would you not be too? Most
compassionate, rational, intel
ligent human beings would be
angry at the atrocities inflicted
upon people who are not of
European descent. If this is
something you don't under
stand immediately, why don't
you brush up on your Ameri
can history. I think it would
be a valuable lesson for us all.

Graduation revoked!
April. 1 can scarcely believe what
is happening to me. My college career
will be coming to an abrupt halt faster
than I can say "One 190-Octane" at Fat
Tuesdays in Myrtle Beach. This marks
the end of sixteen straight years of
schooling. Sixteen years of exams and
papers. Sixteen years of lecture notes
and class discussion. Sixteen years of
worrying about this grade and that
teacher. In these last six weeks of
school, I will be spending all of the time
I possibly can with the many people I
have come to know so well at this
school. This is the time we celebrate
our last rew weeks as dependents, be
fore leaping into the world of rent, bills,
and bosses. Commencement weekend
is truly our last time to come together
as the class ot 2000 and celebrate what
we have gone through together and
what is to come.

For some people, that well-mer
ited, and essential, convocation will not
be realized. I am not speaking of those
who decided on the five-year plan, or
students who failed multiple classes, or
even those who simply made oversights
m scheduling. I am speaking of a stu
dent who fell through the cracks of the
system. 1 am speaking of a student who
was ill advised in her last year of edu
cation. 1 am speaking of a student who
was overlooked by the registrar. I know
this student. I know the struggles she
has gone through to be successful in
college. After planning her senior year
meticulously and having her courses
approved by her advisor, as well as sub
mitting them to the registrar, she envi

Caption angers
performers
In regard to the last edition _oiThe
Gettysburgian, we are compelled to
write a brief note about a comment
published under your article about our
band. Although the article was flatter
ing, and we do thank you for the press
regarding our benefit show, the caption
below our picture was unacceptable.
In the caption you referred to one
of our band members as the "token fe
male" of the band. This comment was
not only gender biased and offensive,
but completely off base and not at all
in accordance with the inner workings
of our band. Anyone who has heard
Ms. Sam Gregg sing cannot by any
means claim that there is anything to
ken about her. She is an integral and
important member of our band who
deserves the respect which her many
talents have earned her. For a newspa
per which functions under the auspices
of the College to print such a slander is
vagrantly unprofessional.

In light of this mistake we ask for
a correction in your next edition, and a
formal apology to Ms. Gregg. This will
at least remedy some of the hurt which
this careless comment has caused us.
With regret,
The Warrior Poets.

Consider This....

The debate over evolution versus creationism has been a
heated topic since a decision last summer by the Kansas Board
of Education not to force students to study evolution. The issue
resurfaced as some Kansas teachers recently stated their intent
to teach evolution, despite the new school programs.
Most scientists condemned the decision, citing that evolu-

could then be created to help students deal with their own opin
ions or interpretations of either creationism or evolution. Discus
sion and acknowledgment of ideas is far more valuable than cen
sorship.

tion was provable fact while creationism is
not. Creationists do not accept the fact that
species, including humans, could have de
veloped from lower forms of life.
The problem here is the role of the pub
lic school in education. This country has a
long history of maintaining a separation of
church and state. Public schools are state
run institutions, accountable to all of their
constituent citizens. It is reasonable and
appropriate for public school to teach cur
riculum that is provable, factual and not
based on opinion. While neither creationist

theory or evolution can strictly be proven or
dismissed, concrete evidence exists to show
that evolution is an accurate model of the
development of life while creationism is
largely based on conjecture or interpreta
tion. Schools should not be telling their stu
dents which theory is "right," but should pro
vide the most factual, provable information.
Furthermore, creationism is available
to students in their religious and family lives.
Few students discuss scientific evolution
over the dinner table. Therefore, public
schools serve a valuable function in provid
ing information that is not readily available
elsewhere.

In deciding whether or not to teach evo
lution and/or creationism, school boards
should remember to keep curriculum cen
tered around factual material. Assiqnments

The optimism of cynics

I.A. lSHERWOOD
Social Critic
Have you ever noticed
how destructive people can be
towards each other on a daily
basis? How about how de
structive each one of us has
been on any given day toward
people who don't deserve our
torment?
I pose these questions
simply because it is once again
that particular time of year
when people are at the height
of their academic stress, not to
mention a time for seniors
when the stress of finding a job

On* Side ot Cynicism

and the possibility ot losing
loved ones looms in our near
future.
Academically this is a
very important month because
of term papers and exams, and
it is very easy for the stress level
of the average individual to
command their self-control and
tact, leaving very little for in
terpersonal relations. It would
be easy to rationalize this de
structive force by claiming that
it has solely to do with stress.
In reality this campus is a
pool of petty grievances, rival
ries, and personal manipulation
that reflects, I dare say it, the
attitudes of many in the upper

echelons ot our society. I see it
on almost a daily basis in the
CUB and especially Servo or
the bar on weekends.
Mind you, I am not guilt
less of all of this, but I have re
alized a few things in my days
here; simply that honesty, with
a degree of tact (painful lesson
learned) is almost always bet
ter than letting an issue linger
and brood in its own bitterness.
If there is any word I know well
enough it is that one, but I
know it so well that I know it
is not the right way to go
through one's life.
For example, every week
I sit down and write this col¬

umn mulct the auspices of cyni
cism, yet it is my firm belief that
nobody is ti Lily a cynic who
does not absolutely reek of ide
alism, so much that they are
disappointed by those around
them. It anyone around you
ever calls himself or herself a
great cynic, it is easy to see
through their shell of latent
immature angst and realize that
the person knows very little
about the art ot self-evaluation.
I think that people in gen
eral are too caught up with the
opinions ot their closest peers,
their distant comrades, and
their acquaintances of tace to
really know the true nature of
who they are as individuals.
This is no new theme, in fact it
is a very simple nonconformist
attitude, but it is one which I
personally think has great merit
here on our campus.

I am not speaking of
physical nonconformity mind
you, but that of the mind. I
don't really care what you want
to look like, that's not the real
issue here. So many people
think the same, talk the same,
walk the same, eat their salads
the same, sptead cream cheese
closely over a bagel using the
exact same whippy hand mo
tions it can make a person ill.
I am sorry, but not all ot your
pallets were genetically altered
in the_,exact same way.
No matter how we look
at it, the vast majority ot people

in this world wish to portray
themselves as flawless to their
friends and loved ones. We
find shelter in the standards of
society because it makes us feel
a part of something better than
how we leally feel about our
selves. We hide within any
given _gioup to avoid having to
_taeu up to oui own mediocre
feais. That's why we spend so
much time covering our own
asses by lifting in to out little
_gtoups ot people who really
_aien_'t that interesting after all.
We waste so much time
trying to convince the world

that we are just as beautiful as
it is, but, time after time, we
fall short, become vulnerable,
and then the world suffocates
us and bitter disregard ensues.
I am the worse hypocrite in the
world because I do it just as
much as all of you, but at least
I am trying to say that all of that
really sucks. I have my flaws
in my eyes and the world
around me, and now those
flaws have simply become more
interesting than the rest of the
world.

I don't know anything
about sociology or psychology
or any of that learned material.
All I know is what I have seen
for the last four years, and per
sonally I am tired of watching
people pick each other apart
for thinking or feeling a little
bit differently. This helps nei
ther the aggressor nor the vic
tim because it only contributes
to this false sense of reality we
have all gained sheltered and
pent up in a small, isolated and
economically deprived commu
nity.

1 am sick of hearing daily
gossip which eventually will
make its way back to the ac
cused individual and just lead
to a repeat of the cycle of bit
terness. 1 don't want everyone
to get along (so boring), but for
our culture's sake, I just wish
that people would try to be a
little objective and honest, ex
amine their own selves first,
and want to learn about the
different things and people
which make life what it is sup
posed to be.
Unfortunately, happiness
is not tot everyone; it is those
who can't see the bare beauty
m variety that have led to psy
chological epidemics and a
whole nation on unnecessary
drugs to feel better. There are
no better drugs in the world
than the human mind and
heart, and this is coming from
someone who lost the former
freshman year and arguably
can't find the latter most of the
rime.

Fight the urge: Say no to sleaze

by Rick Deutsch
Columnist
Sometimes in life we
want to walk the easy path. We
wish to forget all the sacrifices
that come along with doing
what is right and moral, and
take what comes easiest with
out a fight. No moral check
points, no standards, and no
guilt. Who cares if it's right?
'it's fun.
Every once in a while we
apply these loose standards in
our daily lives, like when we

have unprotected sex, or
double the speed limit, or flip
on Jerry Springer. / probably
won't get an STD or a speeding
ticket, we convince ourselves.
And no, most times you prob
ably won't. The risk, while a
risk, seems worth the benefits.
It probably can't hurt me
to watch a sleazy talk show
once in a while, we tell our
selves. Only what's at stake
here is perhaps more grave than
before. I don't mean to belittle
the risks involved with unpro
tected sex and driving at break¬

neck speeds, but in my eyes, the
preservation of the life of one
individual will always be sec
ond in importance to the pres
ervation of humanity.
Talk shows, while their
luster has faded a bit, still play
a large part in the networks'
ratings and consequently, in the
living rooms of daytime televi
sion watchers. I know this be
cause they're still on. And be
cause they're still on, I know
that people are still watching
them. This is the cause of my

concern.
The whole premise of a
trashy talk show is to allow its
viewers to feel better about
themselves through scrutiniz
ing pathetic people. The scum
of the nation are put on stage
to shock even the most liberal
American. Nazi Skinheads
Raised by Orangutans. Grand
parents With Nipple Fetishes.
Teens Who Stiip For Daddy.
These pseudo-people serve as
a good standard for compari
son if our goal is to raise our
self-esteem through mocking
others. But if we have higher
expectations of ourselves as a

people who exude dignity and
command credibility, then this
trivial form of self assurance
must be ousted from our soci
ety. The damage inflicted by
talk shows occurs when it
changes our perceptions ot
what is acceptable. Television
is a powerful medium in its
ability to stretch norms and es
tablish new boundaries.
"Freaks" have always been
around, but only now are they
influencing our _standatds
(mostly by lowenng them)
since we've invited them into
our living rooms. It's easy to
blame Jerry Springer for it all,
and I hate to sound trite, but
it's a free country...and you're
free to watch something else.

The temptation to ignoi e
the ramifications of our actions
is great, and so too are the con
sequences. If we never allowed
ourselves the pleasures in
volved in taking the easiest path
and setting our moral chaiac
ter aside once in a while, we'd
probably all go crazy. But when
our nation's fortitude and in
tegrity is at stake, it becomes a
cause worth fighting for.

High gas prices caused by lack of strong policy

by Dan Ballentyne
Columnist
Many of you own cars. I
would be very surprised if a
family of a student here did not
have a car. So the price of gaso
line affects us all. A large num
ber of Americans depend on
gasoline for their livelihoods.
The Clinton-Gore
Administration's lack of foreign
and energy policies have failed
all Americans, but especially
truck drivers.
One of the many criti
cisms of many administrations
of the second half of the twen
tieth century centers on our
over-dependency on foreign
oil. Dependency on foreign oil
allows a nation to be held hos
tage economically by another
power, as this country learned
during the gas crisis of the Ford
and Carter Administrations.

The sad truth is that un
der the Clinton-Gore Admin
istration, our dependence on
foreign oil has increased; 56%
of our oil comes from foreign

countries. Think about that:
over half our oil comes from
another country.
The economic and na
tional security implications of
that fact are astounding. In the
event of war, we could be cut
off from half of our oil by
means of a small group of stra
tegically placed submarines.
Economically, if OPEC wanted
to get concessions from the
United States, they could rec
reate the gas crisis of the 1970s
overnight.
That being said, if there

was not any way to avoid our
current oil dependence situa
tion, it would be forgivable.
However, this is not the case.
The Clinton-Gore administra
tion has literally forbidden any
drilling of an oil reserve in
Alaska, that, if drilled at the
fastest rate possible could take
the United States completely
off foreign oil for the next
thirty years. Of course radical
environmentalists make argu
ments, based on pseudo-sci
ence, that the environment will
be hurt.

This is patalse. One
needs look no further than the
Audubon Society to see why. In
Louisiana they maintain a wild
life preserve upon which they
drill oil, obviously without
damaging the environment.
This just proves that it can be
done, despite what fear-mon
genng radical environmental
ists say.
Also, the Clinton-Gore
administration has barred both
onshore and offshore oil explo
rations. Gore has said that he
will continue that policy. That
policy of course can only lead
to more dependence on foreign
oil and higher prices at the
pump. Governor Bush, how
ever, realizes that we cm ex
plore and drill for oil without
hurting the environment.

Also, the Clinton-Gore
Administration's lack ot foreign
policy, and backbone in deal
ing with other countries,
landed us in this position.
When OPF.C decided ro cut
production last year, despite
the fact that this counti y liber
ated one nation, and saved the

rest of the Middle East from a
potential two-bit Hitler in the
person of Saddam Hussein, this
administration did nothing.
The Clinton-Gore Administra
tion made no moves at all to
try to convince OPEC to
change their minds, and even
when the American people
cried for relief, the government
was timid in dealing with

OPEC.
The Clinton-Gore Ad
ministration also did nothing at
home to help the American
people, and they caused some
of the problems. 1 am referring
to the Gore Gas Tax of 1993,
which was a 4.5-cent increase
on the federal tax on gasoline.
I call it such because, in a
Democratic Congress, Al Gore
cast the tie-breaking vote to
raise your gas tax, which no
Republican voted for and
which is pai t of "the largest tax
increase in the history of
world," as stated by retiring
New York Senator Daniel
Patrick Moynahan, a Demo
crat. Also, after they have re
fused to dip into the national

strategic reserve to slow down
the rate of gas tax increase by
saying that there is no prece
dent for dipping into the re
serve in peacetime. This is a lie.
J ust as recently as 1990, we
dipped into the reserve for ci
vilian use, in peacetime, to al
ieviate some of the rising costs
due to the Iraqi Occupation of
Kuwait.
Finally, they have refused
to support both a measure to
eliminate the Gore Gas Tax and
a measure to temporarily sus
pend the entire Federal Gas

Tax. These are not the actions
of an administration that cares
about the people.
I support the suspension
of the gas tax until Labor Day;
by then we should hopefully
have resolved this issue. As
much as I would like to repeal
the tax, now is not the time to
make the decision. When emo
tions are high, bad policy is
made, whether on taxes, guns,
or whatever issue. We must not
forget the immortal words of
Benjamin Franklin, "Passion
governs, and she never governs
wisely."

Illegal anti-choice violence endangers all parties involved

by Rachel Hanson
Columnist
Earlier this year, the
Feminist Majority Foundation
released their findings about
anti-choice violence in the
United States in their seventh
annual National Clinic Vio
lence Survey Report.
The survey found that in
1999, 20 percent of abortion
clinics were victims of one or
more forms of extreme anti
choice violence, including
"blockades, invasions, bomb
threats, bombings, arson
threats, arsons, chemical at
tacks, death threats, [and] stalk
ing." The survey also found
that the percentage of clinics

that are the targets of violent
anti-choice actions is barely
down from 22 percent in 1998,
but has dropped sharply from
its peak of 54 percent in 1994.
And for the first time since
1995, abortion clinics are ac
tually facing more violence.
Some clinics experience
harsher attacks than others.
About five percent of abortion
clinics are "besieged with mul
tiple, and often simultaneous,
types of violence as [anti
choice] extremists continue to
try to force clinics [to close
down]."
The 1999 survey also
found that clinics now face pre
viously untried forms of attack.
Cyberspace is one of the new
mediums through which clin¬

ics are being threatened —18
percent reported threats and
antagonism via the Internet.
Anthrax is also becoming a ter
rorist tool ot choice among
anti-choice radicals. Eleven
percent of American clinics re
ported being threatened with
Anthrax letters, and in January
alone, more than 30 clinics re
ceived Anthrax threats.
It seems unbelievable that
people who do nothing illegal
or wrong are facing such hor
rific violence and being forced
to live in fear. Eleanor Smeal,
President of the Feminist Ma
jority Foundation, put it per
fectly when she said, "The fact
that one-fifth of the women's
health clinics in this country are
still battered day after day with

violence in unconscionable, ers victims of anti-choice vio

Ike Vmini tic nn'_s Pulpit
The vice presidential "race" is on

by John Dunlap
Political Columnist
Last Monday and Tues
day Governors George W. Bush
of Texas and Tom Ridge of
Pennsylvania campaigned to
gether. This scene could be
come a familiar one if Bush taps
Ridge to be his running mate.
With the campaign for
the Republican and Democratic
Nominations over, the race for
vice president begins. This
campaign is one of rumors, and

in the end the votes of only
George W. Bush and Al Gore
will count.
Governor Bush has a
large pool of potential running
mates from which he may
choose. With Republicans con
trolling the majority of gover
norships and with a Republican
majority in Congress there is
plenty of GOP talent out there.
History shows that vice presi
dential nominees usually do not
make a difference.
Democrats attempted to
make an issue out of vice presi¬

dential candidates Richard
Nixon, Spiro Agnew and Dan
Quayle but failed each time. In
1980 Ronald Reagan's choice
of George Bush helped to unify
Republicans in the face of John
Anderson's independent candi
dacy. There have been, how
ever, occasions when the choice
of a vice president did matter.
For example, without Lyndon
Johnson on the ticket, J ohn F.
Kennedy may not have been
elected president. In a race that
will be close, George W. Bush
cannot pick a running mate that
will be a distraction; he should
choose a running mate that can
cut into Democratic strength
while energizing Republicans.
In 1996 Bob Dole's choice of
Jack Kemp energized Republi
cans, even if Kemp did prove
to be a disappointment in the

divided the party. This yeai the
religious right united behind
Bush in the tace of the McCain
candidacy which now gives
Bush more of an ability to reach
out beyond the GOP. While Pat
Buchanan may be a tactoi as
the potential Reform Party
nominee for president, I sus
pect Republicans want to win
and defeat Al Gore so much
that Bush has a little room to

maneuver.
I do believe that the best
choice for Bush would be Gen
eral Colin Powell. The party
of Lincoln should be the first
party to nominate an African
American for national office
and the selection of Powell will
excite all voters. Powell has
foreign policy credentials that
are a potential weakness foi
Bush and he is an inspiration
to many Americans. The ques
tion is: will he do it? Probably
not. Another possibility is
Elizabeth Dole. Mrs. Dole, the
former president of the Ameri
can Red Cross is a pro-life
woman who has appeal beyond

the Re- ^__W
p u b11 c a n _^^H
Part) and _^*
could bring in
female voters. A
ticket made up of the
son of George Bush
and the wife of Bob Dole
would be an exciting pi us

pect for Republicans.
As 1 mentioned before,
Governor Ridge is also a pos
sibility. He is a Vietnam vet
eran who has served as a con
gressman. He could probably
delivei Pennsylvania for the
ticket, which would be a big
steal from Al Gore. Ridge is
also a moderate catholic, which
could aid Bush in two areas.
On the othei hand, we have not
had a ticket made up of two
Governors since Thomas
Dewey and Farl Warren in
194S, and that did not go so
well. Senator Connie Mack of
Florida is a potential VP.
Mack's two grandfathers were
a Senatoi from Texas and the
owner/manager of the Philadel
phia Athletics. He is an excit¬

ing figure who would be a
strong campaigner. Between
Jeb Bush being Florida's gov
ernor and Connie Mack being
the vice presidential candidate,
Republicans should not even
have to worry about Florida
(which Al Gore hopes to steal).
With Bush's brother governor
of the state, picking Mack
could be somewhat of a waste
for the Bush campaign.
The possibility of John
McCain is there, but he says he
does not want to do it. Rather
than picking McCain who is
not a very loyal Republican
Senator, and so would probably
not be a loyal running mate for
Bush, picking a McCain sup
porter instead of McCain may
be a good idea. Potential
choices are Senator Fred Th
ompson of Tennessee, an actor
who is from Al Gore's home
state and Senator Chuck Hagel
of Nebraska, a Vietnam veteran
new to Capitol Hill.

Other possibilities in
clude Congresswoman Jennifer
Dunn of Washington and Con
gressman J.C. Watts of Okla
homa. Both are rising leaders
who have been strong allies of
the Texas Governor. Finally,
there is Gov. George Pataki of
New York, who may not be able
to carry New York for the ticket
but could probably help defeat
Hillary for Senate.
As for Gov. Christie
Whitman of New Jersey, while
she did ciit taxes and is a mod
ci.ire from the northeast,
Whitman was barely reelected
at home and opposes even the
ban on partial birth abortions,
which could alienate some con
servatives.

Graduation

was taking a course that would
not count towards graduation,
and she would be one credit
short of walking across that
stage. Fortunately, she has the
opportunity to complete her
final credit by July of 2000.
For some reason, unbeknownst
to me, this is not good enough
for the College. She is still un
able to walk at graduation, but
the college told her that she
could come back in December
and walk across the pseudo
stage in one of the small audi
toriums on campus and receive
her diploma.
J am appalled. The rea
son that the College will not let
her walk is due to "prestige"
and "honor". I can relate to
that. 1 do not agree with let
ting someone walk at gradua-

contmued from page 11

tion that has failed classes or
violated the Honor Code. I feel
that it would be unfair to me
as a student who has struggled
to achieve all the credits neces
sary to graduate. However, I
also believe that an institution
that prides itself on honor
should take full responsibility
for an administrative mistake.
When we get our courses ap
proved by our advisors, we as
sume that they have taken the
time to carefully review
whether we have selected the
appropriate courses for gradu
ation, especially senior advi
sors. In addition, we have a
system of checks and balances
where the registrar completes
a sheet to indicate what gradu
ation requirements are not met.
This unfortunate student fell

through the cracks. I am by no
means fixating blame on any
person or department, I am
simply stating that the college
needs to take responsibility for
its oversight.
We all chose to attend a
small institution, wheie we
would know our professors and
classmates well, and where we
would get individualized atten
tion. The school has <\ strict
policy regarding giaclualion,
but in this situation, 1 believe
that special consideration must
be given. After all, that is win
we came to Gettysbuig Col
lege. I will be veiy disap
pointed in this institution it
they fail to take lesponsibihty
for my friend, and any othui
students who fall through the
cracks. We at Gettysburg have

a strong sense of community,
and I would hate to see my best
friend excluded from the last
day that we get to celebrate this
closeness. Graduation will not
hold the same amount of sen
timentality toi me, and the
many seniors who are close to
my _fiiend, if she is unable to
pai ticipate. Honor means that
an institution is recognized for
its high standing among others.
1 his honoi is earned as a re
sult of icsponsibility and hon
esty. It is time that the College
cmbi_.iLc the tine meaning of
honoi and accept then mistake.

Last Thursday, Gettys

match up with long-standing
rival Drew University.

minutes, the Bullets sprung to
a quick 3-0 lead off a pair of
goals from senior captain Amy
Stambaugh and another from
sophomore attacker Anna
Haugen.
The Rangers answered
back to cut the lead to 3-1, but

sophomore Becky Bucha and
junior Jessica Seedorf found the
net to advance the lead 5-1.
Drew closed the gap with
a four-goal run and went into

Bullets Track leaves mark in Virginia

By Lauren Davis
Assistant Sports Editor
The Virginia sun was hot,
and so was the Bullets track
team at the Christopher New
port Captains' Classic on Sat
urday. Gettysburg made the
five-hour trek to compete
against some unfamiliar com
petition and came back with
medals, PR's, and sunburns—
overall, a very successful week
end for the Bullets.
Although there was no
team scoring in the meet, it was
clear that both the men and
women's team held their own
against several highly rated
teams, including Division III
sprint powerhouse Lincoln
University.

"The competition was
strong," said junior captain
Kelley Lord, "but we per
formed well and as a result
many athletes had personal
bests." First-year thrower Lara
Knudsen won the first event of

her college career, throwing the
javelin 115'0", fifth on
Gettysburg's all-time list.
Knudsen was awarded the Sil
ver Spike for her efforts.
Distance runners Kristin
Roberts and Lord picked up
first place honors in the 3000
and 10,000-meter runs, respec
tively. Roberts, a sophomore,
pulled away from the pack
early in the race to finish in
10:58.20. Lord broke the tape
in 43:33.00, a meet record.
Senior Anne Schenck
made sure the Bullets were
well-represented in the jumps
and sprints. She finished sec
ond in the high jump (5_'2") and
fourth in the long jump (17'8").
Schenck then made her
way over to the track, where
she finished fifth in the 100
with a time of 13.20.

Her supporting cast in
the sprint events included first
year Joanna Silver and junior
Courtney Hurd, who finished
5th and 6th in the 400 with
times of 1:00.08 and 1:01.81,
respectively.

Senior Cathy Spanglei
also placed in three events. Hei
throw of 104'5" in the hammer
was good for second, and she
finished fourth and fifth in the
discus (106'9") and shot put
(33'1O"), respectively.
First-year Ton Scott
placed in the throws as well,
picking up sixth place in the
javelin with a distance of 78'0".
Gettysburg got a 3-4 fin
ish from senior Enka Durst and
first-year Katie Diehl m the
pole vault to cap the Bullets'
placing in the held. Durst
vaulted 8'0" and Diehl fol
lowed with a 7'6'.
Sophomore Lauren Davis
chipped in a fourth-place fin
ish in the 1500 in 4 57.7, plac
ing her 8th on the all-time list,
and a fifth place in the (SOU
(2:29.0).

Both women's ¦ clay
teams continued to be a pies
ence on the track, even in the
face of the fastest competition
they've seen all yeai.
The 4x 100 finished third
in 50.71, just .81 seconds off
the school record.

The4x400ofsemoi Ancli
Them, junior Ken Hymen,
Huid, and Silver finished off
the meet for the women with
their fastest time of the year,
4:04.50, good for second
place. On the men's side, the
throwers had several place
winners in the field. Senior
Scott Grabus finished fourth
and fifth in the hammer throw
and the javelin (131 '5" and
150'6").
Classmate Gene Kraus
finished fifth and sixth behind
Grabus witht throws of
124'I I" and MOM", respec
tively. Meanwhile, senior Mike
Williams picked up a pair of
sixth-places in the shot put
(44'4") and discus (l)4'3").
Sophomoie Chris Russo
placed m the field as well, clear
ing 6'00" in the high jump to
match his best height of the

year. The Bullets also had top
six finishers in each of the four
distance events.
luniot Ion Catlett took

fourth in the 1500 in 4:03.1 to
move up to ninth on
Gettysburg's all-time list.
Sophomore Bryan
Brander finished second in the
steeplechase with a time of
10:18.86. First-year Dan Cam
pion came in 11 seconds be
hind to take fifth.
Junior Jason Rose and
sophomore Ray Gephart pro
vided a 5-6 finish in the 5000
with times of 16:29.10 and
16:35.20, respectively.
Junior Dave Gary took
the bronze in the 10,000 in
34:59.00, followed by junior
Tim Orr, sixth in 41:22.00.
Competition in the
sprints was stiff, as Lincoln
Univeisity dominated every
event from the 100 through the
800. However, first-year Chris
Buchanan did pull out a sixth
place finish in the 110 hurdles
with a time of 15.99.

With two successful
meets under their belt, the Bul
lets now prepare to meet some
conference comptetion at the

This past weekend, in a
much anticipated showdown,
the Gettysburg College Men's
Lacrosse team fell 14-3.
The Sea Gulls, who are
the defending national cham
pions avenged their only loss
from last year, playing like the
No.l team in the country. The
game dealt Gettysburg their
first loss in seven games, while
the Sea Gulls improved their
record to 10-0.
The game started off with
four unanswered Salisbury
State goals, en route to a 6-0
lead. Just before the intermis
sion, junior Tommy Pearce
found the back of the net, the
Bullets' lone goal of the first
half, to go into the locker room
down 7-1.

The Bullets tallied two
goals in the third quarter, both
of which were scored by sopho
more Ric Bremer. Sophomore
Pete Milhman was credited

Tewes of Salisbury St. com
bined for eleven saves in the
net, to hold off the Bullets at
tack. The team is now looking
forward to their next game,
hoping to rebound from the
disappointing loss. This
Wednesday, the Bullets will
open their Centennial Confer

at Musselman Stadium. Game
time is 4 p.m.

Fords no match for Bullets fire as
Gettysburg Sweeps Haverford

Gettysburg ball players rev up their engines, prepare for upcoming games

by Stevc Jenkins
Staff Writcr
Okay. So the well-oiled machine
has hit some tough roads. After non
league losses to Juniata and Catholic,
the engine seemed to be coughing up
smoke.
Swamped 15-0 by Juniata, and
edged 8-2 by Catholic, the Bullets
seemed as if their Ferrari had instantly
been traded in for a Chevy station
wagon. Luckily, the team got some
prime fuel for a slowing engine:
Haverford College.
In game one of the twinbill, Drew
Chiesa stymied the Fords with his left
arm tossing a six hit shutout. Chiesa's

command of all his pitches was tremen
dous as he allowed no walks, and struck
out four batters.
"Drew does well because he can
locate his pitches," said second baseman
Kevin Grimm. "When you throw
strikes you always give yourself a good
chance to win."
Offensively, the Bullets put up
seven runs on ten hits, scoring one run
in the first inning, four in the third, and
their final run in the fifth.
Giving the engine its much
needed lube was Jim "Nasty" Nastasi
as he walked and scored in the first in
ning, and smoked a grand slam
homerun in the top of the third.
Driving in the remaining runs for
the Bullets were John Woods and

Grimm who each had RBI singles, and
Nick Marzella who drove in Greg Kosc
in the fifth inning.
Kosc and senior captain Chris
Lunardi also had two hits for the Bul
lets. "Fveryone _< ontnbuted today,"
said shortstop Brett Thorp. "F.veryone
did their little part to help the cause.
Whether you made plays in the field or
drove in runs, we were all on the same
page." In game two the Bullets ignition
was a little slow, but Marzella got the
engine jump started with a game tying
solo homer in the sixth inning.
With the game knotted a one run
a piece, Kosc was the sparkplug the
Bullets needed as he jacked a single in
the top of the last inning, scoring first
year Mike Connolly. Nastasi scored an
insurance run just a lew batters later to
put the Bullets on cruise _contiol for the
victory.

The pitching duties for game two
were handled by first-year rocket-armer
Matt Donahue. Donahue went the dis
tance for the complete game victory, al
lowing just one run on four hits.
"Matt made an impact," said first
year Henry Mullen, "but that's all any
of us want to do. We just want to con
tribute, and do out part to help the team
win." You hear that purr?
That is the engine running
smoothly again. After a few tough
curves in the road, the Bullets have to
remain focused on the final destination:
the Centennial Conference title.
With conference foes Western
Maryland, Johns Hopkins, and Ursinus
all appearing on the schedule in the next
ten days the Bullets had better be ready
to perform like a Ferrari, because the
conference title never goes to the Chevy

wagon
