"Statement on Residential and Social

Life" revised: Sophomore Rush remains

By Andrea Quarracino
Contributing Writ er

On February 5, 2000, the
Gettysburg College Board of Trustees
voted to adopt the "Statement on
Residential and Social
life," a plan _^ ~^~ to increase
the quality I % \^ of life be
yond the [^__^. classroom
for stu- dents. The
statement has sparked debate amongst
members of the College community,
as con- cerns about the future
of theli -TlCollege

. —™^————^I"Ir's just
an adjustment. It's just a change from
the way things are now," says Dean
Julie Ramsey. "We want this to work,
to be successful as we make this tran
sition."
The, Statement
has been /^W/~ a work in
progress \^/j?\_ for moie
' ' , re
cently amendments were made to the
original proposal. Initially, one of the
most controversial suggestions made
by the Board was to move Rush and
pledging for Greek organizations
fro m. .freshman
to sopho- pTjj more year.
The goal JrJ_ M of tllls
policy ad- ** _justment
focuses on stu¬

dents, with the hope that they will
be fully prepared and informed
about decisions regarding Greek
life. "Sopho

get to know Gettysburg College and
themselves before they make such
an important decision, " said Board
Chair David M. LeVan.
According to the original rec
ommendation, Sophomore Rush

would have been implemented in Fall
2001 •« Now > tne

This allows fraternities and so
rorities more time to adjust and adapt
to the Sophomore Rush policy.
Thus, the amendments that were
made took the questions

and con- B A T~^ B cerns of the
_ColleRei /\ I _Bcommunity
-"
¦ ¦eration.
"The changes took place in re
sponse to concerns expressed during
a panel discussion," says Ramsey.
"The trustees heard the concerns
laised by Greek and

alumni," . _. .

Rush Results

By Robin Roger
Staff Writer
Rush 2000 proved just as success
ful as Rush 1999. Fraternities added
130 new men, and sororities saw 123
women join their ranks.
The numbers for men's Rush reg
istration increased 21 percent from last
year, but not everyone who registered
followed through with the process. As
a result of some drop outs, fraternities
had virtually the same Rush results as
last year.
A number of rushees deferred

their bids due to athletic seasons or for
personal reasons. Dean Murphy and
Rush Chair Matt Sack (Phi Kappa Psi)
are examining potential reasons why
75 men did not continue with the Rush
process.
One possible explanation for the
increase in registration involves the
heavily endorsed "Go Greek" cam
paign, which was staged in part as a
response to the Sophomore Rush is
sue. The Greek system received much
publicity due to this controversy, and
this caused the fraternities and sorori
ties to unite under a common cause.

The Provost's office gets a
structural face-lift

By Kristim Mihr

The Office of the Pro
vost, which beais responsibil
ity for the administration, de
velopments and changes of
academic programs, curncu
lums, academic standards and
faculty personnel is officially
undergoing structural changes
this semester.
"The purpose of the re
structuring was to put some
one more senior into the new
roles so that I could delegate
some of my responsibilities to
them and so the faculty could
directly talk and settle issues
with them," said Dan
DeNicola, Provost of
Gettysburg College.

In the resti uctui ing pi o
cess, Teresa L. Amott and Uina
Satyavolu Ran assumed the
positions of Assistant Provost
and Vice Provost. These two
new titles replace what was
formerly the domain of the
Associate Provost.
"I wanted to take the Hat
structure of the office and give
it more hierarchy with these
positions having more final
authority on issues," said
DeNicola.
Professor Amott re
ceived her PhD in Economics
from Boston College and
taught for several years as As
sociate Professor of Econom
ics, also working as Academic
Coordinator of Residential
_Colleges. She served as chair
of seveial committees includ¬

ing the Admissions and Fi
nancial Aid Committee, rac
ult) development, and the
Economics depaitment at
Bucknell.
Some of hei |ob respon
sibilities include cuinculum
management, depaitmental
leviews, faculty appoint
ments, and policy administi a
tion, among otheis.
Professoi Satyavolu
specializes in Victorian Stud
ies and obtained her doctoi
ate in English from West Vn
ginia Univeisity. Most i e
cently, she has taught English
at Pennsylvania State Univer
sity-Mont Alto full tune, and
has been Adjunct Assistant
Professor at Gettysbuig Col
lege. Hei job _desti iption in¬

Congress looks for ways to slow
increases in college tuition

WASHINGTON -
Flush with money from smart
investments, administrators at
Williams College last month did
the unthinkable — they froze
the school's annual tuition for
the first time in more than 40
years — albeit at $3 1,520.
That was a rarity among
prestigious private schools. Of
ficials at the college in
Wilhamstown, Mass., hope the
price freeze will engender good
will and attract more top-notch
sons and daughters of money
conscious parents.
But experts say that's un
likely, mainly because of an at
titude prevalent among the
wealthy, which'holds that a
school charging less than its
competitors must not be as
good. So the Harvards and
Princetons of the world con¬

tinue to hike tuition each seal,
with little adveise impact on
their ability to attiact supeiioi
students.
That so-called "luxuiy
mentality" is just one of main
factors that have driven tuition
to unprecedented heights ovei
the last 20 >ears, analysts say.
This year the average combined
cost of tuition and tees at pub
lic tour-yeai institutions is
$3,356; it is $ 15,380 at pnvate
ones. Average tuition toi a full
time resident undergraduate
student rose 44 peicent from
1990 to 1996, according to the
General Accounting Office. In
the same period, the cost of liv
ing, as measured by the con
sumer price index, rose only
15.4 percent, and median
household income rose a mere
13.8 percent.

One result of skyrocket
ing tuition is that college has
become all but unaffordable for
most low-income families and

main middle-class ones, loie
mg both to hoi 1 ow heavil\, and
often (.lushing students with
debt toi decades.
No one is quite sine win

The National Commis
sion on the Cost of Highei Fdu

"As a lesult, theie is no leadiK
available information about
college costs and puces - 1101
is there a common national le
porting standard for eithei," the
commission report said.
But academia's veil of se
crecy may be lifting slowl) un

The Senate Governmen

the trend of rising college costs
at hearings Wednesday and
Thursday. College admimstra-

cation _c\peits acknowledged

I he colleges' own bills
aie diiven In expensive factois
such as complying with regula
tions, ieci _uiting faculty, acqun

of Rhodes College in Memphis,
Term., and chairman of the
National Association of Inde
pendent Colleges and Univer
sities. Costs per student soai ed
_^7 peicent at four-yeai public
institutions tiom 1987 to 1996,
and 69 peicent at private
schools, Troirtt said.

Most toui-yeai institu
tions will continue to see annual
inci eases, "probably at rates
averaging as much as one or
two points ovei inflation," said

William Massey, a professor at
Stanford University and a
prominent education consult
ant. Meanwhile, a uniform
system for reporting an
institution's costs, prices and
subsidies is being developed by
the National Association of
College and University Business
Officers. A task force of experts
has been working longer than
a yeai to devise a standard dis
closure format, said Gregory
Fusco, the consultant heading
the project.
Many tuition-paying par
ents voice frustration and con
fusion over a related phenom
enon: Why, they wonder, does
tuition keep going up even as
federal student financial aid
tops $41 billion a year?

"We appear to be pouring
more money into the system
only to have it mopped up by
tuition increases," said Sen. Su
san Collins, R-Maine.

Find the key that unlocks the future

Students turn to Career Planning and Advisi

by Kristin Roberts
Features Editor
One of the most valuable re
sources on campus at Gettysburg Col
lege may also be one of the least known.
Few students, it seems, are aware of the
wide array of information available re
garding the crucial decision that either
faces them presently or looms ahead in
the very near future: the answer to the
question, "What are you doing after
graduation?" This important and fear
inducing decision can affect a student's
entire life; a wise, informed choice may
pave the way to success, but a hasty,
poorly made choice will most likely lead
to struggles in the "real world."
Luckily, the dreaded decision

need not become a headache for
students at Gettysburg. The _jffi a
College provides us with Jfflra
the Career Planning and igKBg
Advising Center that will jmgm
gladly guide anyone to- _^HH
ward a sensible, realistic _^H
plan for life before and _^^M
after graduation. This _^^H
highly accessible office /_TtJJHH
is located on West _JOg
Stevens Street, next /_&_®mmB$
to the Women's Cen
ter and across from Admissions.
The friendly staff of the CPA
more than willing to assist students

are
in a

variety of ways that can make planning
for the future an enjoyable process
rather than a distressing one. "We're
more like the Office of Decision Mak
ing and Transition Management," said
Director Pat Mullane. Beginning in a
student's sophomore, or even first year,
the CPA staff seeks to pilot students
through all the steps of planning not
only the future, but also the present.
Student members of the staff-the
career outreach assistants-often speak
to first-year wellness classes, in addition
to any other groups who request pre
sentations, any time of the year. Pre
sentation topics include such skills as
contacting potential employers, inter
viewing and resume writing. These pre
sentations apply not only to lifetime
careers, but also to internships and sum
mer jobs. They emphasize the need to
design a strategy that leads to the pro
cess of choosing a career; students must

think about advantageous organizations
and positions on campus, useful intern
ships, and research experience early in
their college years. In addition to teach
ing students to do these things, the CPA
will also aid them in choosing majors
by using assessment tools.
Unfortunately, most students wait
until the spring of junior year or fall of
senior year to venture into the Career
Center. Although CPA would prefer to
see students earlier, they have plenty of
help to offer juniors and seniors.

Whether a student intends to go on to
graduate school or to enter the job mar
ket following graduation, the Career
Center is prepared to enlighten him or
her about the possible opportunities
available, regardless of the student's
major. "The biggest myth," said
H| Mullane, "is that Career Planning
_^ K and Advising is just for manage
H[ ment majors. That's not true
^_B we're for everyone!" He added,
^^ "Yo u don't have to know what
I——7 you want-that's why you come

The Career Library is
packed with over 250
books encompassing nu
^ merous career pathways

applicable to almost any
major or interest. In addition to the
library, five computers are available for
students to use in their employment
searches. Also helpful are computer
programs that suggest career options
based on a student's major and inter
ests. Engaging in the job-search process
during the senior year is the equivalent
of adding an extra class and a lab to a
student's schedule; many seniors find
themselves lacking the time to partici
pate in sports or other activities while
they apply for jobs or grad school. For
students who already know what they
want to do with their lives, the CPA staff
can direct them toward contacts such
as alumni or friends and family mem
bers who can help them obtain desir
able positions in companies.
Not only does the Career Center
deal with individuals and create presen
tations for special groups (for example,
they recently spoke to G.E.C.O. about
jobs in the environmental field), they
also sponsor and participate in pro-

ng for help in making post-graduation plans

grams and workshops here at
Gettysburg, and elsewhere, in conjunc
tion with other colleges.
In fact, the CPA is a sponsor of
today's Cumberland Valley Consortium
Job Fair in Frederick, MD. This par
ticular job fair features employers from
all areas of the job market, from insur
ance companies to school districts to
hospitals. Also, coming up on April
10th is the Helping Professions Job Fair,
held at Gettysburg. Mullane encour
ages all students to attend these and
othei job fairs, both heie and in the sui
rounding area. He advises acquiring a
list of participating companies before
attending job fairs and researching the
ones that appeal to a student. He sug
gests bringing along a resume, dressing
professionally, and preparing a short
speech in which the student describes
him or herself, including relevant per
sonal information, qualities favorable to
employers, and interests pertaining to

the job.
Job fairs
are also
beneficial to students
who just
want to ex
plore and
gain expe
rience in
talking to
employers

about the opportunities available to
them. '

Job fairs are not the only way the
Career Center is active with students.
It also holds graduate school fairs.

because they are as yet unsure what they
will do after graduation, quite a few of
them have their futures well planned.
We can all remember our days as high
school seniors nearing graduation.
College seniors experience similar emo
tions of fear and insecurity mixed with
feelings of excitement and anticipation
as they enter a new stage in life.
A few seniors already have con
crete plans, which include guaranteed
jobs or graduate school acceptance and
definite living arrangements. Hilary
Schenk is debating between attending
Penn State or the University of Virginia
in order to obtain her Ph. D. in chemis
try. Meanwhile, she will teach under
graduate chemistry labs to earn some

a job lined up in New Mexico with the
McBnde Foundation, helping inner-city
school districts all over the country.
Later on, he will continue his educa
tion in order to get his Master's degree
in either educational administration or
family law.
The majority of seniors seem to
have applied to numerous graduate
schools and employers and still await
acceptances so that they can make their
final decisions. Alicia Kofke hopes to
find a job at a local college or business
in either the human resources or coun
seling fields while she lives at home for
a year. This way, she can take a break
and save some money before she goes
back to school for her Master's degree
in psychology.
Jen Wise has a similar goal in
mind: she is seeking a job in the D.C.
area in the field of public relations. She
also plans to attend graduate school in
a few years, when she is ready.
Erika Durst aspires to teach En
glish and coach track at the middle

Kevin Lee also has his plans for
the next few years resolved. Next fall
he will return to Gettysburg to teach
fifth grade while he completes his teach
ing certification. Following that, he has

Best of Beantown to
invade Junction

by John _Zanders
Office 01 _Siudfni
Activities
This Friday, the Junction
will play host to two of the top
singer/songwriters to emerge
from Boston's amazingly
stocked folk scene.
At 10 p.m.,
Kris Delmhnrsr will

start the night off
playing songs that
the Cape Cod Jour
nal says "share a
contagious emo
tional intensity that
picks you up and
takes you along for
the ride." Closing
the show will be the
amazing Jess Klein,
who, by popular de
mand, will be mak
ing her third appear
ance at Gettysburg
in as many years.
Mixx Maga
zine raves of Klein,
calling her "an
evocative, elusive
voice that gets inside
you and won't let
go." The show is
sponsored by the
Coffeehouse (which
always means free
food and coffee),

Women's Center.
The performance is in the
spirit of Saturday's Women's
Conference, in that both Klein
and Delmhorst were featured
on RESPOND, a compilation
CD that benefits a Boston do
mestic violence prevention and
treatment organization of the
same name. The album has
earned over $15,000 for the
shelter and has been featured
in Billboard Magazine and on
MTVandVH-1.
Jess Klein has been qui
etly building a solid and loyal
following over the past two
years touring on her own, with
Voices on the Verge, as well as
with Moxy Fruvous_, The
Nields_, Dan Bern and others.
Since the 1998 self-release of
her debut CD, "Wishes Well
Disguised," she has sold over

5,000 copies oft the stage, gai- learned to play the guitai and
nered thiee Boston Music the fiddle as a vvav to fend oft
Awards nominations and cabin fever_,

Rykodisc and back from tion of true musicianship and
showcasing at the Sundance consistently compelling writing
Film Festival, Klein has al- has earned her the resnect of

ready recorded her new al
bum, which is slated for a late
summer release.
With big label support,
a crop of great new songs and
her great live shows, this
might be your last chance to
catch Jess Klein playing such
an intimate venue _^s the Junc
tion. "If you haven't heard
Jess Klein play, you're doing
yourself a disservice," says the
Boston Phoenix. Do yourself
a service this weekend!
Kris Delmhorst grew up
in Brooklyn studying classical
cello and playing with
folksingers and subway trou
badours on the side. After
leaving New York, fate depos
ited her in a one-room Maine
house in midwinter, where she

i
her fellow artists
and the enthusiastic
support of audi
ences from coast to
coast. As a solo
performer, her
genuine warmth
and infectious en
ergy fill the stage.
In September
of 1998 Delmhorst
released her debut
CD, "Appetite,"
featuring guest per
formances from
Patty Larkin, Jenni
fer Kimball and
Catie Curtis.

Greeted with a
flurry of rave re
views and a Boston
Music Award
Nomination, this
release has ce
mented Kris
Delmhorst's repu
tation as one of the
most exciting and
original of Boston's
many young acous
tic artists. The of
vo
Eagle raves of
"A dynamic vocal-

Berkshtre Delmhorst,
ist and songwriter of immense
power and range, rich, sultry
vocals and swinging rhythms."
Here is another item of
note. After being booked to
play at Gettysburg College to
gether, Klein and Delmhorst
were asked to play together at
The Iron Horse in
Northampton, MA (one of the
greatest folk clubs in the coun
try) and The Paradise in Bos
ton, MA (one of the greatest
rock clubs in the country) as a
co-bill.
Clearly something great is
going to happen in the Junction
this Friday at little old
Gettysburg College. And the
best part: it's free!

Combine injustices
to fight for justice

by J i-nnii Marvmli
GECO Via-Piu-MDbNi
Many of the members of
our Gettysburg College commu
nity are very active in educat
ing others about their causes.
Whether they are environmen
tal concerns, animal rights is
sues, the importance of cultural
diversity or human rights con
cerns, we all have an issue we
focus our attention on; some
thing about the world we'd like
to change. Very rarely, under
special circumstances, are we
allowed to combine these com
mon interests and come to
gether and educate each other
to achieve a common goal. That
is just what happened on our
campus this past Thursday.

John Echohawk, JD, of
the Native American Rights
Fund, was brought to our cam
pus by a variety of different
campus organizations to give
the noontime lecture on Native
American rights issues, and es
pecially how they relate to en
vironmental concerns. During a
brief reception before his lec
ture, Echohawk gave an inter
esting example of how intercon
nected these two issues can re
ally become. He spoke of a Na
tive American tribe on the Colo-

i.ido River who were fighting
foi legislation in oidei to re
move dams along the river that
ait cuirently driving then
salmon species to extinction.
Not only is this salmon species
of concern to the protectors of
wildlife, but also to the protec
tors of human rights, as this
particular species is especially
important to the tribe's culture
and religion.
The Native American
Rights Fund itself does not get
involved in campaigns, but op
erates strictly on a case-by-case
legal basis. However, their
website does provide a few
good links to interested parties
who might wish to join the
campaign to save these fish and
the culture that they are impor
tant to. If you would like to get
involved in this or any other
Native American rights issue,
you can get more information
at the NARF website, http://
www.narf.org/.

So, the next time you
want to get the word out about
a perceived injustice or a de
mand of your cause, think hard
about who else it effects. You
may just find someone to share
the burden and offer insight
that will help you obtain your
objective and broaden your
horizons.

by Anne Schenck
Book Reviewer
John Berendt. Mid
night in the Garden of Good
and Evil: A Savannah Story.
New York: Random House,
1994. 388 pp.
I have to admit the
main reason I picked up
John Berendt's Midnight in
the Garden of Good and Evil
was the photograph on the
front cover, the expression
less face on a statue who
seems to be weighing good
and evil, as the title suggests.
A catchy cover photograph
and a haunting title made me

more going for it than just
the front cover.
Midnight in the Gar
den of Good and Evil is
the true story of the eight
years author John
Berendt spent in the sce
nic southern city of Sa
vannah, Georgia.
Ready and willing
to try almost anything,
Berendt meets up with the
most eccentric of the
town's characters. These
intriguing individuals
mlcude Lady Chabhs, a
black drag queen, and Jim
Williams, an antique
dealer and the owner of
the town's most famous
mansion, and even
Minerva, a superstitious
practitioner of voodoo.

more way to utilize the Career
Center is by visiting its
homepage at
www.gettysburg.edu/career.
The homepage provides infor
mation about all its services, as
well as links to employers seek
ing college students, graduate
schools, job searches, job fairs
and other organizations. Check
it out—and remember, it's
never too early to start planning
for the future!

Berendt's visits with
Lady Chablis and his mid
night escapades with
Minerva alone would
have made quite a story,
but Jim Williams' tale
takes center stage.
Williams' charmed
life as owner of the Mer
cer House falls apart on
May 2, 1982, when shots
pierce the night and Will¬

iams' young friend, Danny,
ends up dead on his carpet.
The question is whether Will
iams was a victim of Danny's
temper and fired in self-de
fense, or whether he is a
cold-blooded murderer.
Berendt doesn't miss a
beat as he follows the inves
tigation, the numerous trials,
and even Williams' efforts to
maintain his normal, if a bit
curious, lifestyle.
Midnight in the Garden
of Good and Evil is an ex¬

traordinary true story.
Berendt, a seasoned writer
with an eye for detail, takes
the reader through the re
markable town of Savannah
and the dark story that lurks
behind its thriving tourism
and classic southern culture.
It is difficult to believe
that Berendt could have
imagined more interesting
and exciting characters, or that
he could have invented a bet
ter story than the one the citi
zens of Savannah told them
selves.

Although Midnight in the
Garden of Good and Evil is
non-fiction, Berendt manages
to incorporate in it all of the
elements of a good novel, from
charming characters and amus
ing situations to suspense and
mystery. A great read!

Scott Grabus has looked
into jobs with several computer

which he will work as a pro

ever, decided on the specific

Still other seniors have
decided against following tra
ditional postgraduation paths.
Dave Gary will do public ser

Lutheran Volunteei Corps, a
non-profit organization that
emphasizes simplified lifestyles
for its staff. He hopes for a

and high school students in
Washington, D.C. After that
experience, he has plans for
graduate school, where he will
either attain his teaching cer
tificate or continue his history
education.
Bill Davidson, too, has
unique intentions. He has ap
plied to the Peace Corps. He
has also considered teaching in
a sub-Saharan village in Africa
after graduation. He may also
get a graduate assistant coach
ing job at a university while he
pursues a teaching degree.
Gettysburg College has _<_i
very respectable employment
rate for its graduates. Of the
1998 graduating class, 69% are
employed full-time, while 32%
attend graduate school; some

people are both employed and

The Career Planning and

will be the day after graduation,
it is safe to assume that all se

BY LIB BY MUS.SELMAN
Dear Libby,
Could the College keep
the libiary open 24 hours on
the weekends? Studying is next
to impossible in the dorms on
weekend nights. Maybe the li
brary could close for a few
hours duiing the week (say 3
a.m.-5 a.m.) and could stay
open all night on weekends. If
this institution views itself as
dedicated to learning and
knowledge then it should know
that a closing time of 10 p.m.
is NOT adequate.
Sincerely, Weekend
Worker

Dear 24x7,
Libby is sympathetic and
knows that the residence halls
are not conducive to study.
This request has come up be
fore. But listen, WW, we are
open Sunday from 10 a.m. un
til Friday night at 10p.m. That
is 132 continuous hours! Out
of a 168 possible hours per
week we are only closed 24.
And you've got to believe
Libby, it isn't easy finding
someone to work all these
hours. Libby asked the Library

director, Robin Wagner, about
this and she replied, "This isn't
our first request of this kind.
But what I hear this student
asking for is not necessarily that
the LIBRARY be open, but that
there is a need for a quiet, safe
place on campus, open after 10
p.m. on Friday and Saturday
nights for serious students to
work. This place doesn't have
to be the Library. In fact there
are other places that come to
mind that are easier to patrol
for safety, would allow food,
portable plug-ins and would be
much better suited for this pur-

Libby also learned that it
is really costly to keep a build
ing as big as the library open
and staffed, and probably not
the best use of resources.
Maybe students who want this
kind of quiet study hall could

so we do pretty well.
Dear Libby,
I would like a taxi ser
vice back to my room please.
Thank you.
Unsigned
Dear Walker,
Security will provide an
escort back to your room if
you are studying after dark in
the library. Contact them at
ext. 6911. The service is avail
able for all students.
Dear Libby,
I think the fourth floor

should have a sky light.
Unsigned
Dear Light Deprived,
There is actually a fifth
floor above the fourth floor so
if we provided a sky light
you'd be looking up at the
mechanical room and the
chiller units. Not a pretty
sight! Libby has learned of
plans for a major construction
project on the fourth floor of
the library this summer, so you
can expect improved lighting
when you return in August.

work with the folks in Student
Life to come up with alterna
tive weekend study space.
Finally, as much as Libby
admires your serious work
ethic, she must remark that she
doesn't like the implication
that this institution is not dedi
cated to facilitating learning.
This is a matter of economics
and scheduling, not a lack of
commitment to knowledge.
Also, if you happened to check
out our nearby colleges includ
ing F &c M, Dickinson and
Bucknell you'd find that their
closing times range from 10
p.m. to . mid-

Dear Libby,
I am writing this com
plaint on Fiiday, Febiuaiy 4.
The most cunent issue of the
Philadelphia Inquirer on dis
play at the libiaiy is the papei
from Febiuaiy 1. Yesteiday the
libiary had the paper fiom Sun
day, January 30 on display. If
you are going to change the pa
pers at all, why not put up to
date ones on the rack?
No signature
Dear Inquiring Mind,
You are right. Delivery of
the Philadelphia Inquirer was
delayed. Thanks for bringing
this to Libby's attention.
The Library had a mail
subscription, so it was always a
few days late. We plan to switch
to a "home delivery" subscrip
tion which, up until this year,
was not available as an option.

Announcement from
Libby: Stumped with your re
search? If you've already tried
your best and don't know where
to go, help is here. The
Library's Research Paper Con
sultation service starts on Mon
day! You'll have to TALK to a
librarian to set up an appoint
ment. That way, they will have
a better sense of what they need
to cover with you. RPCs start
February 21 - April 28. You
must make an appointment at

_fyaitk cmA _QcfrUaif,

The rise in oil costs is prompting discussion on the future of en
ergy, bringing to light questions about 21st century politics as well.
Currently, the Western world depends on oil exports from OPEC coun
tries in the Middle East. These Arab nations are not the closest allies
of most European and North American nations, and thus the OPEC
exports have historically been one of the few trump cards held by Middle
Eastern nations against the United States and Europe.
Recent price leveraging exercised by OPEC emphasizes their in¬

direct control over the U.S. economy. It is im
- portant to realize that within this century, the
majority of the Earth's natural oil will be used
up. The time is rapidly approaching for the in
troduction of a major, long-term replacement for
petroleum.
The internal combustion engine found in au
tomobiles is nearly 100 years old, and is ripe for
retirement. Global warming and ever-increasing
pollution levels in the latter half of the 20th cen
tury are indicators of the significant problems
caused by our dependance on oil. Smokestack
scrubbers, emission controls, cleaner gasoline
and even hybrid engines can only go so far to
ward mopping up environmental damage from
burning oil. Only a widespread switch to a new
energy source can reverse these damaging
trends and end and increasingly dangerous de
pendence on Middle Eastern oil supplies.

Large-scale change from oil to a new en
ergy source will be a difficult task and one that
will only come to pass when the need threatens
the structure of society. Just as Y2K readiness
programs were only begun a few years before
2000, real impetus to introduce a new energy
source will wait until it is economically profitable
for the commercial sector. When the average
consumer needs a car that doesn't run on oil,
they will pay the initially high prices of the new
technology.
If the change is made, the political and
economic importance of the Middle East is likely
to decline as their chief source of income will

evaporate. A major conflict or power shift in the region would be pos

Letters to the Editor

Let the backlash begin
Yes , it is that tune of yeai once
again. It is the time of year when
young freshmen, both male and
female, make the decision of whether
or not the Greek system is right for
them. It is also the time of year when
the Greek backlash begins, complete
with the standard letters and articles
from people who routinely bash the
Greek system without fully understand
ing what it is. In recent issues of The
Gettysburgian, there was a lot of talk
about how Greeks are a poor influence
on campus, a "malignant" tumor, that
needs be expunged at all costs.
The only response that I have to
this particular mentality is that if you
yourself haven't made the decision to
become a Greek, that is fine, but is it
really your place to look down upon a

Privacy violation shocking
If it is accurate (I'm hoping not - no
offense to the author intended),
Nadine Hoffman's article "College
Bookstore loses revenue, seeks solu
tion" is very disturbing. That someone
who is not an employee of IKON or the
Federal Postal Service would even con
sider going into the postal room to look
at anyone's mail for whatever reason is
alarming. It sounds illegal - certainly
unethical. What was he thinking?
Surely there is a "better way to
study the issue of book buying than to
look at the names of students using
online companies"!!! Words fail. It is
incomprehensible. Damien Thaxter_,

Ballentyne's bashing unfair
I' m wilting this lettei in response to
Dan Ballentyne's column, printed in
the February 10 edition oiThe Get
tysbuigian.
I attended the February 7 debate spon
soied by Pi Sigma Alpha and I must say
that I came away seeing no clear win
ner. As always, the three parties argued
passionately for their positions, but I
doubt that many minds were changed
— those who walked into the room as
Democrats, Republicans or Socialists
undoubtedly left the same way.
That said, one should be careful
when taking Mr. Ballentyne's rhetoric
as fair reporting of the facts of the de
bate. In truth, his column was unfair to
many of the persons involved.
Let me begin with the College
Socialists. I felt that they came to the
debate well prepared and ready to let
students know what they stand for.
Unfortunately, the Republicans failed to
treat the Socialists with the respect that
they deserve as a fellow campus party.
In fact, it has been said by at least one

Dickert dishes disparity
Upon reading last week's piece by
Christina Dickert, I discovered
that the only truth in her rather
long rant appears in the first sentence
when she says that the debate took place
on Monday night. After stating this fact,
she delves deeply into the realm of fic
tion. To begin her argument, she attacks
the Republicans for reading "nicely
typed responses" and for only giving the
"correct" answers according to the
party platform. First, Ms. Dickert must
realize that having answers typed in
advance does not mean that the Repub
lican debaters cannot think for them
selves, rather it is evidence that they
were prepared (unlike other groups at

Letters to the Editor, continued

The debate goes on
I run writing in response to
Christina Dickert's Febru
ary 10 column.
1. There were differ
ences of opinion on moral is
sues among the Republican
panelists. Republicans come
to different conclusions based
on their conservative ideology
when they emphasize different
things. She says that we are not
tolerant and yet we allowed
opposing viewpoints to repre
sent us and the conservative
framework. The position first
given by a panelist was in line
with the Republican platform
and then any panelist that did
not agree with that position
was told to find time to make
known their opposition to the
party's position. The Demo
crats did not allow this within
their own ranks.
2. There were not "nicely

typed responses to every type
of question possible," as Ms.
Dickert claims, in the posses
sion of the panelists. Different
people have different strengths
and should capitalize on them
when articulating their views
on the issues. For example, I
am not good at quickly com
ing up with answers because I
tend to think out my answers
through talking or writing.
That is not suited toward a de
bate-type format.
Instead, since we had de
cided, based on our expertise,
what issues we would be the
pi unary respondents for, I
thought about the questions
that I could be asked. Then I
proceeded to think through my
answer and put it in a coherent
form rl"Mf I cnnld read. As I

expected, all of my responses
ht perfectly with the questions
asked.

I must say that I was dis
appointed that the Democrats
could not come up with a dif
ferent way of looking at things
as the Republicans tried to do
with their question: "How is it
that your party can believe that
mothers are intelligent enough
to decide whether or not to kill
their children, but not smart
enough to decide where they
go to school?"
Only someone ill-pre
pared would come to a debate
without a rebuttal of the ex
pected response to their own
questions. So yes, we prepared
rebuttals too. I gave a copy of
what I prepared for myself to
each Republican panelist so
that they would know what I
was going to say.
3. We never provoked
Ms. Dickert in her attacks and
her liberal friends should re
mind her about the hbeial po¬

sition on negative advertising,
since she dedicated a large por
tion of her column to the like.
It seems as if they reminded her
about the "correct answer" on
the issue of school choice be
cause she changed her position
since the debate.
Incidentally, it showed
how well the Republicans did
do because the agenda of the
debate was set by us with the
question previously mentioned.
Just because I prepared (unlike
the Democrats) does not mean
that I have not spent an im
mense amount of my time
thinking through very difficult
issues and coming to some con
clusions unpopular among
many college students. I speak
from the heart and believe I can
make a difference. Yes, this is
idealistic. I do believe that
America's greatest days he
ahead, as I mentioned in the

introduction for the Republi
cans at the debate.
4. Many of Ms. Dickert's
complaints were matters of
style, not substance. She said
"If the politicians would please
look further than the edge of
the podium. ..." Well, first
there was no podium for the
panelists to use. That was a
rhetorical device she claims to
despise.
Secondly, if I was at a
podium it would have been
much easier for me to make eye
contact with more people be
cause of the limited scope of
my positioning at the table and
the uncertainty of whether
Rachel, who was sitting next to
me, could read what I had writ
ten.

As far as eye contact, that
is an issue of style not respect.
Whatever their positions, I re
spected the audience even
when they were disrespectful to
me. I could have responded
quite differently to the audi
ence by complaining about
their conduct, but I chose not
to. Ms. Dickert cannot place
herself in the position of know
ing whom I made eye contact
with as I gave my answers, es
pecially when she was not in
the audience.
I do admit, however, that
I should have looked up more
and been more, not less, pre
pared in that regard. That is
an issue of style that I should
work on for the future. She
also complained that I droned
on about moral responsibilities.
Perhaps I will also work on the
inflection of my voice. She
unfairly attributed my style to
that of the rest of the Republi
can panelists.

5. Yes, part of the respon
sibility of the family is to instill
morals. However, this does not
mean that the school is a moral
free zone, nor should it be.
Without a basic right and
wrong being applied to certain
ideas, our children are going to
learn flawed views of the
world. Hitler was a bad per
son, it is ok to teach children
that. That is only one example
of how morals and education

Dickert

tending the debate).
I think most people
would consider preparation a
virtue, but apparently she sees
it as an unfair advantage over
those who did not care enough
to think out their ideas ahead
of time. In addition to her
warped view of preparation,
she also has a distorted
memory. She claims that the
answers given by Republicans
were always consistent with the
party line and that there was no
room for division or tolerance
of other views within the party.
On this point she seems
to have been stricken with a
slight case of amnesia: one of
the three Republicans, Ted
Hartman, acknowledged in the
debate that he is both pro
choice (a typically Democratic
stance) and that he favors civil
rights for gays.

The above is a case in
point that demonstrates the
acceptance in the Republican
party of an ideological dispar
ity. In fact, if Ms. Dickert is
looking for an example of a
lack of tolerance for other
viewpoints, she need look no
further than her own state
ments. In the debate, when
asked about the idea of a school

continued from page 11

voucher program, Ms. Dickert
herself stepped out of line with
her own party by claiming that
she supports school vouchers,
however in her piece in the
February 10 Gettysburgian, she
rails against school vouchers
for more than three para
graphs.
What inspired the change
of mind in Ms. Dickert? Did
her cohorts, Ms. Hanson and
Mr. Hoover, remind her of the
"correct" answer after the de
bate? Was her divergence from
the party line the reason she
spoke only twice during the
debate, for fear by her fellow

Democrats that she might show
weakness in the party plat
form? After Ms. Pickert's article
finishes its blast on school
vouchers, it goes on to assail
the idea of morals in general.
Apparently she has no morals
and believes that no one should
be taught any at school. She
states in her article: "The teach
ing of 'morals' do not belong
in our schools. In schools, we
teach respect, open
mindedness_, and tolerance. We
do not need the Republicans
pushing their Christian morals
on our children."

Here she is simply con
fused. She is failing to realize
the difference between teach
ing morals in school and teach
ing religion; and yes, there is a
difference. Not one of the Re
publicans at the debate said
anything about teaching reli
gion in school, however they
do support that the education
of our children include some
basic morals. If we do not teach
any morals in school where will
our children receive them?
There are many loving
parents in this country who
make a point to teach their chil
dren about right and wrong,
but, sadly, there are many oth
ers who do not fulfill this pa
rental duty. This is precisely the
reason that morals need to be
taught in school.

Besides, the list of things
Ms. Dickert says should be
taught in school (respect, open
mindedness, and tolerance) all
sound like morals to me. Thus,
she makes an argument and
then contradicts it in the same
paragraph!
Also, as a side note, I am
personally offended by her re
mark about "Republicans push
ing their Christian morals".
Morals are not exclusively

Christian; they also belong to
the belief systems of Judaism,
Islam, and a multitude of other
religions. In fact, I consider
myself to be an agnostic, but
this does not mean I have no
morals. To sum all of this up:
Ms. Dickert must realize that
morals are a basic issue of right
and wrong that almost all hu
mans agree upon; they are not
a purely Christian belief.
Finally, I challenge Ms.
Dickert to write more truth
fully in the future and to prac
tice what she preaches: "re
spect, open-mindedness, and
tolerance" toward view points
that differ from her own. I also
urge her to stand up for her
self. She has no reason to be
embarrassed of her true beliefs
about school vouchers or any
thing else.

If the Democrats do not
want her voicing her opinion
on issues where she does not
follow the party line, the re
spectful, open-minded, and tol
erant college Republicans
would gladly accept her as a
member. We meet on Wednes
day nights at 7:30 in the CUB.

Ballentyne

- continued from page 11 -
Socialism as one and the same.
I suggest to Mr. Ballentyne that
if he still does not understand
the difference between the two,
he take a class on political ide
ologies before he continues to
make untrue statements in re
gard to the Socialist Party.
Next I would like to ad
dress the unfair statements
made by Mr. Ballentyne regard
ing the Democratic partici
pants. He restates a comment
made by one Democrat in ref
erence to people who feel they
should be able to choose their
schools.

It is true that this com
ment was made. However, Mr.
Ballentyne does not mention
that when questioned by an
audience member, the speaker
responded that she regretted
making such a comment and
restated her beliefs on school
choice—that all schools should
be improved but in particular
those with small tax bases. She
explained that these schools are
most in need of new materials,
in particular textbooks, a posi
tion with which none could
disagree. Although her original
comment was unfortunate, I
think she did a good job of ex
plaining herself afterwards.

In addition, Mr.
Ballentyne mentions that there
weie dissenting opinions in
both the Democratic and Re
publican paities, which is true_.
In fact I was impressed with
how nicely balanced the panel
was. However, Mr. Ballentyne
mentions that one Democratic
paiticipant was silenced be-

Repubhcan that the Socialists
should not be included in fu
ture debates because they were
given equal time despite their
small size. As a member of Pi
Sigma Alpha, I am pleased that
the decision was made to in
clude them and I commend
them on a job very well done.
It should be noted that
the Socialists had to spend a
large portion _oi their time de
fending themselves against un
fair charges by the Republicans,
particularly by Mr. Ballentyne.

If Mr. Ballentyne would have
simply listened to Mr. Bnndle
and Mr. Witham, perhaps he
would have learned something.
Let me try this one more
time—Communists and Social
ists are not the same thing. The
USSR and the PRC are/were
Communist countries. Lenin,
Stalin, and Mao were Commu
nists. (And truth be told, their
practices were far from what
Marx and Engels wrote about.
I would hardly even call them
Communist at all.)

As Mr. Brindle pointed
out in a vain attempt to edu
cate Mr. Ballentyne, there are
large Socialist parties in coun
tries all over the world, includ
ing extremely strong parties in
many of our European "ally"
nations. Communism calls for
a revolution, socialism is
achieved through democratic
means (if it is the will of the
people), which was also
pointed out at the debate.
Unfortunately, in his col
umn, Mr. Ballentyne chose to
again treat Communism and

cause of her opinion on school
choice.
I was sitting in the front
row, directly in front of the
Democratic panel and I did not
see any attempt by either Ms.
Hanson or Mr. Hoover to keep
Ms. Dickert from making her
point. In fact, Ms. Dickert was
making the point that, like the
Republicans, Democrats have
all different kinds of opinions.
I fail to see where Mr.
Ballentyne comes by the opin
ion that Ms. Dickert was pur
posely silenced.
Finally, in the interest of
fairness, it is important to note
some of the comments made by
the Republicans that shocked
audience members. Mr. Marple
said that homosexuality is a

chosen situation and that we
can solve our problems by mak
ing sure every child is raised by
a married, heterosexual couple.
Mr. Ballentyne said that it is
okay for the US to renege on
treaties it has signed. And Mr.
Hartman commented that pub
lic school teachers only work
six hours a day and do not
make any attempt to make an
emotional connection with
their students and that if some
one is unemployed that is just
"tough" because there is no
reason to not have a job.
All in all, each party made
mistakes but did a good job
overall. However, I think that
if, in the future, Mr. Ballentyne
wants to name a "winner," he
should get his facts straight.
Miranda Fegley '00

Letters to the Editor, continued

come together.
Some liberals have no
problem saying that should be
taught because it agrees with
their values. It is a value shared
by most Americans and should
be taught in school as such.
Liberals impose their "morals,"
or lack thereof, on public
school children all the time
with condom promoting and
other causes.
They tell children that
"we know you are going to
have sex and you should pro
tect yourself, " brainwashing
them to think it is normal to
have sex in middle and high
school. I also resent the impli
cations that Christianity and
conservatives are not tolerant
or open-minded, but I leave
that issue for another time.
And by the way, they are Judeo
Christian and Muslim morals.

6. It would be very easy
for me to complain about Ms.
Dickert's style. After all, I
counted only two times when
she talked. One time was the
school vouchers issue. And the
other she said that I, Justin,
need to wake up because it is
the year 2000 and the divorce
rate is more than 50 percent.
(I cannot remember another
personal attack by a panelist
against another panelist during
the entire debate.) I could see
many people mouth to them
selves, among different politi
cal parties, "that is an example
of his complaint" and other
similar phrases.
So, I decided that I should
respond when given the
chance. I formulated a re
sponse by thinking it out on
paper and then read it when the
opportunity presented itself. I

said that, "If believing in tradi
tional American values makes
me a reactionary, then I am a
reactionary and proud of it!"
I never said that we
should ignore single parents
and divorced parents, nor im
plied such a thing, but instead
was promoting a way of think
ing that should help reduce the
number of those circumstances
because it is harder on those
parents to raise their children
than a traditional family.
7. You have to have con
trol over your actions to be a

moral person and therefore no
gene can make you behave in a
certain manner. We have free
will. Ms. Dickert should have
listened to my argument in
stead of rejecting it with a
closed mind. Her comment
about "offensive statements"
made by Republicans should
read something like "non-lib
eral." Some of the Republicans
disagree about these issues and
we welcome that discussion
instead of dismissing ideas sim
ply because Ms. Dickert might
he offender!.

8. It is not the 21st Cen
tury yet, unless Ms. Dickert de
cides to redefine a century as
99 years long, which would be
consistent with her tendency to
redefine common sense into
oblivion. Since she makes her
crusade the textbooks children
read from, I feel the need to say
that I would prefer that the
Cold War still be going on in
their history books than for
them to think that Oprah
Winfrey is more important

The Pachyderm's Pulpit
A salute to President Reagan

by John Duni__ap
Political Columnim
This year, as the Repub
lican Party goes about the pro
cess of nominating a candidate
for President of the United
States, a giant figuie looms over

the race. Though this aging
leader's health is in serious de
cline and he is completely out
ot the public spotlight, Ronald
Reagan once temolded the
party and changed the nation.
Just a few weeks ago, the
Great Communicator cel
ebrated his 89th birthday, or as

he would call it, the 50th anni
versary of his 19th bnthday.
The economic giowth we are
experiencing today has been
going on since Piesident
Reagan's economic program
was enacted in 1981. We are
currently witnessing the long
est economic expansion in our

nation's history,
and we have bal
anced the budget
toll owing the
Reagan formula
During the
1980s, revenues
into the federal
government tripled, while
spending soaied.
The reason
spending in
creased was that
Ronald Reagan

wanted to
outspend the Soviet Union and
completely bankrupt their
communist system. Democrats
who controlled the House of
Representatives wanted to con
tinue their big spending ways.
The ensuing compromise
brought us extraordinary
growth and victory in the Cold
War. With that vicfoiy, we
have leduced the rate of
growth in government spend
ing, balanced the budget and
have finally made reforms
called for by Ronald Reagan.
Today, welfare reform has been
implemented, as well as' a line
item veto because a Republican
Congress and President
Clinton, who can not govern as
a liberal in the post Reagan
presidency, have conceded that
Reaganite policies and pro
grams are the answer.

Upon entering office,
President Reagan inherited a
nation that went through Viet
nam, Watergate and Jimmy
Carter's "days of malaise." The
United States was held hostage
in Iran, the Soviets were on the
march in Afghanistan, and the
country had not seemed right
since the Kennedy assassina
tion. Reagan was a lifelong
actor, born in Illinois, who
moved to California to pursue
his career.
He was not a career poli
tician; the only political office
he held before the presidency
was governor of California , In
1976, he took on the Republi
can establishment and nearly
toppled a sitting president,
Gerald Ford, and in 1980 he

led a revolution which prom
ised to restore the American
dream.
As President he gave us
the largest tax cut in history be
cause he trusted the people, not
the government. He knew the
Soviet Union was dying and
was against the decade of ap
peasement that preceded his
presidency. Reagan wanted to
speed up the communists' de
cline, and he succeeded. SDI
scared the Soviets and even to
day the Clinton Administration
and liberals are finally seeing its
merits and supporting it before
Congress.
Reagan increased defense
spending and began aiding anti
Communist freedom fighters
around the world. He made
the Cold War a moral crusade
to free the millions of people
enslaved by communism and
called the Soviets what they
were, "an evil empire."

In 1983, he defended our
democratic line in the Ameri
cas by liberating Grenada from
Soviet-inspired aggression and
showed the American military
was back from Vietnam. Lib
erals and intellectuals shud
dered, but by 1985 a reformer
became leader of the Soviet
Union. Ronald Reagan worked
with Mikhail Gorbachev to re
duce arms and expand capital
ism. By the time he left office,
the Cold War was in a dramatic
thaw. Within months, commu
nism collapsed in Eastern Eu
rope, and in 1991 the Soviet
Union itself died.

This Side of Cynicism
The Plague To End All and Personal Reflection

by Ian Lsherwood
Social Commentator
Now that I am winding
down the long road to gradua
tion in my second semester of
my last year, I have found that
recently nostalgic thoughts
have made me a mere she!! of
the bombastic youth I once
was. As I sat dow n to meet my
deadline, I realized that I had
nothing of significance to really

bitch about. My columns have
become surprisingly tame
and my words more sym- _^
pathetic than I would _^M
like. I actually have to _^^
search out and beat _^^^
the same issues into _^^^^H
submission so I feel, _^^^_JD
at the very least, _^^H_^H
socially con- _^^^^fi_^BI
scious. I hope
that this recent personal lull of
optimism doesn't impair my
duties to this fine publication.
Well, let me see what I can dig
out. I would have written on

the Greek issue of Sophomore
Rush, but I am so sick of the
subject that giving st more press
would do no justice to what has
been a well thought out plan
and a silly half-assed attempt to
thwart it. I suppose that I could
bitch about bidding, and with
it the senseless singing of stu
pid little songs by women who
were so lucky to be chosen for
membership at the cost of their
former friends' tears. That too
has been written upon by more
prolific writers than little old
me. I could tackle fashion, but
as of yet I can't bear to wear

any North Face gear for a test
trial and I think that
Abercrombie was best as a shot
gun and tackle supply shop. So
I am left hopelessly behind in
the college market and with
nothing to talk about.
There is one issue dearer
to any of our hearts than all the
fleece in the world, and that is
our own blessed, God-given
health and well being. Has any
one no- ticed the
_^M_^M_^Mmffles

"and the coughs of their fellow
classmates? Well, for those of
you who weren't busy sleeping
through your lectures, this
campus is in the middle of yet
another epidemic season of in
fluenza, bronchitis, and pneu
monia that I am convinced are
all misdiagnosed variant forms
of the plague.
Oh yes, if'the average
fourteenth-century friar
thought his job was bad, just
wait until you hear what the
health center people have to
say about the hundreds of
people who have come already
with crackly chests and swol
len glands. We soon will needs
carts for calling on the dead or
dying on campus, and that is
not a pleasant job for house
keeping, I can tell you.
So how can we defend

ourselves from such a nasty
little disorder? Well, 1 frankly
don't think it is possible, how
ever I would not rule out the
option of ritual procession or
the flogging of oneself with
sharp little branches. Probably
the best way to avoid this para
lyzing disease is to avoid those
who are stricken like they have
- well, for lack of a bettei term
- the plague. First of all, even
though they are _youi _filends,
they deseive your abandon
ment because they must have
. done something to deserve
_L it. Secondly, since you are
_^k not afflicted, they must

have done that some
thing to you and you
i probably don't know
k it yet. So, in reality,
™ they deserve it. Per¬

haps marking their doors with
sheep's blood would be a good
idea, but that is even too nos
talgic for me.
In my studies on epidemi
ology, I have learned a thing or
two from old "Typhoid Mary."
My own field experiments have
shown that our current plague
was started by one skinny and
sickly man who brought it to
campus from somewhere near
Hershey, Pennsylvania. Oh yes,
my friends, the sweetest town
on earth now has the sweet
stench of plague as our own
"typhoid Mary" has caused an
epidemic. I leave it up to you
whether we should decide his
fate, or whether he should be
forced to hide in a castle of his
own creation. Let us see if you
can figure out my little riddle.
Whoever does gets a Hershey's
Kiss (if you dare)!

From the Donkey's Mouth
Women should not fear feminism

by Christina Dickert
Political Columnist
I expect insensitivity
from men about feminism. As
a woman, it is just something
that you get used to. For years,
men have been making the
same wise cracks. "Why isn't
there a Men's Conference?"
"Why isn't there a Men's Cen
ter ?" This is not the real issue
at hand. The issue is that I, like
other women, have become
used to derogatory comments
from men about things con
cerning women. What I did
not expect was to hear those
comments coming from an
other woman's mouth.
During my three years

at Gettysburg College, I
have heard some wild things
said by women about the
women's movement. This in
cludes a woman in one of my §
classes who concluded that
she did not have an opinion
on whether the United States
should provide childcare for
working mothers because she
was going to become a stay-at
home mom when she finished
school. (While I have no prob
lem with the idea of being a
stay-at-home mother, I also do
not believe that a woman
should dismiss the idea of state
provided childcare when other
women do not have the luxury
of staying at home and have to
work.)

I have heard women call
another woman "feminazi" be
cause they thought that a
woman being vocal about pro
tecting her rights was out of
line. The most defining phe
nomenon that I have witnessed
on this campus is the blatant
fear some women have when
it comes to calling themselves
a feminist.
Earlier this week, I was
sitting in a meeting where
people were talking about their
plans for the weekend. As the
conversation continued, one
woman said that she was going

to a conference that was spon
sored by a women's religious
group on campus. When the
only man in the group asked,
with the usual raised eyebrows,
" A women's group?," the
woman quickly added, "No,
it's not a feminist group or any
thing like that." I was so
shocked that I could not find
the words to express myself.
Many women shy away
from attending Learning
Lunches at the Women's Cen
ter or going to the Women's
Conference because they dis
miss these things as "feminist

gatherings." Why has
feminism gotten such
a bad name? Are
the images of _^

_wfr If Wds
Fi it a n d
4 V la* 1970s
^^ _^ so dis¬
turbing that people have to
avoid the feminist topic at all
costs? I think not.
The earliest American
feminist movements date all the
way back to the 19th century
with women's rights leaders
like Lucretia Mott and Eliza
beth Cady Stanton. Without
these women, women would
not be able to vote or attend
the school of their choice.
Women would still be under
the control of men.

A major point against the
education of women or their
enfranchisement was that a
woman really did not have to
think. They had a man to do
that. Their lives were ruled by
men — at first, their father,
then when they married, their
husband, and if they became a
widow, a son was the only one
who could inherit the father's
wealth, and so the woman be
came dependent upon her son
Through her life, a
woman was never without the
supervision of a man. She was
constantly told that the man's

view was the conect view, and
many believed that women just
could not think for themselves.
That is because these women
were never given the chance.
When you think about it,
women were only recently
given the right to choose, in
1920 when women gained the
right to vote. Yes, that was 70
years ago, but look at it in ret
rospect. The United States has
been around for 224 years.
Women have been repressed
for almost 2/3 of that time.
And we still have not been com¬

pletely liberated.
A woman still make 75
cents to a man's dollar.
Women still have to live in
fear of being abused by a sig
fci nificant other. I can go on
™ and on with examples of
how women are still not equal
to men, but I think that you
would get bored. My point is
that some women do not real
ize that things can still get bet
ter. Yes, in comparison to
where women were in 1900,
women have come a long way.
But we can still go further.

So, women of Gettysburg
College, I encourage you to
stop believing that the status
quo is fine. Stop refusing to
identify with a feminist cause.
You are a woman. That auto
matically makes you pro
woman. That is exactly what
a feminist is.
There are different vari
eties of feminism that encom
pass all sorts of views. Find the
one that is right for you, and
stick to it. Do not be intimi
dated by the derogatory com
ments that are made on this
campus, in this country, and
around the world about the
feminist cause.
If the first American femi
nists had done that, we would
not be worrying about who to
vote for in the upcoming elec
tion— a man would vote for us
instead. And most probably,
you would not be reading this
article because neither you nor
I would be at this institution.
Think about that for a minute.

Reagan

- continued from page 14 -
Reagan showed strength and
determination. In 198 1 he
showed he meant business by
firing illegally striking air tiaf
fic controllers despite the fact
that their union endorsed him
for president. Reagan did what
was right, not what was politi
cally expedient and his accom
plishments are immense.
He saved social security
along with the bipartisan con
gressional leadership in 1983,
he reformed the tax code in his
second term, the post office
was privatized to make it more
competitive, he enacted a free
trade agreement with Canada
and saved the Harley-Davidson

company from Japanese com
petition. In the war on crime
and drugs he successfully de
manded that Congress abolish
parole on the federal level, and
with his wife, Nancy, he
launched a national Just Say No
campaign against drugs which
has saved thousands of lives.
The American people re
warded this great leader with a
49-state landslide in 1984 and
by electing his vice president,
George Bush, President in
1988. The Reagan record is
not perfect: there was Iran
Contra where he was accused
of selling arms for hostages and
illegally arming the Nicaraguan
freedom fighters. Let's put this

per
spective. Unlike Watergate
which was for political gain,
and the Monica Lewinsky af
fair which was for personal
gain, Iran-Contra's purpose
was to save lives. Hostages
were freed, and today, Nicara
gua is free.
On the political side,
Ronald Reagan changed the
American landscape. When
First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton announced she was
running for the United States
Senate in New York, she pro
claimed herself to be a "New
Democrat." In 1992, Bill and
Hillary Clinton had to move
the Democratic Party to the
right because President Reagan
moved the nation to the right.
He not only changed his party,
but the opposition party as
well, a great compliment to a
wonderful man.

I am a Republican today
because of Ronald Reagan. In
the midst of the current dis
grace that exists in the White
House, we can looking fondly
back to the time when Presi
dent and Mrs. Reagan upheld
the dignity and honor of the
White House and the Oval Of
fice. Thank you, and happy
birthday, President Reagan.

than George Washington or,
better yet think that we were
on the wrong side in the fight
for freedom and against tyr
anny and oppression.
And by the way, just in
case you were wondering, the
only tune a political group
tries to spin that they are not
going to claim victory in a
debate it is because they can¬

not do so. Usually there is
enough similarity between
the performances of the dif
ferent organizations that they
can at least claim to have
won. The Democrats' poor
showing was not good
enough to even lie about, or
at least misrepresent, as she
did nearly everything else.

From the Conservative Corner
The Case for Alan Keyes

by Dan Ballentyne
Columnist
After much deliberation,
I have concluded that Ambas
sador Alan Keyes is the best
choice for President in 2000.
His has the right message for
dealing with the problems as
we go into the 21st Century (it
is still the 20th century). He
has correctly identified the
problems facing America to
day: moral decay, government
encroachment of our God
given rights, and general
American decline at home and
abroad.
Alan Keyes is the sole
candidate in both parties mak¬

ing a serious issue of American
moral decline. He is leading
the charge against the crime of
abortion, which has killed 35
million innocent American ba
bies. He is fighting the radical
homosexual agenda to prevent
the granting of special rights to
people based on behavior, and
immoral behavior at that. He
is fighting for the two-parent
family, which history, every
study and plain common sense
all say works.
Alan Keyes has a basic
philosophy of government: our
rights, as expressed in the Dec
laration of Independence,
come from God and are pro
tected by the Constitution.
That means freedom of reli¬

gion, not from religion, as the
left has been preaching. Alan
Keyes wants to return volun
tary prayer to our schools and
place those schools back under
the control of those who
should control them, parents
and teachers.
The Ambassador also
wants to give parents the op
portunity to decide where their
children go to school, thus en
abling them to choose a school
that reflects their values and
not the liberal non-values
forced on them by Washington.
Alan Keyes supports the
Second Amendment. He un
derstands why the Founding
Fathers put that amendment in:
so the citizens could protect

themselves from a government
gone wild. He understands
why every dictator in the twen
tieth century began by collect
ing the guns: an armed citi
zenry is the safest way to en
sure a free people. The Am
bassador seeks to ensure that
our basic rights remain un
abridged because he realizes
that if you take one right away,
all rights are then in jeopardy.
In the area of foreign
policy, Ambassador Keyes is
clearly the most qualified. He
has served as the Assistant Sec
retary of State for International
Organizations and the United
Nations Social and Economic
Council. While there, he par
ticipated in the making of

foreign policy and saw first
hand how international politics
work. This experience alone
is greater than any possessed by
his opponents in both parties.
The Ambassador also has
a foreign policy based on
American principles and
American sovereignty. He
plans to end the Clinton col
lective bargaining-based free
trade policy that has devastated
American manufacturing jobs
(union jobs for you Demo
crats), and replace it with a fair
trade policy based on mutual
opening of markets. To facili
tate this, he advocates with
drawal from the WTO, which
meets in secret and says it can,
as an unelected body, override
the laws of sovereign states
with elected legislatures.

Keyes will reassert Ameri
can sovereignty. He will allow
no U.S. troops to be under UN
command. He will resist the
growing desire of international
organizations to interfere with
the internal affairs of sovereign
nations. He firmly supports the
role of the Constitution as the
law of the land, and will not
let any foreign influence over
ride it.
For these reasons, and
many others, Alan Keyes is the
best choice for President. He
is the most vocal voice for all
Americans, including the un
born. He supports the Consti
tution, and will not ignore parts
of it that do not suit him. He
has an America First foreign
policy that is the duty of the
government to pursue. His
message is right on target.

Correction
I would like to correct a
mistake I made in my column
last week. One member of our
panel was not selected because
of his differing viewpoint, but
because of his debating ability
and experience. I was trying
to show that the Republican
Party is a "big tent" and does
not silence dissenting view
points and I did a very poor job.
1 apologize for anyone I may
have offended due to this mis
take.

A room of one's own: an essential concept

From the Feminist Front

by Rachel Hanson
Columnist
Perhaps one of the most
vital tenets of feminism is un
derstanding the importance oi
and need for "women's
spaces." They are one of the
most enduring and significant
aspects of most women's lives.
Women's spaces have ex
isted since the beginning of
time. They have taken form as
sewing groups, church groups,
women's colleges, sororities,
and, most recently, feminist
organizations. They are also
evident in less structured set
tings as women doing laundry
together, caring for children
together, sisterhood and female
friendship.

The benefits of women
only organizations and settings
are numerous. Women are
given leadership opportunities
and make all decisions regard
ing the operation and structure
of their groups. They are also
able to form networks with
women similar to them, a ben
efit that often proves to be in
valuable in life. They are also
able to speak their minds with¬

out worrying about trying to
impress men or fighting off the
advances of men.
I think that with all the
negative connotations associ
ated with the term "feminist"
today, young women forget
about their involvement with
organizations that were the ba
sis of the women's movement
and feminism. I also think that
the significance of these insti
tutions and relationships are
wrongfully downplayed and
characterized by society as

frivolous and senseless.
Approximately 40 per
cent of Gettysburg College
women are members of one of
the most basic examples of
women's spaces -?- sororities.
I will be the first to admit that
there are a lot of problems in
all Greek systems and that there
are many things that should be
changed tn order to make the
experiences of their members
better. However, I will also
readily admit that there are
many things to be gained by
sorority women.

As all-women organiza
tions, sororities offer their
members a number of different
ways to improve upon their

leadership skills. Women are
in charge of every aspect of
sororities and this gives women
leadership opportunities that
they often would have diffi
culty getting in mixed-sex
groups.
Sororities also foster
close bonds between women,
bonds that often prove to be
basic to the relationships in
women's lives. Throughout
history, women have relied
upon other women for support,
guidance and companionship.
Sorority sisterhood is a won
derful stepping-off place for
these relationships.
The fact that the
Women's Conference is open
only to women has recently
been questioned and even criti
cized by some. While it may
be true that "there are no is
sues that are only women's is
sues," there are some things the
Women's Conference includes
which should be left for female
participation only.

There are a number of
topics discussed at the Confer
ence that many women would
not feel comfortable discussing
in front of their male peers.
This would make women less

willing to actively participate in
the Conference, something
which would detract from the
benefits of participating in such
an event.
Finally, I think that
women's friendships are not
given nearly enough credit for
benefiting women and improv
ing their lives. Many see
women's friendships as only
having limited purposes: gos
sip partners, shopping buddies,
etc. However, friendships and
bonds with other women have
helped women through all the
changes and stages in their lives

- from marriage to childbirth
to dealing with abusive hus
bands to even simple day-to
day companionship and sup
port. They have often been the
only long-lasting and signifi
cant relationships in women's
lives. Regardless of your views
on feminism, it is very impor
tant to remember the great sig
nificance of women-only orga
nizations and spaces. They
should not be forgotten about
or deemed trivial. Indeed, they
have played an extremely im
portant role in women's lives
throughout history.





Lady Bullets' playoff hopes dashed

Gettysburg
From Staff Rfj-ori-s
The Bullets went 0-2
over the past week, watching
their hopes of a Centennial
Conference playoff berth van
ish in the process.
Gettysburg entered
Saturday's game at Western
Maryland two games behind
Franklin & Marshall for sec
ond place. Before the game,
Getysburg's three seniors -
Carrie Kulp, Megan
McDonald, and Jamie Dawson
- were recognized.
Kulp scored 2J points
and pulled down 11 rebounds
for Gettysburg to record her
third double-doubie and fifth
20-plus point game of the sea
son, but it was not enough as
the Bullets fell to the Green
Terror 59-56.

Dawson added 10 points
and eight rebounds for the
Bullets while fellow senior
McDonald hauled in 11
boards.
Gettysburg took the lead
10-8 with 13:27 left in the first
half after sophomore Steph
Drevna nailed a jumper.
But Western Maryland
answered with an 11-2 run
over the next four minutes and
10 seconds to take a 19-12 lead

eliminated from conference run after 59-56 loss to Western Maryland

and would never trad again.
The Bullets cut the lead
to 25-22 with 3:34 left, but the
Green Terror closed out the
half on a 7-1 run to take a 32
23 lead into the locker room.
Gettysburg pulled within
six at 44-38 with 11:08 left in
the game on a iayup by Jay
Hodge, but Western Maryland
answered with a 6-0 run to take
control of the contest and
cruise to the win.
Mandy Wilson pulled
down six rebounds and added
five steals for the Bullets, who
wrapped up their 1999-2000
home season with a 9-4 record
at Bream Gymnasium.
Gettysburg traveled to
Annville Tuesday night to face
Lebanon Valley College in non
conference action. The Flying
Dutchwomen were sparked by
several brilliant performances,
enroute to a 76-54 drubbing of
Gettysburg.

Drevna led the Bullets
with 16 points and six re
bounds. Sophomore Katie
Havens added nine points and
10 rebounds off the bench,
while freshman center Cory
Dallas blocked a career-high
five shots in just 14 minutes.

Bullets shoot down Royals

poised to take CC crown

by Richard Lukas
Staff Wri _rtR
Last Saturday the Gettys
burg wrestling team faced off
against Scranton in a non-con
ference meet. The Bullet wres
tlers walked away with a 33
12 victory over the Scranton
Royals.
Sophomore Chris
Clemente (125) started the
Bullets on their way to victory,
winning by a forfeit. Andrew
" I ain't a gentleman" Buck
(149) routed Mike LeTang m
an 8-6 overtime decision. One
spectator remarked, "It was
going to take something spe
cial to get a win past this wres¬

tler [Buck], and overtimes aie
never easy."
Sophomore Tim Scrapato
(157) defeated Matt Borella in
a commanding 10-5 decision.
But the outcome of the match
was still uncertain. The score
was tied 1212 with four
matches to go.
Beginning with Senior
Chris Beck, the Bullets allowed
the Royals no respite. Beck
(174) won by fall against joe
Marro in 1:08, finishing the
season with an extraordinary
12 pins.
Morgan "the Kid" Dou
glas (184) followed with a
dominating 10-3 decision over
Kyle Beasley.
Freshman Brandon Smith

(197), who has wrestled with
maturity throughout the sea
son, pinned A.J. Capno in
1:27. Right at Beck's heels,
Smith mustered his tenth pin
of season. With no chance of
a comeback, senior Shawn

Last week the men's basketball
team was still in the hunt for a Cen
tennial Conference Playoff spot. But
after losing last Wednesday at F&M,
their chance was virtually eliminated.
Despite a Bullet win over West
ern Maryland on Saturday, both Johns
Hopkins and F&cM won their games
and eliminated the Bullets from the
playoff picture.
The week started with an impor
tant game versus Franklin and
Marshall. Gettysburg dropped the
game 82-81 in overtime, falling in a
fashion similar to that which carried
them past Dickinson two weeks ear

with the game early. A 21-2 run dur
ing the middle of the first half put the
Diplomats ahead 36-17 with 4:23 re
maining before _halftime.
The Bullets answered with a run
of their own to close the deficit to 41
29 at halftime.

Gettysburg trailed by as many as
15 points in the second half, but
Curtis McNeill hit a three pointer to
tie the game 68-68 with 51 seconds
remaining.
The game then went into over
time. After a three pointer by F&cM's
MikeRitacco, the Bullets went on an
11-0 run.
The Bullets then led the Diplo
mats 81-79 before the final posses
sion, in which Alex Craft hit a lean
ing 35-footer at the buzzer, handing
