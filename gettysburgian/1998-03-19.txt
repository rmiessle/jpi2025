False bomb threat paralyzes Glatfelter Hall
Horrible hoax has bounds hunting

by Keith Davis
Staff Reporter

Onlookers watch as Glatfelter Hall is closed during yesterday's phoney
bomb threat.

Glatfelter hall was the target of a
false bomb threat shortly before noon
yesterday, causing an immediate evacu
ation of the building.
Safety and Security and the
Gettysburg Borough Police immediately
responded to the computer generated
threat. Police barriers were put in place
and the building was closed off. A quali
fied bomb locating team from Frederick
Maryland brought in three K-9 units to
sweep the building in search of a bomb,
but only one dog was used to search
the premises. No explosive device was
found.
Director of Safety and Security
Operations Timon Linn was in charge
of the crime scene and is leading the
pending investigation.
It is not yet known who made the
threat or why but it has been established
that is was computer generated. The
threat has caused much frustration for
professors and students.
The building was completely
evacuated by 12 noon. Classes were
canceled for the afternoon and there

was uncertainty about when Glatfelter
would re-open. According to Linn the
plan was to sweep building and secur
ing its safety. At that point Glatfelter
was to be re-opened.
By 6:30 p.m., the building, one
of the oldest and most distinguished on
campus, reopened.
This threat was not the first bomb
threat in Gettysburg history, the most
recent being a threat made to Brua Hall
drung the 1994-1995 accademic year.
According- to Provost Dan
DeNicola, the threat did not make any
specific reference to any individual,

out explaining the situation and dispel
ling rumors.
DeNicola sent an announcement
stating: "this is, of course, a serious
matter even if it proves to be a hoax, as
we expect. Making a bomb threat cre
ates a significant disruption to the aca
demic life of the College; it is a viola
tion of the Student Conduct Code and
it is a serious crime under the Pennsyl
vania criminal statutes."
Denicola urged anyone with any
information concerning the identity of
the threatener to contact either Dean
Julie Ramsey or the Office of Safety and
Security.
Professor R.L. Patterson ex
pressed his frustrations about the situa
tion, "I think it is unproductive and
disruptive. This is a very serious threat...
they [the perpetrator] can spend some
time in the cross bar motel."
Patterson also mentioned the cost
and the inconvenience of having to pay
a qualified bomb team for their services.
Others had more safety concerns.

"If there were a bomb of some
consequence, you would have hoped
they would evacuate Mcreary, Penn
Hall, and White House," a student said.
The investigation into the com
puter generated threat continues.
Michael Martys, the Vice Provost for
Information Resources and Director of
Computing was consulted on the mat
ter. The college computer system has
the ability to track and monitor some
activity on the network. There is a lim
ited record of who logs onto certain

group, department, or cause. This fact "Once they get here; it's a big
corroborated the general feeling of the building," Linn said in reference to
administration and investigators that speculated times for re-opening_,
the threat was a hoax. Campus wide emails were sent

Peterson pleads guilty to manslaughter
Former student to testify against high school sweetheart

by Dan Larkin
News Editor
Former Gettysburg Col
lege student, Brian Peterson,
pleaded guilty to manslaughter
charges early last week, and
agreed to testify against his
high school sweetheart, Amy
Grossberg.
In October of 1996,
Peterson, a First Year Student,
and Grossberg, also a first year
student at the University of
Delaware, were accused of

murdering their newborn son
in a motel room in Delaware.
The officer of the medi
cal examiner stated that the
infant died of shaking, and
multiple skull fractures.
Two weeks ago,
Grossberg's attorneys asked for
a separate trial from Peterson,
and asked to introduce new
evidence blaming him for the
death of the infant.
Her attorneys claimed
that polygraph tests show that
Grossberg never saw the baby,

and thought that she had a mis
carriage. This claim, if true,
would place all criminal re
sponsibility on Peterson.
According to Peterson's
Lawyer, Russell Gioiella,
Peterson believed the infant to
be stillborn and put it in the
motel trash bin in a trash bag
per Grossberg's orders.
Gioiella told reporters
that "Brian has explained at
great length the infant didn't
show any signs of life." "Brian
had no intent to harm the baby
in any way," he said.
"Brian is not anyone's
adversary," Gioiella told re
porters, "He has a duty to tes
tify truthfully."
Peterson answered "yes,
sir," to J udge Henry duPont

Ridgely's question if he under
stood the consequences of his
guilty plea.
Grossberg's trial is cur
rently set for May 4.
The two students, both
19, are both white and from the
wealthy New Jersey suburb of
Wyckoff. The claim has been
made that the large amount of
attention given to the case has
to do with the teens' wealth
and race.
They have been living at
home with their families, moni
tored electronically. Both were
set free on $300,000 bail.
Grossberg's lawyer, Rob
ert Tanebaum said that he was
not surprised by the plea, and
claimed that "it doesn't change
our strategy at all."

Speaker to discuss
healing racism

GCPR Nathan Rutstein, an ac
claimed writer and advocate of
human rights issues, will come
to Gettysburg College on
Thursday, march 26, to offer a
lecture and workshop on
"Healing Racism." His presen
tation will begin at 11:30 a.m.
in the College union Building
and is open to the public free
of charge.
Rutstein's latest book,
"Racism: Unraveling the Fear,"
has been called a "brutally hon
est portrayal of racism that of
fers a solution and does no
leave us with hopelessness." He
is the author of 11 other books,
including "Healing Racism in
America: A Prescription for the
Disease In addition, Rutstein is

founder of the more than 200
North American chapters of
the Institutes for the Healing
of Racism. He has championed
ethnic diversity in higher edu
cation as a guest lecturer at col
leges around the country and
has produced ten films, includ
ing "Black and White in Spring
field, Massachusetts," and
"Finding a Solution."
In his speeches and
books, rutstein not only ex
poses racism's roots, its nature,
and how it affects humankind,
he also offers a workable solu
tion to a grave social challenge
that many people believe can
never be resolved. More than
just a prejudice, Rutstein sug
gests that racism is a form of
prejudice that has evolved into
an obsessive psychological dis
order that deeply arfects per
petrator and target alike.

Silly rabbit, cartoons aren't for kids!
Recent cartoons have become directed towards a more mature audience

by Cara Masucci
Staff Reporter It seems as though car
toons have become more and
more popular in mainstream
society. Cartoons have been
around for what seems like for
ever, but many things about
them have changed. Cartoons
are typically thought to be for
kids and to deal with issues
prevalent to childhood. Lately
though, this has changed dra
matically, and cartoons have

begun to move into adult tele
vision.
Most of us have fond rec
ollections of the cartoons we
watched after preschool or
when the babysitter was over.
Most people our age are famil
iar with Thunder Cats, The
Smurfs, and Scooby-Doo as
popular cartoon characters. As
time has progressed however,
these cartoons seem to set a
backdrop for several cartoons
that have become quite popu
lar in the last few years.

The Simpsons, South
Park, Dana, Beavis and Butt
head, and a whole slew of adult
directed cartoons have drawn
a cult-hke following from much
older age groups including the
important 18 to 34 category.
Part of this is due to the nature
of the material addressed in the
cartoons, which is linked to
older age groups because of
their ability to relate to it and
better understand it.
It appears as though the

dawning of what can affection
ately be called the Cartoon Era
got its start with Fox's show
The Simpsons. The Simpsons
is set in Springfield (state un
known) and offers a satirical
look into an American family
and the American way of life.
Its sarcastic qualities
drew unsupportive press when
the show first aired; critics had
problems with the under
achiever status of liart, the
family's son and major cult fig
ure of the early 90's. Many

parents felt that the subject
matter would have a bad influ
ence upon how their children
worked and behaved, particu
larly in the area of school.
According to avid watch
ers of the show, part of the rea
son the show is so funny is be
cause of the way in which it
mocks what are considered to
be American ideals of the
tough and hard-working. The

It's a '
fa r

cry from the older generation
of family shows like Leave It
to Beaver.
Despite the original ad
verse press, The Simpsons has
become quite popular among
all age groups, ranging from
pre-adolescents to college age
kids. Fox schedules the show
during prime time on Sunday
evenings at 8 o'clock, which is
considered one of the most
desirable time slots on televi
sion. It also shows re-runs a
couple of times a day.
A cult-hke following sur
rounds the show with many
people now displaying their
love for it through everything
from wearing Simpsons r-shirts
to thousands of web pages on
the Internet devoted solely to
the cartoon.
Since The Simpsons has

become popular, many other
networks have developed car
toons, following Fox's lead.
One particular network and
show is Cartoon Central's
South Park. Created a little over
half a year ago, South Park has
grown to cult status in what
seems like seconds.
Set in a small Colorado
town and starring four third
graders, the show deals with

older subject material in much
the same way as The Simpsons.
It plays on the stereotypes of
society in a very politically in
correct nature.
Everything from the dif
ficulties of dealing with parents
to the inability of lawmakers to
do their job is addressed in the
show. The kids, though vulgar
and crude, have an innocent
quality about them that allows
older viewers to relate to the
age group.
What is different about
South Park, in comparison to
The Simpsons, is that South Park
carries a TV-MA rating which
tells the viewer that the subject
material is of a mature nature
and deals with adult issues. The
mature subject matter does not
appear to dissuade young view
ers, according to an article in

Newsweek, which states that
23% of South Park viewers are
under 18.
The remaining percent
age of people watching South
Park help the undereighteen
category by contributing to the
5.2 million viewers that
watched South Park during
sweeps week. Like The
Simpsons, many web sites have
also been developed in homage

t o
South Park and i t s
char
a c -
ters.
A c -
cord
mgly,
t
shirt
sales
have
grosed
more than
$ 3 0
mil
lion dol
lars.

South Park is not immune
to controversy, though. Re
cently the show and its adult
subject matter have prompted
an elementary school in Can
ton, Georgia, to ban any t-slurts
or apparel worn with South
Park on them. The principal
who made the decision to pro
hibit South Park did so because
he felt it was unsuitable for el
ementary school students.
In fact, the creators of
South Park have even been as
serting that the show is not in
tended for that age group.
They have maintained this
point in stating that the show
airs at 10 o'clock, when parents
are around to monitor and dis
cuss inappropriate subjects.
For students at
Gettysburg College, the mature
rating of the show does not

seem to dissuade them. Almost
everyone questioned agreed
with first year student Matt
Griffin in how much they like
the show. Griffin even went on
to state that he is a devoted
watcher of both South Park and
The Simpsons.
First year student Liz
Bauerlein commented that
"[South Park] allows you to
laugh and have fun without in
volving much thinking." She
went on to state that sometimes
with her busy schedule she just
wants to kick back and relax
without the worry of what test
she has tomorrow. South Park
allows her to do this.
Most students asked on
campus rated their favorite car
toon to be The Simpsons. The
Sunday night slot allows one
more break before, having to
-crack down for a week of
studying.

Other popular cartoons
on campus range from MTV's
Dana to Scooby-Doo. Dana,
a cartoon that tells the story of
high school from a girl who
sees herself as constantly mis
understood and almost lost in
the world around her really hits
home for many people. Her
awkwardness makes her a char
acter one can relate to. Senior
Jaime Foanio even stated that
Dana is one cartoon she makes
time for in her busy schedule.
"It's one of the best cartoons
out there."
It seems that cartoons
grow more popular by the sec
ond. The large mass of car
toons aimed at older age
groups and material in child
hood cartoons that make it ap
pealing to the viewer makes
cartoons a booming industry
nationwide.

They allow a good time
and an escape from what can
seem like the monotony of
American life. For college stu
dents, especially those here at
Gettysburg, it offers a time to
relax from the pressures of aca
demic life.

Yeah, I can't remember
the last time I've enjoyed
Nicholson this much. Even his
more memorable roles in recent
years (Batman, A Few Good
Men) _jvere instances of Jack
playing himself. But here he
shines, allowing himself to de
velop a well-rounded character
who is equally crass and vulner
able. This movie stars
Nicholson (Wolf, The Two
Jakes) as Melvin Udall, an ob¬

sessive compulsive and best
selling author. Melvin is ob
sessed with cleanliness, avoids
stepping on cracks in the side
walk, and has to eat in the same
restaurant everyday. Melvin is
a bigoted, opinionated jerk.
This fire is fueled by the
fact that he lives across the hall
from Simon Bishop, a gay art
ist, played by Greg Kinnear
(Blankman, Talk Soup). Fur
ther compound this with Frank
Sachs, played by Cuba
Gooding Jr. (Lightning Jack,
Judgement Night) and one pid
dling but adorable dog and you
have a living hell for Melvin.
Melvin comes across as a
really mean guy, one who ev
eryone gives a wide berth to.
However, Carol, his regular
waitress at a coffee shop,
played by Helen Hunt
(Trancers II, Trancers III) tem
pers his behavior.

Inevitably, Melvin begins
to crack his rough exterior.
Nicholson is at his finest play
ing this tough character who
progressively thaws through¬

out the movie. * You actually
come to like Melvin. _However
the real stars of this movie are
Hunt and Kinnear.
Kinnear is believable as
the tortured artist who
struggles with trying to make
it. He has many tender mo
ments and the producers do a
good job avoiding making him
a stereotypical Hollywood gay
guy- Hunt turns in a really
believable and extremely allur
ing performance. She comes

across as motherly, caring, and
sexy all in one character. Hei
performance is one of the besl
I have see by a female in a lead
in a long time.
From "MadAbout You,"
it 's hard togague Helen Hunt's
acting ability, but she does a
much better job here than in
that silly tornado movie from
a few years back. I've given up
trying to resit the charms of ro
mantic comedies lately. They
just keep winning me over.
Hunt and Kinnear are great, but
Jack ' s the real star of the film.

It's worth seeing just for him.
This is a well acted and
well written story. As a viewer
I came to like all of the charac
ters and I was engaged
throughout the entire movie.
Go see this movie, take some
one with you, it's better than
Titanic ! I give this movie a
four and a half stars out of five.
Well, I'm one of the
eleven people on the planet who
hasn't seen Titanic, but, I'm
sure this is a much better movie.
What would you rather see:
Jack Nicholson in a witty ro
mantic comedy or Leonardo
DiCaprio on some dumb boat?
Four stars (out of five).
And for a bonus to all
you readers, my best picture
pick!!! If the voters have any
sense and don't vote for looks
but rather substance, they'll
vote Good Will Hunting best
picture.

Well, since neither Boogie
Nights nor the Fifth Element
were nominated, I suppose that
As Good as It Gets gets my re
luctant vote.

Sweet Home Alabama

by Eileen O'Donnell
Movie Columnist
What would you do if
you were on a plane with some
of the most notorious criminals
in the country? Most people
would hide in the overhead
compartment and wait it out,
but not Cameron Poe (Nicho
las Cage) in the movie Con Air.
This former Army ranger risks
his life to save the day. Now
how would a decorated war
hero wind up on a place full of
the worst of the worst?
After the Gulf War, Poe
returned home to Alabama. He
catches up with his wife Tricia
(Monica Potter) at a local bar
where she works as a waitress.
In trying to protect his lady's
honor, Poe gets into a brawl
with three of the regulars. He
kills one in self-defense with his
bare hands. On the advice of
his lawyer, Poe pleads guilty to
involuntary manslaughter. Be¬

cause of his ability to use deadly
force, he is sentenced to seven
to ten years in a federal peni
tentiary.
Throughout the prison
sequence, Poe reads and writes

touching letters to
Tricia and their
daughter Casey
(Landry Allbright),
who was born three
months after his in
carceration. While in
prison, Poe becomes
friends with Baby-O
(Mykelti Williamson
o(Heat). The movie
helps the audience's
sympathies to lie with

both Poe
and Baby-O. In a clever ploy
the nature of Baby-O's crime
is never revealed, but it is in
sinuated that he is expected to
be in prison for a long time.
This effectively causes the au
dience to see him as a good
prisoner, like Poe.
After eight years in

prison, Poe receives his parole
and is preparing to go back to
home, Alabama.
Meanwhile, US Marshall
Vince Larkin (John Cusack of
Grosse Point Blank) is readying

a new state-of-the-art prison
transportation plane for its
maiden voyage. This plane has
been designed to transport
criminals all over the country
for medical exams, prison
transfers, and to populate new
prisons. Larkin's main adver
sary on the ground is Duncan
Malloy (Colm Meaney of Star

Trek: The Next Generation), a
pompous DEA agent. He it
involved in this project because
his agency needs to get infor
mation from a notorious mob
ster before the FBI gets to him.
_^^_H Also aboard the
_i _^^^_f plane are Cyrus "The
_^^H Virus" Grisom (John
_i_^^^_H Malkovich), Diamond
^^H Dog (Ving Rhames), a
_^H crackhead named Pin
ball (Dave Chappelle),
_^H and a serial rapist
_^H called Johnny-23
_i _jj_^H (Danny Trejo). The
_^^^P banter between these
hardened criminals is
funny at times, and Grisom's
witty remarks are amusing.
Not long after the plane takes
off, a carefully planned hijack
ing occurs. The mastermind of
this takeover is, who else?,
Grisom. Malkovich is at his
best when he plays the crimi
nally insane, and in this film,
as with In the Line o f Fire, he is

able to accomplish just that.
He and his accomplices have an
ingenious plan to fly the plane
to freedom, but they did not
count on Cameron Poe.
After a stopover in
Carson City, Nevada, the ren
egade plane takes on ten new
prisoners ready for transfer, so
as not to arouse suspicion.
With this new group comes
Garland Greene, a serial killer
in the style of Hannibal
Lechter, played by Hollywood
freak Steve Buscemi (Fargo, The
Wedding Singer).
Con Air is an action
packed wild ride. Cage is a
great hero, Malkovich a bril
liant madman, and Cusack
plays a great straightman to
help Cage save the day. This
film, though extremely violent
and graphic, is funny. The
combination of wit, sarcasm,
action, and romance, coupled
with the excellent casting job,
makes this movie a must-see.

Help for the stressed out

by Christine Sedlacko and
Daniel Sirpenski
Contributing Reporters
Your reflection doesn't
look so perky in the mirror
anymore. The bags under your
eyes are darkening, your
roommate's music is just too
damn loud, your parents call
too often, and Servo seems re
ally bad this week. What is
your problem? This is called
stress. After spring break things
seem to speed up to the point
of unending work. Now we are
thrown into the last half of the
semester. You are not alone,
because most students on this
campus are experiencing the
same anxieties. Don't worry,
there are things you can do...

One thing to do is escape
to the land of beer and parties
and to get really drunk. Face
it, this only makes things
worse. You wake up Sunday
morning—er, afternoon—and
realize that you have two pa
pers to write, three tests to
take, and an eight o'clock the
next morning. So what can you
really do? The following are
some healthy and positive ways
to relax during these rough

mes. Try meditation. We don't
mean Zen Buddhism with
smoke, chanting, and circles.
Meditation is designed to relax
the mind and alleviate worries.
Dr. Herbert Benson at Harvard
University found that medita
tion leads to a relaxation re
sponse which reduces stress.
Here are three methods
of meditation that may be help
ful: 1) Breathing techniques.
Go to a quiet place, shut your
eyes, and focus on your breath
ing. Take two breaths and ex
hale slowly. Repeat.
2) Muscle relaxation.
Tense fists and hold for 15 sec
onds, and then relax slowly.
Stretch muscles before sitting
down to type a paper. Or take
turns with friends giving should

massages.
3) Visualization. Picture
yourself somewhere, maybe the
beach you visited over spring
break, or at home on your
couch (another place you may

have visited over spring break).
Let yourself go.
So, what do you get from
these forms of meditation? It
allows you time away from
worries. Remember, to relax,
you must take a passive attitude
and enjoy what happens
around you without worrying,
analyzing, or judging.
Open communication is
another way to get through
these stressful times and to just
relax. Sit around with some
friends without really doing
anything. Appreciate each
other's company and do not
feel pressured to do anything.

If you have a problem, talk it
through with a friend. Do not
bottle stressful things inside
because it will only make things
worse.
Once you've taken care
of the mental aspects, it's time
to work on the physical. Your
mom said it best: Eat your veg
etables, lay off the sweets, and
get plenty of rest. Food is your
body's fuel. You would not fill
your car up with soda and beer,
would you?
Now that you're eating
well, it's time to exercise. Jog,
play basketball, or lift weights,
anything to relieve tension and

stress. The exercise will keep Stress is taxing on the
you from tossing and turning body. It increases blood pres

Library BULLETin

by Libby Musseltnan
Library Columnist
Q: If I send for something
on Interlibrary Loan, am I
likely to get in it time to write
my paper?
A: It depends on when
you ask and when your paper
is due. Most book loans and
photocopies come in within a
week of request and can be
kept for three to four weeks
(photocopies, of course, are
yours forever). The catch is
that lending libraries are not
required to fill our requests.
So if your request is un
usual (like a thesis or an ob
scure journal), then we might
have to send off to a number
of schools before someone is
able to provide it, or the re
quest might not be filled at all.
Q: I have 100 things I
need on Interlibrary Loan. The
librarian told me that was too
many to ask for. Why?

When placing an interli
brary loan request, ask yourself
how much time you'll have to
read and analyze 100 articles
or books. When is the paper
due? What is a more reason
able number to read in the time
you have? Can you put your
requests in some priority—for
instance, which articles look
the best, which are longest and

might have the most details, do
they come from reputable
sources, etc.? Have you
checked with one of the refer
ence librarians to see what we
may actually own on your
topic? It is easy to fall into the
trap of taking the first 100
items that come up on a search
and ordering them all.
If you start with some
questions, you might find it is
more fruitful to pare down
your list. I mean, GET REAL
Nobody can read 100 items
and process all that informa
tion in a short time. In addi
tion, the average interlibrary
loan costs $30. We don't pass
those charges on to you, but
that's $30 that we don't spend
on something else in the library
Interlibrary loans are really
meant to supplement materials
we have right on hand.

Libbv's Tip of the Week:
Check the new feature on the
library homepage. Under
"What's New" access "New
Books." It will give a listing of
all the new books (and provide
a link to new videos) that have
come to the library in the last
week. Please send more of your
comments, questions, and/or
complaints to

I'll say it out
loud, Vma cynic
and proud

by Christina Dickert
Columnist Spring break is a time to
rest and reflect on the begin
ning of the new semester. My
first half turned out pretty
well, but something that a few
of my professors said to me
stuck out in my memory.
They accused me of being
cynical.
That got me to thinking
about that. Am I really all that
cynical? Do I really question
people's sincerity because I
constantly search for an ulte
rior motive behind their
words and actions?
Nah, it couldn't be true.
After seeing As Good As It
Gets, I knew that I wasn't that
neurotic. What do my pro
fessors know? They met me
in the middle of January and
by February, they are making
these assumptions about me.
I don't think so.

Well, I went straight to
the one person I knew would
be able to answer this ques
tion, the one person who has
known me all of my life— my
mother.
After all, she's my mom.
Moms aren't supposed to
have anything bad to say
about their children. I knew
she would give me the truth,
which is exactly what I
wanted to hear.
Well, maybe I shouldn't
have spoken with my mom.
Maybe she wasn't a good
source. I mean, she's just my
mom. She doesn't know what
I am thinking.
And to make matters
worse, she laid a mom-style
guilt trip on me— I don't
know what happened, but
you turned out to be one of

the most cynical people I know.
I didn't raise you that way. Wow
I love you too, Mom.
So, if she didn't raise me
that way, why am I so cynical?
Who made me this way? I
thought back to my childhood.
Did my twelve years of Catholic
education- socialize me to be
cynical of the world I live in? I
didn't remember any hidden
messages in my theology books
or any subliminal messages in the
hymns at Mass.
Then, I started thinking
that cynicism is biological.
Maybe cynics like me have a
chemical imbalance in our
brains that some yet-to-be-dis
covered medicine can cure and
let us lead optimistic, the-glass
ls-half-full lives. Then again,
maybe not.
Maybe it is the world
around me. With all the racism,
sexism, and basic hate in this
world, it is a wonder that every
one isn't a cynic.

It is difficult to recognize
who is sincere and who is not.
It's not me who is crazy; it's the
rest of the world.
People can get killed for
believing in the wrong God, be
ing a different race, or for sim
ply wearing the wrong color T
shirt down the street. Most of
the world's leaders have the abil
ity to end the world with the
press of a button.
So, is there really some
thing wrong with me or is there
something wrong with the world
that makes me question every
thing? After analyzing my deep
soul-searching, I don't think that
there is anything wrong with be
ing cynical. So, until this world
can (and does) change, I am just
going to have to be satisfied be
ing a cynical realist.

Shopping for president

Political Columnist
Buying a swimsuit is a
chched traumatic experience.
Yanking on at least a dozen suits
in a 3x5 foot cubicle to find one
with the perfect size, cut, pat
tern, color, and label can seem
like the most exasperating of all
experiences. Is there anything
that compares to this frustrat
ing decision-making process?
Selecting the best presidential
candidate for the year 2000 is
going to be similarly over
whelming. Although few poli
ticians have officially declared
themselves in the race, there
are a few names that stand out
like the suits featured on de
partment store mannequins
and wall displays. Let's try few
of them on.

Texas Governor George
W Bush, son of former U.S.
President George H.W. Bush,
was polled as the candidate
most likely to win the Repub
lican nomination at the recent
Southern Republican Leader
ship Conference. Bush has
name recognition, a big state,
and personal connections to
wealthy donors on his side i
His weaknesses are a shoiJ
temper and a sharp tongue. /_J
40 he gave up drinking to try
to mitigate these shortcomings.
In terms of bathing suits, Bush
would be a suit with a quality
name but poor construction, a
DKNY that wears out in the
backside after sitting on the
edge of the pool a few times.

Another man of famous
paternity, Steve Forbes, also
seems eager to grab the Repub
lican nomination. Yet, this flat
tax obsessed millionaire is a
one issue candidate and a com
plete political outsider. Forbes
is like a John Paul Gautier suit
made out of an outlandish fab
ric that isn't functional or prac
tical.

A bathing suit in black
and red plaid flannel fabric
would be the signature of
Lamar Alexander, who often
wore a shirt of that print while
campaigning in 1996. This
former Tennessee Governor
and State Education Secretary
would be a grandmotherly cut
suit with a skirt because he
wants to hide his bulging
tummy—great personal wealth
he amassed through govern
ment connections.
Two rather lightweight
candidates, Jack
Kemp and
Dan ._^^^H_^_Mi
:„? _^^Ht

b e
able

bolster ^^^_M ^^
their im- ^^^^
ages enough to
be considered se
rious contenders. Kemp was
hurt by poor debate perfor
mance against Al Gore in 1996.
Dan Quayle is know for stupid
statements and his inability to
spell potato. Thus, he would be
a suit with a built in bust be
cause what he really needs are
intellectual push-up pads.
The Southern Republican

Leadership Conference en
dorsed Oklahoma Congress
man J.C. Watts as its top Vice
Presidential candidate. Watts,
who was elected in 1994,
preaches regularly and es
pouses family values. A convert
from the Democratic Party in
the early eighties, he is the
only African American
Republican in Con
gress. The Repub
licans would
put Watts . a

on the ticket for the
people who would buy a bikini
just for the sake of buying a bi
kini if you catch my drift.
Across the isle in the
Democratic section of
swimwear there are fewer
choices, however the candi
dates are very modern and
functional. Current Vice Presi
dent Al Gores suit is promi
nently displayed. As a former

C o n -
¥ gressman and
' Senator from Ten
nessee (1976
1992) who focused
on the issues of envi
ronmental conserva
tion and the advance
ment of technology
Gore has shown himself
to be a hard worker. As
a result, the Al Gore
model is a Speedo rac
ing suit in plain
black. Although
some people want a
I flashier, more me
dia savvy presi
dent they

_^^_A should
_^^^ remember that
black is classic
and flattering
on everyone.
House of Representatives
Minority Leader Richard
Gephardt has championed the
issues of healthcare, trade and
tax fairness since his freshman
year in Congress. Know as a
combination of a fiery populist
and a back-room pragmatist,
Gephardt has shifted his views
on abortion and gay rights to

the left in recent years. In light
of this newer, more hip image
a halter top swimsuit with
spandex short bottoms would
fit him well.
Champion of govern
ment-funded health care, en
titlements and Social Security,
Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey
is considering a second presi
dential run. This highly
decorated Vietnam vet
eran and chair of the
_^^ Democratic Senatorial
_^_ftfe Campaign Committee
_^fl 1 has been know to be
_^_Bh dangerouslcandid.
_^^_T The best suit to de
scribe him would be a

thong which exposes more
than you want to see.
Just as new swimsuit
styles are sometimes released
late in the season, more candi
dates may prove to be impor
tant contenders in the presiden
tial race of 2000. Reviewing
the candidates early and learn
ing as much as you can about
them helps make sure you
make the best choice. Nobody
wants to take a swimsuit home
and discover that the front gaps
when you sit down. Thus,
bending over and taking a look
at the candidates from every
angle prevents you from regret
ting your decision at the ballot

This article was my at
tempt to write about politics in
a more lighthearted way in the
hopes that it will be read by a
more diverse and larger audi
ence. Becoming politically in
formed is neither painful or
tedious. Internet resources can
be helpful, as can contempo
rary magazines such as George

ited to C-SPAN and The New
York Times. As college stu
dents, we should all try our best
to know what is happening in
Washington—it affects all
Americans.

Congratulations to all
new members of the 11 fra
ternities and five sororities on
campus! Pledging is finally
over and now we can all get
some rest and focus on the
end of the school year. For
now, the Interfraternity
Council (IFC) is very busy.
This Saturday over four
fraternities will be engaged in
a philanthropy at a homeless
shelter on North Stratton
Street. We will be helping to
renovate a house for a fam
ily. This is the first of four
philanthropic events this se
mester for IFC. We hope to
have great participation and
fun. Sigma Alpha Epsilon
and Gamma Phi Beta coop
erated in holding the second
annual Singled Out event this
past Wednesday which, like

last year, was a great time for
all. Get psyched again be
cause Greek Week is coming
this semester. More details will
follow in other editions of the
"Greek Word" detailing the
events planned.
This year's Greek Week
chairs, Thomas Sansone and
Erika Beernik_, would like to
take the opportunity to inform
everyone as to why Greek
Week will be held in the Spring
this year.
"Many of you are prob
ably wondering why Greek
Week is in the Spring or you
might have no idea what is go
ing on. Well, the answer can
be simplified to one word -
participation. In the past,
Greek Week was a thriving
event, one that people looked
forward to."
"However, last semester
it was difficult to get someone
to come to an event as it is get
ting someone to the dentist.
Greek Week is meant to be a

time to show how proud you
are to be a member of the
Greek Community. It gives
everyone a chance to bond with
their fraternity and sorority.
There is even the element of the
good, healthy competition be
tween organizations. The in
creased numbers in all of the
fraternities ad sororities will
hopefully increase participa
tion." "Since the nice weather
usually increases morale on
campus, we hope that more
people will come outside and
have fun at all of the events that
are planned. Without the in
creased support of every orga
nization, Greek Week will not
be as enjoyable and successful
as it has the ability to be."

One final note to the
campus community: the all
sorority GPA was higher than
any other campus
organization's GPA, as well as
higher than the all campus
GPA. Looks like partying is not
the prime object of our organi
zations.

Consider this

Emailing a bomb threat
to get out of class? Is this the
latest method of procrastina
tion, or has there been a no
table shift in the ethical values
of students?
Though it has not been
proven that the threat came
from a student, it cannot be
ignored that there has been a
marked increase in the amount
and nature of the crimes on
campus.
Just look at the crime
stats for this semester...in ad
dition to the inevitable liquor
law violations, there have been
numerous reports of criminal
activities in the form of van
dalism, break-ins, theft, voy
eurism, and suspicious activity.
Though unpleasant for the vic
tims, these incidents have been
somewhat isolated: most stu
dents were probably informed
only by reading about them in
the newspaper.

Wednesday's bomb scare
threatened the entire campus,
but was anyone truly fright
ened? It seemed that students
cared more that class was can
celed than that one of the most
beautiful, historically rich, and
widely used buildings on cam
pus could have been destroyed,
not to mention the fact that
they themselves and other
buildings could have been

damaged.
Maybe it is a natural hu
man response to try to laugh
in the face of danger (there are
what, 800 psychology majors
on campus--any thoughts?
Anyone? Anyone? Bueller?),
but even though it may have
been a joke, it is quite illustra
tive of the "not me" syndrome
that is becoming more and
more prevalent in society to
day, especially on this campus.
We must be pretty lucky
to live in a place where a bomb
threat is not even remotely
frightening. Some people,
even in this country, face the
real threat of danger every day
of their lives.
It is doubtful that many
individuals on campus paused
during their unexpected hours
of freedom to consider the fact
that the lives of numerous
people could have been endan
gered had there actually been
a bomb.

What does it say about
this campus that people care
more about having an extra
hour of spare time than the loss
of an integral part of Gettys
burg College's heritage?
Wednesday was a sad day
for Gettysburg College. The
reaction of the campus was a
poor reflection on the way we
live flnH think.

Pleased parents
To the editor:

column was by staff writer
Henry Fawell in the previous
week 's issue. Mr. Fawell dis
cussed some fundamental dif
ficulties he had had with what
he regarded as the unfairly nar
row focus of two of his profes
sors on the stated subject mat
ter of their sections of mult-sec
tioned courses. Mr. Fawell
proposed a solution designed
to limit impingement of aca
demic freedom at the same
time that it gives the prospec
tive student advanced warning
of the tact that the instructor
intends to coverthe subject
matter of the course in a non
traditional way.
I happen to share the be
lief of John Dunlap as to one
of the two professors he lauded

As the parent of a student

at the College, I am writing to
let you know how much my
wife and I appreciate your
newspaper both for its factual
reporting of campus events and
for the opinions expressed in
its column and editorials.
We were especially im
pressed with two recent opin
ion columns which addressed
teaching at the College. One
of the columns was by regular
columnist John Dunlap and
appeared in your February 19th
issue. The column contained a
thoughtful tribute to two of
Mr. Dunlap'_s professors who
were denied tenure. The trib
ute was part of a discussion of
student input to important de
cisions on campus. The other
\ 1 i
''' _N
ls

who was denied tenure that the
decision was an unfortunate
one for the College causing it
to lose a great teacher in an
important discipline. (As to the
other professor Mr. Dunlap
mentions, I simply don't know
him.) My point, though, is that
whether one agrees or disagrees
with the positions expressed in
these two columns, it is good
to see a college newspaper car
rying such commentary on is
sues central to the life of the
College.
We will continue to read
your paper with great interest.
Sincerely,
Stephen M. Hudspeth

Nathan Rutstein, "Healing Racism "
What is racism and how does it
impact us as individuals, in our
communities and in our society? In
his speeches and books, acclaimed
human rights author Nathan Rutstein
not only exposes racism's roots, it's
nature and how it affects us all, he
also offers a workable solution to a
grave social challenge that many
people believe can never be resolved.
More than just a prejudice, Rutstein
suggests that racism is a form of
prejudice that has evolved into an
obsessive psychological disorder that
deeply affects perpetrator and target
alike. Hailed as "a brutally honest
portrayal of racism that offers a
solution and does not leave us with

crosse coach Carol Daly has
compiledd a 44-31 record. In
1995 and 1997, she guided her
teams to the Eastern College
Athletic Conference Division
III Mid-Atlantic playoffs; in
1995 the Bullets defeated
Franklin 8c Marshall, 8-6 in the
title game.
Daly graduated from
Gettysburg in 1983 with a de

Education. Prior to returning
to Gettysburg as a coach Daly
was the head field hockey and
women's lacrosse coach at Ply

Bullet veteran Chrissy Nordoff looks to dish off to a teammate.
Nordoff's leadership is a necessity for the young Lady Bullet
squad.

With a few veterans missing from the roster, young Bullets must mature quickly

can career. Last year, Sullivan
third team All-American hon
ors for her defensive
performace. Though stopping
opponents was her specialty,
"Sully" also scored 21 goals
and had five assists to provide
some offensive support.
Chrissy Nordoff, Sharon
Coghan and Heather
Donaldson, and Lisa Beideman
will also be significant con
tributors as they led and let
tered on this Bullets team a year
ago. Nordoff started all 17
games last year for the team,
and finsihed up with 32 goals
and 11 assists on the season.
Her most important effort was
a six-goal output in a 16-8 win
over Muhlenberg a year ago.
Donaldson, who ap
peared in 19 games her first
two years at Gettysburg missed

the 1997 campaign while
studying of-campus. As the
team's goalie, Donaldson had
a .563 save percentage as a
sophomore.
This year a tight Bullets
unit will attempt to uphold all
the preseason expectations for
such a young team. With all
that maturing talent there is no
telling how far this Bullets team
can go.
A tough Florida trip with
lots of hard work was very pro
ductive for a young team that
needs to play together, and gel
as a unit. The age, and experi
ence that the Bullets do have,
will have to show the young
laxsters what it takes to win on

such a competitive level. The!
Lady Bullets next gam coming
up soon and these tough ladies
need you support so come out
and watch a game.

Geared up and ready, the Bullets Lacrosse team prepares for their game'with top-ranked and perennial powerhouse, Roanoke College, before Spring Break.

Henry Fawell
Staff Writer

In the past ten days the
Gettysburg men's lacrosse team
has learned the true definition
of working overtime, as it took
five extra periods of play to
decide the outcome of the
squad's first two contests.
With their record stand
ing at 1-1, the number eight
ranked Bullets have now gained
crucial overtime experience
that could help them down the
road against high profile oppo
nents. On March 7, Gettysburg
played host to number six
ranked Roanoke College, a
team the Bullets beat in the sea
son opener one year ago.
Like Gettysburg, the Ma
roons are consistently ranked
in the top 10 and can provide
fit competition for any team in
the nation. They did just that
on Saturday by dragging the
Bullets into three overtime pe
riods before succumbing to the
Gettysburg offensive attack.

Throughout the contest,
the Bullets relied on their usual
strongpoints-fast-break open
ings, face-off play, and tough
goaltending. Sophomore Mark

while Milliman tallied three,
including the game-winner in
triple overtime which ended
the contest at 10-9.
This past Sunday the
team travelled to Lexington,
VA_, looking to knock off num
ber 11 Washington 8c Lee, their
second straight nationally
ranked opponent.
The Bullets started off
slow in the first period, but
opened the flood gates the sec
ond quarter by scoring five of
the team's seven goals.

Junior attackman Ross
Garretson spearheaded the bar
rage, weaving through the
W&L defense and dumping in
four goals.
Milliman and senior

Scott Lowery tallied a goal a
piece, as did junior middle Rob
Crowe, who also provided
tough defense and solid face
off work.
Freshman Mike Plantholt
delivered a fine defensive effort
by shutting down W&L's top
scorer throughout the second
half. But the second half
proved to be teh Bullets' down
fall, as the offense lost all mo
mentum and was held scoreless
the rest of the game.
"No one could get it in
the net the second half," said
midfielder Lee Hemming.
"Our defense played well and
we just blew it on the offensive
side." Gettysburg's problems,
however, were just beginning.
While they managed to sneak
into overtime at 7-7, critical
mistakes plagued the Bullets on
both sides of the field.

Clearing opportunities
broke down on defense and the
offense failed to regenerate the
first half's momentum. Finally,
in the second overtime period,
W&L struck one final time,
sending Gettysburg home with
an 8-7 loss.
With a number of top-

ranked teams still left on their
schedule, the Bullets can use
the overtime experience to
their advantage.
Last year, Gettysburg
went into overtime on three
separate occasions, including a
double-overtime victory over
number one ranked Salisbury
Sate. However, as junior

attackman Pat Pendergast said,
"We'd much rather win these
games quickly and decisively.
We don't need any more dra
matics."
The Bullets won deci
sively this Tuesday by pound
ing Wooster 23-2 and will look
to improve to 3-1 this Saturday
as they host Amherst.

Young Bullet batsmen showing that they are the real deal

by Ted Hartman
Staff Reporter The Bullets Baseball
team returned to Gettysburg
last Sunday from a very im
pressive week long stint in
Cocoa, Florida. Beating the
Ikes of defending Mid-Atlan
tic Conference champion
Ehzabethtown, the squad tal
lied eight wins, and lost just
three games. The Bullets _inv
proved to 9-3 on Tuesday
with a victory over Catholic
in the team's home opener.
Head Coach John
Campo credits the Bullets'
pitching for the early suc
cesses. The staff as a whole
pitched seven complete
games, appearing particu
larly prepared for this early
in the season.

SophomorePaul
Koether had two excellent
performances in Florida and
proved to be a huge asset in
relief against Catholic, while
fellow sophomore Dan
Sirpinski threw well in his
second outing. For the un
derclassmen, freshmen Pat

Jordan, Tom Boob, Drew Chiasa,
and Jeff Ellis pitched extremely
well in their first collegiate out
ings, was Jordan hurling a one
hitter. With the stretch of non
conference games coming to a
close Campo is beggining is to
narrow his pitching rotation.
Sirpinski, Boob, Jordan, Chiasa,
Ellis, and Koether are potential
starters on Campo's day-to-day
approach with his staff.
Juniors Matt DeVecchi and
Pete R-ttenhouse will primarily
throw in middle relief and should
be joined by two others once the
four-man rotation is finalized.
Gettysburg's closer is
sophomore P.J. McElroy, who
would currently be vying for a
starting position if not for a ham
pering injury. However, Campo
expects McElroy to effectively
seat opposing batsmen in finish
ing Bullet wins, as he also had
an impressive southern trip.

ing coach Lee Rentzell for do
ing an outstanding job with the
staff," said Campo.
Offensively, Gettysburg
hit .325 with considerable sup
port from the bat of John
Woods. The Bullets' first
baseman hit an incredible .513,
smacking two home runs and
plating 13 teammates. His hit
ting prowess guaranteed the
sophomore the title of Centen
nial Conference player of the
week. The play in Cocoa al
lowed Campo to solidify his
lineup, clearing up certain
questions about the order.
The Bullets tablesetters

include Daryl Clancy as lead
off hitter and either Bill
Neston or Greg Kosc in the
two slot. While Clancy should
start all season in left, Kosc and
Neston each represent poten
tial right-fielders. As the sea
son progresses, the two play
ers will either platoon the po
sition or one will emerge as the
everyday choice.
As expected, third
baseman Kevin Grimm,
Woods, and designated hitter
Bill Beining constitute the
heart of the Bullets' order.
Second baseman Bret
Thorpe hits sixth, with either
Jack Tanner or Ken

Rittenhouse batting seventh,
depending on who is catching.
Centerfielder Chris Lunardi
and second baseman Brett
Thorpe complete the lineup,
and provide late order speed.
The scheduled double
header against Juniata was can
celed for Wednesday March 18.
One game will be rescheduled
for the March 27, sandwiched
in between Messiah on Wednes
day, March 25 and a double
header against Ursinus the fol
lowing Saturday. The squad
will play two against Muhlen
burg this Saturday, March 21,
in what will be their first Cen
tennial Conference games.

"I knew our young pitchers
had the potential to throw well.
However, I didn't expect them to
come through so well at this point
of the season; to be this ready. I
give a lot of credit to our pitch-
