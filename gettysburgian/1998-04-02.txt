Fake ID ring busted
Gettysburg listed as one of 35 known distribution locations

from st aff reports
A large counterfeiting ring special
izing in the manufacture and distribu
tion of "near-perfect" New Jersey photo
driver's licenses for sale to college stu
dents at campuses throughout the east
coast has been dismantled, the New Jer
sey State Police announced Tuesday
Gettysburg College was listed in the
police report as one of the locations of
known distribution of the fake licenses.
According to law enforcement
officials, the alleged illegal counterfeit
ing operation was in business to supply
fake New Jersey driver's licenses to col¬

lege students under the legal drinking
age of 21, enabling them to purchase
alcoholic beverages in bars and liquor
stores.
In announcing the arrest and fil
ing of criminal charges against the al
leged counterfeiter and six operatives
allegedly employed to sell and distrib
ute the fake driver's licenses, detectives
assigned to the New Jersey State Alco
holic Beverage Control Enforcement
Unit estimate that the illegal counter
feiting operation netted an estimated
$80,000 per month over a period of at
least two years.

"This enterprise not only realized
enormous illegal profits for the defen
dants, but its very existence strikes at
the core of our efforts to regulate un
derage drinking," New Jersey State At
torney General Peter Verniero said. "I
am concerned by these findings and the
actions of those individuals who know
ingly participated in this fraud. I com
mend the State Police and the other law
enforcement agencies for their diligence
in putting an end to this illegal activ
ity." The Attorney General also noted
that he has discussed the investigative
findings with Transportation Commis
sioner John Haley and that a review of
the New Jersey photo driver's license
program has been initiated. Law offi
cials noted that while certain aspects of

the investigation remain active and on
going, the arrests have effectively put
the illegal counterfeit operation out of
business.
According to Col. Williams, the
defendants were arrested by state po
lice detectives in cooperation with the
Rutgers police department and the
Philadelphia Police Department on
February 14th, 15th and March 1 lth,
1998. The charges include forgery,
criminal conspiracy, possession of forg
ery devices and counterfeiting New
Jersey drivers' licenses.
The investigation began in 1996

Graphic by Mike Williams
when officers from the Rutgers Univer
sity police Department and the detec
tives from the New Jersey State Police
Alcoholic Beverage Control Enforce
ment Unit began uncovering near per
fect counterfeit New Jersey driver's li
cense while conducting routine identifi
cation checks at licensed liquor estab
lishments in and around the Rutgers
University New Brunswick campus.
Based onthose findings, detectives pur
sued investigative leads, developing in
formation to target the source of the
counterfeit driver's licenses.
As the investigation progressed,

detectives learned that "operators"
would visit college campuses to solicit
and recruit students who were under 21
years of age. The "operatives" would
inform students that for $100 they
could obtain a New Jersey driver's li
cense-would reflect an age of 21 or
older. After collecting personal informa
tion from each student, the operative
would take the student's photograph
and download the picture into a laptop
computer. The information and photo
graphs were then taken to a personal
residence in Philadelphia where they
were produced.
Once the licenses were completed,
the "operative" would contact the stu
dent host at the college campus. The
collected $100 fees were exchanged for
the licenses.

Armed with this information,
State Police detectives and the Rutgers
Police Department organized a fake
meeting for February 14. The intent was
to take underage photographs at this
meeting. Amongst the students attend
ing were several female undercover
New Jersey State troopers, who arrested
students at the conclusion of the meet
ing. Following the "operative's" arrest,
police seized $57,119 in cash, as well
as sophisticated computer systems, digi
tal cameras, scanners, printers and other
electronic devices. Shortly after, a Phila
delphia storage room was surrendered
to police, where more computer systems
were found, along with counterfeit
laminates, customer lists, New Jersey
driver's licenses and silk screens. The
total value of the confiscated computer
systems is estimated at over $40,000.
Attorney General Verniero said
that state police and the Division of the
Criminal Justice are working to iden
tify additional cash assets and/or prop

College to host panel on
independent counsel

from staff reports
On April 8, the Political
Science department will spon
sor a program concerning the
current political topic of the
Independent Counsel.
The program will explore
questions on separation of
powers between Congress and
the President, the political na
ture of the Independent Coun
sel and the open-ended nature
of its staff, budget, and man
date. The possition of Indepen
dent Counsel was created
through the Ethics and Govern
ment Act of 1978, which was
created due to the numerous
crimes and complications of the
Watergate scandal.

The department chose a
topic about which students
would be enthusiastic. They
wanted to include something
"high profile."
Many high profile guests
will attend the program.
Alexia Morrison, former

Independent Counsel. She ar
gued in the Morrison v. Olson
case in 1988, during which the
Supreme Court decided that
the Independent Counsel was
constitutional.
Janet Mullins was inves
tigated by Independent Coun
sel for allegedly rifling through
President Clinton's passport
during the 1992 presidential
campaign.
Congressman William
Goodling will focus discussion
on issue of separation of pow
ers. Representative Albert
Mansland of Pennsylvania in
troduced legislation for an in
dependent counsel.
Richard Benedetto is a
political columnist for USA
Today who has been covering
the current independent coun
sel controversy with regard to
Kenneth Starr and Monica
Lewinsky.
The program will be held
in College Union Building
Room 260 from 3:00-5:00
p.m.

Up with music, service, and people

by Cara Masucci
Staff Reporter There are many groups
out there who start fighting
against each other over what is
wrong and what is right. We
see it happen all over the world.
There is one group out there,
though, that would like to fo
cus on unity rather than on
separation. This group is called
Up With People. Focusing their
efforts on bringing people to
gether, cooperation among
people worldwide, community
service, and the development of
leadership skills, Up With
People successfully teaches a
lesson in togetherness to every
one they come across. This
weekend they will bring their
message to Gettysburg.

Up With People was
founded in 1965 and became
independent and a nonprofit
organization in 1968. Since
then they have visited more
than 3600 communities includ
ing countries such as France,
Germany, and Japan, on four
continents, as well as many
places within the United States.
Since its establishment, more
than 17,500 people have
worked in Up With People.
Up With People is made
up of approximately 110-150
students, ages 17-25, who par
ticipate in the year-long excur
sion. According to the Up With

People event coordinator of
North America, Heather Rush,
students convene in Denver,
Colorado, the World Head
quarters of Up With People,
for six weeks and learn about
the production. After that they
are off on a ten month travel¬

ing pro
g r a m
that will
take
them
some
where f a r
across t h e
world.
The neat
part
about
this is
that the
partici
pants do
not

know where they are going
until they arrive in Denver!
While on the road, the
students break off and split
into two groups. While one
group travels to one area, the
other most likely performs in
a country clear across the
globe. Up With People gives
performances demonstrating
their musical and dancing abil
ity on stage as well as off.
One of the major facets
of Up With People is doing

community service. In one
year's time, students on a tour
will do 130 days of community
service each year, for an amount
of 500,000 hours total. They
do service in every country to
which they travel. In the United
States they have painted over

graffiti in Los Angeles, made
presentations at schools, and
will continue their service
theme this weekend when they
clean up Devil's Den in
Gettysburg.
Since it is a non-profit or
ganization, Up With People re
lies heavily on the goodness of
people in the areas to which
they travel. Apart from per
forming and community ser
vice, the students also need a
place to stay. In one year com¬

bining the two casts, more than
28,000 host families will be
used in all areas of the world.
A typical student can expect to
stay at between 70-90 host
family homes. This provides a
knowledge of the culture out
side of what is seen on the tour-

With People
p e r -
former
and member
of thead
v a n c e
team that
sets up
the area
and pub¬

licizes the event before other
performers get there.
Sostheim, from Germany,
was studying medicine when he
decided to take a hiatus and
travel with Up With People.
According to Rush and
Sostheim, this is a typical ex
perience for students on tour
with the cast. It provides a time
of learning and job experience
for students who have not yet
completed their degrees.
There are positions that

are not in the domain of per
formance, but rather in busi
ness management and market
ing, according to both Rush
and Sostheim.
This weekend, the group
will be performing at the
Gettysburg Middle School.
The shows will be at 7 p.m. on
Saturday and 3 p.m. on Sunday.
If anyone is interested in be
coming part of Up With People,
Rush advises they come to
Sunday's performance and set
up an interview.
The interviews are based
entirely on personality, and al
low someone who is hesitant to
decide what is best for them.
Up With People will also have
a table in the CUB on Friday of
this week sponsored by Inter
national Student Affairs.

If anyone is familiar with
Up With People and has seen
the show before, the perfor
mance they have in Gettysburg
this weekend will be an eye
opener. It is an all-new show
entitled "Roads." The show
will tackle the differences be
tween people in every aspect of
life, from age to economic se
curity.
In the end, the people
will come together in the mes
sage of Up With People: in the
end, unity gets a person farther
than hatred or violence. That
is a message heard around the
world.

Puzzling Putnam proves possible

by Melodie Foster
Assistant Features Editor
Despite the public service
announcements on the radio
that portray students chanting
for "al-ge-bra" outside of their
advisor's office, many students
today still run in fear from
courses such as calculus, linear
algebra, and differeniial equa
tions like they would from a
rabid dog or the bubonic
plague.
Mathematical skill has
become increasingly important
in today's technological society,

however, and Gettysburg Col
lege has kept up with the
trends by providing students
with a strong math department
that can hold its own in the
face of outside competition.
Every year, a number of
colleges and universities par
ticipate in a competition
known as the Putnam exam.
The Fifty-Eighth Annual
Putnam Competition took
place on Saturday, December
6, 1997. Gettysburg College
was represented by seniors Ja
son G. Smith and Jim Booth,
and by juniors Jay Henniger,

Andy Danner, Akbar Rizvi, and
Martin Wayne.
This year's competition
was successful for Gettysburg
for two more reasons. Junior
physics/math majors Danner
and Henniger were among the
highest scoring finalists.
Danner scored ten points, and
Henniger scored an amazing 18
points, placing him in the top
20 percent of all participants.
The 2510 participants
were given six hours to solve 12
extremely difficult math prob
lems. The exam was given in
two three-hour segments, one

in the morning and one in the
afternoon. Each problem was
worth ten points, giving a pos
sible point total of 120.
Only 16 students, seven
of whom are from Harvard, the
number one university in the
United States according to this
year's US News and World Re
port evaluation, scored more
than 60 points.
To be ranked in the top
twenty percent, participants
needed a score of thirteen or
higher. The mean score for all
contestants was the usual zero,
according to Assistant Profes¬

sor of Mathematics Bela
Bajnok.
Harvard placed first in
the competition, followed by
Duke, Princeton, MIT, and
Washington University, in that
order. Gettysburg's team
ranked an excellent 130th, the
school's all-time highest rank
ing. The College placed 139th
last year. Only one other small
college from Pennsylvania,
Swarthmore College, the US
News and World Report pick
for the number one liberal arts
college in the United States,
ranked above Gettysburg.

A quilt of psychology, travel, children, and life

by Andrea Quarracino
Contributing Reporter
When a student thinks of
the word "professor", a very
one-sided image often comes to
mind. For some reason many
students have a difficult time
perceiving that their teachers
have lives outside of the class
room. In reality, professors pos
sess a wealth of knowledge just
because they are not one-sided
individuals.
Martha Arterberry is a
fantastic example of a woman

who goes far beyond being a
professor. During the eight
years she has spent teaching at
Gettysburg College, she has
managed to actively pursue a
career in science, and maintains
many of her diverse interests as
well. Arterberry studies the sci
ence of perception in young
children. Her research focuses
on learning about what aspects
of perception are inborn ver
sus what aspects of perception
are learned, something known
to psychologists as the nature/
nurture debate. Through her

work in the Infant and Child
Study Center at Gettysburg
College, Arterberry studies
young children to try to deter
mine the answer to these ques¬

tions. Arterberry makes it very
clear that her studies are in
tended only to address very
specific questions. "I am look
ing at the perceptual abilities of
the child," she said. "I don't
study intelligence. Nothing I
am doing tells me about how
smart a child will be or what
they will become."
One might wonder what
would inspire an individual to
pursue this particular field of
study. As it turns out, as an un
dergraduate Arterberry held
strong interests in both chil
dren and art. Having attended
art classes throughout her
childhood, studies on art per
ception always caught her in
terest. But it was not until her

college years that she discov
ered her love for the baby lab.
Arterberry grew up in
southern California, and at
tended Pomona College in her
home state. Pomona College
has an exchange program that
allows students to study at
other universities, one of which
was Swarthmore College in
Pennsylvania. Arterberry spent
a year at Swarthmore as a vis
iting student, and while there,
volunteered her time in the

baby laboratory. It was there
that she discovered how her
love for art and children could
be combined in studies on how
babies perceive the third di¬

.
In 1983, Arterberry
graduated from Pomona Col
lege with a Bachelor of Arts
degree in psychology, and went
on to see about pursuing her
dreams.
Finally, her diligence paid
off and she received an answer
from a laboratory in Minne
sota. Working in this laboratory
for a year became an extremely
positive experience, so
Arterberry went on to gradu
ate school at the University of
Minnesota and graduated with
a doctorate in Child Psychol
ogy- After graduate school,
Arterberry wanted to find a job
that would allow her to com
bine teaching and research. She
also found the atmosphere of a
small, liberal arts school ap
pealing. In 1989, Arterberry
came to Gettysburg College.

While teaching,
Arterberry likes to keep her stu
dents up to date on the latest
scientific advances in her field.
This benefits both the students
and the teacher at the same
time, as the students are con
stantly immersed in current sci
ence while the teacher can keep
up with research.

Though she has "only
been a scientist for eight years,"
Arterberry told me about a
book that she has co-authored
with a fellow scientist from the
University of California in Los
Angeles. The Cradle of Knowl
edge by Kellman and Arterberry
has been a project in the mak
ing since 1990, and is now due
for publication in 1998.
When Arterberry is not
teaching, conducting experi
ments, or writing, she is pur
suing some of her other inter
ests, one of which is quilting.
Travel is something else
that has caught Arterberry's
attention. She was the 1996
resident director of the
Gettysburg College Interdisci
plinary Study Abroad program
in England, teaching a course
at the University of Essex, and
while in England was able to
work in trips to Scotland and
Spain as well.
It is evident that

Arterberry is a person with
many interests, and has man
aged to lead a successful career
life while staying actively in
volved in the things she loves
to do. Arterberry is certainly the
picture of someone who has
achieved her career goals, in
every aspect of the word.
This is the third in a se
ries of profiles of professors in
science-oriented fields.

The basics on rape defense

by Julia Fallon and Sally Vater
Contributing Reporters
Acquaintance rape ac
counts for 78% of all rapes.
Date rape is the most
underreported type of sexual
assault. According to the U.S.
Department of Justice in 1996,
less than one in every three in
cidents is reported. Women
typically elect not to report
rape because they believe it to
be a personal matter and be
cause they fear retaliation by

their attacker.
There is a strong correla
tion between alcohol consump
tion and date rape, particularly
on college campuses. Seventy
five percent of male students
and fifty-five percent of female
students involved in date rape
are under the influence of
drugs and alcohol. Using drugs
and alcohol can make a woman
more susceptible to date rape
because alcohol impairs judge
ment and decreases motor
skills, which are necessary in

order to assess a dangerous
situation, and have the ability
to escape. A man's judge
ment is also altered as a re- M
suit of using drugs and al- w 1
cohol, so he may misinter- \]
pret signals, and may be- j
come more sexually ag- i\
gressive or even violent. m\
In order to avoid M
date rape, there are some M I
warning signs that may in- f I
dicate a potentially harm- 1 I
ful scenario. Women t J
should be concerned if a M ,
man talks over her, ignores 1
her, or does not show re-
\ t
spect for her personal _K \ *
space. Jp
Experts provide a set W
of suggestions advising 1
women what to do if they ,
are in a date rape situanon. J *
First, it is important to stay \ *
calm, evaluate the situa- *
tion, and consider your

tions. Next, a woman must
decide if it is safe to resist.
Women who fight off their at
tacker have a better chance of

escaping rape. However, the
likelihood of success dimin¬

ishes it the attacker is armed.
Authorities say that if the at
tacker is armed, the victim
should employ passive resis
tance. This entails attempting

to talk him out ot it or distract
ing him, to create an opportu
nity to escape. It is impor
tant to make your feelings
known to the rapist. Ada
mant use of the word, "NO"
makes it clear that you do
not want to have sex. It may
help to use the word "rape."
Hearing this word might
shock the rapist into realiz
ing he is committing a crime,
and may prevent the rape
from occurring.
The best way of fight¬

ing off an unarmed aggres
sor is to get physical. Punch
ing, kicking, and scratching
are ways to fend off an at
tacker. It can also be help
ful to lie to him. For ex
ample, telling him that you
have a sexually transmitted
disease or indicate that you
are expecting someone to
come at any time. Instead of
)ust shouting, "Help 1 " a victim
should shout "Fire!" because
most people will not respond
to a plea for help because they

don't want to meddle in other
people's affairs. Fire concerns
everyone, and people are more
likely to call for help.
If a rape occurs, the vic
tim should go to the hospital
immediately. There, physical
evidence will be taken and the
victim will be treated for inju
ries and possible STDs. Some
typical reactions to the trauma
of rape include mood swings,
detachment, abnormal sleeping
patterns, and changes in appe
tite. For student victims of

rape, these effects result in dif
ficulty concentrating, which
leads to poor academic perfor
mance.
A number of organiza
tions are available to provide
support for women who are
victims of rape. The Rape,
Abuse, and Incest National
Network (RAINN) has a toll
free hotline. Victims and
friends can dial 1-800-656
HOPE (1-800-656-4673) for
assistance in dealing with the
repercussions of rape.

In the early part of this

and for the fact that they never
killed anyone.

I isn't sure if this bank

this movie isn't all that

teased by the trailer which I am
sure everyone has seen. You'd
be just as well off watching just
the trailer.
I'm not exactly sure what

this movie lacked, but it was re
ally in the need of something
to jazz it up a bit. The charac
ters are boring and one-dimen
sional. The story itself is not re
ally that exciting at all.
I was fascinated by the
fact that this is a true story, and
if you do go see it, the scenes
from a documentary on the
brothers which are played dur
ing the credits are amusing and
worth watching.
However, if you really
want to learn about this chap
ter of American history, find
that documentary. I am sure it
is much more engaging.
The movie isn't horrible,
but it's not really that good ei
ther. I'm sure it will be bear
able to watch on video on a
rainy Tuesday evening someday.
That's about all it's worth. I
gwe it two stars (out of five).

I was disappointed in this
film and as a result I have to
give it one and one half stars

Misery meets Field of Dreams

by Eileen O'Donnell
Movie Columnist
With the start of baseball
season upon us, a good film to
get into the mood with is The
Fan. Starring Wesley Snipes (To
Wo>ig Foo, Thanks for Every
thing ] -Julie Newmar, Demoli
tion Man) and Robert DeNiro
(Wag the Dog, Raging Bull), The
Fan delves into the complicated
and delicate relationship be
tween fans and players.
Recently acquired by the

In Case You Missed It

San Francisco Giants, local
hero Bobby Rayburn (Snipes)
is psyched for a pennant. A
.300 hitter for the Braves, Gi
ants fans are expecting big
things of Rayburn.
The season starts off with
controversy. Rayburn's num
ber is already taken by left
fielder Juan Pnmo (Benicio del
Toro). Pnmo won't give the
number up, and is still bitter
that Rayburn has replaced him
at centerfield. During the
home opener, Rayburn and

Pnmo collide in the outheld,
and Rayburn is injured. He
keeps playing anyway and has
a great game. It looks like the
Giants are off to the start ot a
great season, and hopes for the

pennant are high.
After his in
jury, Rayburn hits a
slump. The fickle
fans become angry
that the franchise
spent $40 million
on a player who
can't even hit the
ball. Rayburn be
comes more and
more frustrated and
blames his bad
patch on not having
his mimher. He

tries again to get the number
from Primo, but he won't give
it up, taking back the offer to
sell it to Rayburn.
But one dedicated fan
stays with him all along. Gil
Renard (DeNiro), a knife sales
man, has been a fan of Rayburn
since the days when he played

locally. He is as excited when
Rayburn joins the Giants. Gil
talks constantly about the days
when he was a player, and
shares the opinion of a lot of
people that baseball players

have forgotten about the fans, people think of Bobby
They shouldn't play for them- Rayburn, Gil wants people to

selves because it is the fans who
make baseball great. Gil takes
baseball very seriously. To him,
baseball is better than life be
cause after all, baseball is the
only fair thing out there.
Life hasn't been very fair

to Gil lately. Around the time
Rayburn's slump starts, Gil hits
his own bad patch. He loses
his job and his ex-wife gets a
restraining order to keep him
away from their son. Gil's ob¬

session with the
game drives him
to the brink of
madness. He
wants to be the
one to set
Rayburn's game
right again. Gii
and his hero's
paths cross a few
times, and then
Gil makes him
self an important
part of Rayburn's
life. Whenever

think of him.
DeNiro gives a convinc
ing performance of a man on
the verge of a breakdown.
What makes DeNiro's perfor
mance such a good one is that
you can actually witness Gil's

progression into madness.
Snipes portrays a cocky athlete
almost naturally. This film is
very dark, and at some parts
very surprising, but in the end
it all comes together.
Ellen Barkin (The Big
Easy, Dtner) and John
Leguizamo (To Wong Foo,
Thanks for Everything! -Julie
Newmar, Romeo & Juliet) pro
vide some comic relief with
their constant bickering.
Barkin plays an in-your-face
sports radio talk show host try
ing to get an interview with the
superstar. Leguizamo plays
Manny, Rayburn's manager
and close friend.
Another face that you
might recognize is ex-Philadel
phia Philhe John Kruk as one
of the Giants.

The Fan is a psychologi
cal thriller and the plot is full
of twists and turns. It is a very
suspenseful and enjoyable film.
It's not your typical baseball
movie, but then again, Gil
Renard isn't your typical fan.

CONFLICT & Consensus
Town meetings, air conditioning, stuck-up people, etc.

by Michael Petro
Opinionated Editor
You didn't ask for it, but
dammit, you are all going to get
it again! That's right campers,
due to yet another lack of print
able material I must subject you
to another installment of "Free
Floating Hostility."
My apologies to all of you
optimists out there but, well, it
is the wee hours of the morn
ing and that tends to bring out
the hostility in all of us, espe
cially me.
So what's bothering me
this week? The list is long, yet
undistinguished.
Let's start with April
Fool's Day. What a disappoint
ment! Did anyone hear of any
significant pranks or worth
while capers? I know I didn't.

The only significant effort at
some amusement came from
this publication. That's right
folks, that _Gettysburgian Extra
section is a joke.
And furthermore, why
the heck wasn't the fountain
on? After all, one of the clas
sic pranks on this campus is for
someone to throw detergent in
there and watch all the fun.
Now, I am not advocating any
kind of destructive behavior on
this campus, we all know our
drunken classmates do enough
of that, however, a little good
hearted humor and chicanery
would have lifted everyone's
spirits as we prepare for the
end-of-semester push. So to all
you pranksters out there, you
blew it! Better luck next year!
How about this nice
weather? It was certainly time

to get past the rain and into
some sunshine and blue skies.
I know that 1 enjoyed the warm
weather and hope that it is here
to stay. However, why is it that
the air conditioning hasn't been
turned on in the buildings? I
have heard that there is an of
ficial policy about not turning
it on before a certain date and
that is the reason why you lose
ten pounds in water weight at

Musselman library. Let's be
practical here people! The _^
air conditioning is there j/*
for a purpose, to cool _^r
a building when it is jf
hot! At least turn /

it on in the li
brary! Appar
ently the
bean count
ing penny
pinchers of
this college
have no con
ception of
what heat
can do to
books.
As for
me, well, all I
can say is
that I am sure
glad Ice
House is air
conditioned
indepen
dently in
each unit!

Another thing that really
gets to me is this wholehearted
embracing of the town meet
ing. Today at 11:30 in the CUB
ballroom there will be another
of these town meetings spon
sored in part by the office of
the president. Don't they real
ize that these things won't
work?! Democracy isn't sup
posed to operate in its purest
form. Quite the contrary, the
only way for democracy to
work is to have a small group
making all the real decisions,
which, given this college's track
record, will probably happen
anyway. So in actuality, what
am I complaining about?
While I think that it is
absolutely lovely that the ad
ministration thinks enough of

the campus community to ask
the important question about
a new performing arts building
versus a new science building,
what it amounts to is that the
powers that be will do what
ever they damn well please. So
thanks anyway, but this dog
doesn't chase those bones.
So anyone mad yet? Well

maybe this will get your atten
tion. To all of the stuck up
people on this campus, those
who throw around the "I pay
$30,000 a year to come
here" ex cuse every time some
thing goes wrong, or who
throw trash around expecting
the hard working men and
women of Facilities Services to
clean it up, and who ridicule
Safety and Security for its fire
alarm response time, I say
SHUT THE HELL UP AL
READY!
I am sick of the fact that
college-aged students lament
that they get treated like chil
dren, yet, back it up day in and
day out. Grow up! Have we
declined so much or were we
taught so badly by our parents

that respect is gone? There are
a lot of hard working people
on this campus, people who
help us grow, mature, and suc
ceed, and there is a portion of
the population that treat them
like dirt. Try this for a change,
treat people with respect and
courtesy and see what happens.
You might be surprised at the
outcome.

And finally, let
me talk a little
about silence.
Every day
there are
those of us
who go
k about

Dole worth seeing

by Cammie Grant
Columnist Bob Dole will be on the
Gettysburg College campus
Monday, April 13. A private
lecture will be held in the af
ternoon followed by a private
dinner. He will then address
the public in the CUB ballroom
at 7:30 in the evening.
Dole's appearance on
campus provides an opportu
nity for all students to hear a
prominent public figure speak

about the current politics by
which we are all effected. Dole
is a former United States sena
tor, and he has held a position
as majority leader and was a
presidential candidate in the
last election. He is also a dis
tinguished war hero. Clearly,
his credentials are nothing
short of acceptable. He is a
leader and has done a lot for
our government and our coun
try. Dole is also the 1995 re
cipient of the Eisenhower
I.eadershin Pri7.e.

Personally, I can't imag
ine why every single member
of the college community
wouldn't attend his lecture.
Many do not support Dole and
some disagree strongly with
him. However, he is a high
profile figure, a leader in the
Republican Party, and an out
standing, experienced, and in
telligent speaker.
In 1996, during his presi
dential campaign, he spoke to
a fairly large crowd at the Colo
rado Convention Center. He

is a charismatic speaker and a
true patriot of the United States
of America. He takes enor
mous pride in our country and
has served it in many ways. I
believe that since the college
has brought in an important
political figure that everyone
who is able, should attend.
Gettysburg College is a fairly
conservative school and we
should welcome Dole with
open arms. We should be hon
ored to be able to host such a
nrominent leader.

CONFLICT & Consensus
Talk about the weather

by Christina Dickert
Columnist "Isn't the weather beau
tiful?" That is all I heard from
students walking around cam
pus earlier this week. Yeah, I
guess it was if you actually
LIKE the heat. As for me, I
think I am going to move to
Alaska after I graduate. Take
spring break for example—I
didn't go to some tropical place
like Jamaica, but I went home
to the temperate Lehigh Valley
PA. (I guess money was a bit
of a factor in that decision.) As
for the beautiful weather, I
think it stank unless you could
enjoy it.
I guess you can say I did
enjoy it. I mean, I guess I got a
bit of a tan as I walked past the
quad (where everyone from
Musselman, Patrick, Hanson,
Huber, and Stevens was having
fun) to what seems to be my

favorite place on the campus,
Musselman Library. Remem
ber how we got that email ear
lier on in the week saying that
the library has seen more
people in the past week than
any other week this semester?
Well, sorry to disappoint you
library fans, but it was basically
empty after 9:00 on Monday
night. It might be because the
library was an absolute sauna.
Maybe it's just me, but for
$30,000 a year, I think we de
serve air conditioning in our
library. I mean, doesn't our
college want us to study? That
is the whole point of college,
isn't it? (Well, that could be
debated...) But, no, those of
us who want to dedicate our
selves to our work are punished
with the sweltering heat. Seri
ously, you would be a fool to
go above the second floor be
cause the heat was unbearable.

I also live in one of the
privileged dorms that actually
has air conditioning. Or do
we? When I tried to turn it on,
no air came out. The heater
was turned off too. Where did
the temperature control system
go? Obviously, our loving ad
ministration chose to keep the
bills down with no heat or no
air conditioning.
What will happen if it
does get cold again?
Well, as I've said to my
dormmates as I pass them on
the quad, I will just have to be
content with staying pasty
white until school is over. Let's
look at the benefits— I won't
be at risk to develop cancer, I
won't be smelling like coconut
suntan lotion, and I won't have
to worry about getting hit in
the head with the Frisbee.

But, now, as I once again
head out the door to the library
that sure does sound like fun.

Ode to the students

by Rick Deutsch
Columnist This is the time of year at
Gettysburg College when the
campus undergoes a major
facelift. New trees are im
ported then planted, brown
patches of grass are attended
to, and litter is only a rumor.
With Get Acquainted Day ap
proaching fast, the advertising
strategies are set forth to ensure
things run smoothly for the
twenty four hours the incom
ing freshmen and their parents
spend on campus.
If they fall in love with
the beauty of the campus,
maybe the parents will feel bet
ter about leaving their sons and
daughters on their own for the
first time. Maybe they will be
so impressed, they'll try to con
vince younger brother Johnny
to come here as well. Maybe

they won't think about the
twenty eight thousand they're
shelling out each year. All good
things for Gettysburg College.
But the most underesti
mated aspect that serves as a
surefire way to draw parents
and incoming students alike to
Gettysburg, is us, the students.
I'm not referring to our ami
able comportment or bright
smiles, just our presence. Take,
for example, this past week. At
any point in the day, on any
lawn on campus, there were
numerous students taking part
in a variety of Spring Fever
events. Frisbee tosses, tanning
sessions, (studying?), rolling
around in the grass with dogs.
Essentially, everyone was hav
ing fun.

For the majority of high
school seniors, when they come
to visit the campus and see
what their college is all about,

that is what they want to see.
It serves as reassurance that
they're not going to spend their
entire college experience bur
ied under books in the library
(so no thanks to those of you
who were actually doing work
out there). And conversely,
when the parents of those kids
see that their children are
happy, they too are reassured
about the cost, effort, and stress
involved in searching for the
right school. All good things
for Gettysburg College.
So when those incoming
freshmen are here in April,
don't worry yourselves over
trying to be extra friendly and
smiling at all the parents (that
should be hard). Just get out
there with a towel, some SPF
15, a frisbee, maybe a book or
two to impress, and enjoy your
selves.

Consider this

As this week's edition of
The Gettyburgian will attest,
there are a number of problems
of major proportions currently
plaguing the campus community.
A giant elephant attacked
and devastated a large portion
of the campus, and severely
wounded several administrators
and faculty members. And how
does the College respond to such
horrible actions? By rewarding
these animals with equal status
with human students.
A huge prehistoric mon
ster is skulking around unsuper
vised in the Quarry. The admin
istration and so-called "experts"
continue to turn their backs to
this creature, and use big words
like "extinct" to try to keep the
population from panicking. Are
these people blind? We have
photographic evidence in this
very issue.

A nudist special interest
house will be opening in August.
Is the College prepared for the
backlash that this program will
generate, both from members of
the community and money-giv
ing alumni? To what lengths are
we as institution willing to go in
order to promote and protect
free expression, in all it's forms?
The administration also
seems to believe that it has the

power to purchase property that
is of extreme importance to the
community. Did anyone think
to assess the impact of taking
Wal-Mart away from the Gettys
burg community?
And on the national front,
cows have invaded Montana.
How long can we turn a blind
eye to this problem before it be
comes a reality here in Gettys
burg? The needs of the local
bovine population have gone
neglected for far too long. The
pastures of Gettysburg are a
powderkeg ready to explode.
These issues are of serious
importance and the Gettysburg
College community cannot con
tinue to ignore them. Far too
often, issues and policies that
drastically effect the student
body are implemented under our

noses. We would like to issue a
call to arms to the campus com
munity to confront these prob
lems, and make this a college
that we're proud to call our own.
Resolution of these issues
will not come easily, and not
without some conflict. In the
midst of this battle to retake the
campus for the student body, we
must never forget to lose our
most important asset, our sense
of humor.

Wal-Mart falls victim to College expansion

by Bruce Wayne
Contributing Reporter
Gettysburg College pur
chased the local Wal-Mart last
week in a not so surprising
move. When asked what the
College plans to do with the
superstore, several options
were listed.
College spokesperson
Kevin Young cited upperclass
men student housing or a new
bookstore as "options under
consideration. We plan to
incoporate the Wal-Mart build
ing into the College by the fall
semester."
The housing crisis has
been a significant concern for
the College, and with nearby
hotels and apartment com
plexes becoming scarce, Get
tysburg College decided to look
elsewhere for places to house
students.

If the College does decide on the Future, the Task Force

Wal-Mart will be integrated into the Gettysburg College campus by the fall of 1998

to use Wal-Mart as housing, the
battlefield tour trolleys will also
be purchased and used as a
shuttle service to and from this
newest housing complex.
Part of the Commission

on Enhancing Residental Life,
cited Wal-Mart as a prime lo
cation for student housing. Part
of the building could be used
for rooms while entertainment
facilities could be located in the
other half.

The other possible use for
the superstore is an extensive
college bookstore. This would
drastically change the Wal
Mart look. "All NASCAR mer
chandise will be replaced with
J.Crew, and the small snack bar
will become a Starhnck's

coffehouse," said Young.
Wai Mart's financial
problems prompted the pur
chase. Wal-Mart spokesperson
Jermaine Allensworth gave sev
eral reasons for the store's re
cent decline. "Wal-Mart's main
consumer market is college stu
dents, slack-jaw yokels and
tourists. We just don't have that
kind of market here.
"Also, Wai Mart has been
unable to compete with Col
lege Bookstore prices. If we
offered pencils for $4.50, we
would be broke within a
week."
Gettysburg High School
also prompted the purchase. "It
would be embarrasing if the
College campus were smaller
than the high school," Young
said.

The College and Wal
Mart have developed a good
working relationship during
the recent elephant crisis (see
story, page 14).

Co-ed naked special interest

by Dick Grayson
Contributing Reporter
A new special interest
house, devoted to supporting
the lifestyle, values, and ideals
of nudists will open at Gettys
burg at the start of the 1998 fall
semester.
The "Natural Living"
house was formed after a great
deal of interest was expressed
to the College. According to
program coordinator Arthur
Curry, "students have been ask
ing for this for a long time."
The Natural Living
House, located on North Wash
ington Street, is a twostory
building with eight two-person
apartments.
Men will occupy the first
floor, women the second.

According to Curry, the
house has already had more
than twenty-five applicants to
fill the sixteen available spaces.
"This just goes to show the

huge demand for a program
like this on campus," he said.
Students living in the
house will be required to be
nude at all times, as will all
guests to the residence as well.
Curry stated that while this
might be uncomfortable for
some visitors, "It is part of the
mission of the house to make
our conservative society con
front some of the issues it has
with human nudity."
As part of the special in
terest housing program, the
Natural Living House will be
required to sponsor a number
of all-campus events each year
designed to increase awareness
of their cause. Events currently
planned for next semester in
clude an all-nude dance party
and a raffle.
When asked if the pro
gram has encountered any op
position, Curry said, "there
have been a few members of a
highly vocal minority who have

don't appreciate what we're
trying to do here." He did state
that the administration and
many prominent campus orga
nizations have been "highly
supportive."
"I did get a whole string
of emails calling me a pervert,"
he said. "What people don't
realize is that being a nudist has
nothing to do with sex. It is a
lifestyle that celebrates freedom
and appreciates the beauty and
grace of the human body in all
its many shapes and sizes."
Curry added that many
other colleges and universities
in the country have discussed
the idea of nudist special-inter
est housing, but Gettysburg will
be the first to implement such
a program.

Students who live in the
house will still be required to
be fully clothed when they
leave the residence. This is due
mainly to certain Pennsylvania
statutes that discourage public

Soon scenes such as this will be much more common on
campus due to the new Natural Living House.

nudity.
"The College is light-

years ahead of the rest of the
world in that regard," said
Curry.

Giant elephant terrorizes campus

by B. Abar
Contributing Reporter
Clean-up efforts are get
ting underway today after a gi
gantic elephant leveled several
academic buildings and faculty
yesterday.
Some time early Wednes
day morning, the giant grey el
ephant-more a relative of the
extinct wooly mammoth than
the familiar circus animal we
have all come to love-stormed
across campus, leaving devas
tation and chaos in its wake.
The beast, thought to have
been released from the wild
animal cage at Wal-Mart,
trampled cars and homes along
Route 30 en route to the col
lege. This marks the third time
in as many years that the col
lege has faced a giant animal
disaster. Administrators were
unavailable for comment, due
to the effects of elephant tram
pling.

Upon arriving, the grey
monstrosity began to nibble on
portions of the CUB, as well as
on students fleeing the area.
Apparently dissatisfied with the
taste of the Union building, the
elephant became angry and
reared on its hind feet. Stunned

at this almost ridiculous display
of acrobatics by a 25-ton crea
ture, students and faculty
looked on in awe as the trunk
waved some 30 stones in the
air. Bystanders indicated that

the gigantic
creature, some
10 to 12 times
larger than a
normal el

A trail of devastation: the elephant seen after razing
Penn Hall.

mendous be
hemoth stalked off angry in the
direction of the college. Profes
sional animal handlers, recently
unemployed from Wal-Mart re
port finding a manifesto on the
elephant's laptop computer,
addressed to the college admin¬

istration entitled "An
Elephant's Right to Educa
tion." Scientists speculate that
this elephant incident is in
someway related to the recent
arrival of a dinosaur named

"Ike" on campus. Animal soci
ologists feel that the arrival of
these ancient creatures may be
a result of discontent among
the populations of nonexistent
creatures. The most likely
causes for such dissatisfaction

may be due to such problems
as "extinction anxiety" and
"large-trunk/neck disorder."
Some propose that integrating
elephant and other creatures of
tremendous carriage into regu
lar society would help alleviate

feelings of inferi
ority. A spokes
man from Penn
Hall has advo
cated trying to
increase animal
diversity on cam
pus. Special in
centives and liv
ing conditions
would be pro
vided for these
nonhuman stu
dents to make
their educational
experience at the
College more
complete. "El
ephants, and
other large
beasts," said the
spokesman "will

help better prepare our gradu
ates for real life. We need to
teach our students how to deal
with these creatures, as they
may find themselves in the
employ of an elephant or simi
lar animal sometime down the

road." After some time police
and campus elephant trainers
were able to bring the behe
moth under control. Negotia
tors from the Capital were
brought in to see to the
elephant's demands. The el
ephant and the negotiators sat
down inside of Glatfelter
Lodge to discuss plans for add
ing an elephant population to
the school. College officials
cited the high costs of includ
ing elephants and similar beasts
into a liberal arts environment,
using data from Boston College
and Harvard University that
had experimented with similar
programs five years ago. How
ever, talks were stalled when
the elephant threatened to de
stroy one academic building
per hour until its demands were
met.

Eventually, with repair
and reconstruction costs
mounting, the College suc
cumbed to the demands of the
elephant. Tentative plans, once
all buildings have been restored
to their former state, are to
build a large new "Elephant
and Non-Human" residence
hall, to be located in the Fresh
man quad between Paul and
Rice halls.

College gives nod to homogeneity

by Lauren Hilversace
Contributing Reporter
In an effort to jump on
the bandwagon of the new
trend in American high schools,
Gettysburg College has an
nounced that it will institute a
school uniform policy for the
1998-99 academic year.
Sighting the recent rise in
crime stats and an increase in
overall insubordination on
campus, a Commission on the
Future subcommittee, known
as "The Committee to Seize
and Throttle Free Thought and
Independence" has come up

with the following dress code.
For the men, the dress
code will be as follows. In the
warmer months, that is, August
through October, as well as
April and May, male students
will be required to wear the fol
lowing: Plain front khaki trou
sers, white button down shirt
with oxford collar, navy blue
blazer, Gettysburg College or
ange and blue tie, and appro
priate footwear (pennyloafers
are suggested). In the winter,
the trousers must be gray and
a sweater vest is an optional
accessory. Boots of an appro
priate style and color will also
be acceptable during inclement

weather.
The women are required
to wear knee length or longer
tan skirts without pleats, white
blouse with all buttons done,
orange and blue scarf, navy
blue blazer, and two-inch black
platforms or heels. Stockings
are optional but strongly rec
ommended and must coordi
nate appropriately with the re
quired attire. Furthermore,
jewelry will be limited to no
more than two earrings per ear,
one ring per hand, a single
chain for the neck and one
bracelet or watch per wrist.
Visible piercings anywhere else
are prohibited.

Hats are not permitted
for either the men or the
women, and the display of
Greek letters is limited to ei
ther a cuff or collar monogram
no larger than 1/4" by 1/4" per
letter. Given the College's his
torically high volume of orders
to J. Crew, an agreement has
been reached with the com
pany to provide the uniforms.
The College Apparel Special
Catalogue will be mailed to all
returning student sometime be
fore the end of June. Be sure
to place orders early and re
member to fill out the college
code 434 on each order so the

appropriate Gettysburg Col
lege emblems can be affixed.
Students in need can ap
ply for uniform financial aid by
phoning x6449.
The faculty and adminis
tration will enforce violations
of the dress code. Punishments
will include suspension, expul
sion, and monetary fines for
offenders.
An anonymous adminis
tration official leaves us with
this thought: "Students here at
Gettysburg are always pointing
out the homogeneity of the
campus. To them I say, you
want homogeneity you've got
homogeneity!"

Jurassic pond found on campus

by Eddie Maple
Contributing Reporter
On Saturday, March 27,
two students, who have asked
to remain anonymous, were
walking near the quarry when
a "damn big, prehistoric crea
ture rose from the pond." The
students quickly fled the scene
and reported the incident to
campus officials.
However, before fleeing,
the two eyewitnesses involved
in this sighting were able to
take a photograph of the crea
ture, thus providing a piece of
concrete evidence to support
their claims.
This is reportedly not the
first such episode on campus.
Over the past century numer
ous reports of "strange howl
ing sounds" near the quarry
have been filed, and many eye
witnesses have come forward.
The creature has even curried
a name around campus: Ike the

no way that any large, prehis
toric creature is in the quarry,
either alive or dead!" At this
point, the professor refused any
further questions.

involved a now retired profes
sor. Allegedly, Professor Edith
Scotch was walking her pet
poodle near the pond, and
when she put her back to the
water in order to tie her shoe,
she heard her pet yelp once.
She immediately investigated
and found her poodle, Killer,
dead. She also reported seeing
a "large shape moving under
the water."
Mrs. Scotch commented
on the current sighting, "That
whole pond should be loaded

scientific wor d beheved these

with explosives and blown
up...and I want to be the one
to push the button!"
When questioned about
the plausibility of a prehistoric
animal possibly living in the
quarry, Biology professor Dr. L.
Ness commented, "That is the
most preposterous thing I have
ever heard! There is absolutely

creatures to be extinct. Could
a similar event be unfolding in
Gettysburg?
Even with many recorded
incidents, facts mounting, and
now photographic proof, these
accounts have been consistently
viewed as fictional. The admin
istration was unavailable for
comment on this issue at the
time of press due to elephant
trampling (see story, page 14).

of the reported creature, "It

Sports Spotlight
Draft fans Woods' fire

by Clark Kent
Contributing Writer
Who says Division III is
inferior? You can't tell that to
John Woods.
He came to Gettysburg to
play baseball and has opened
the eyes of many major league
scouts. In fact, the same scouts
who discovered talent like Ken
Griffey, Jr. and Alex Rodriguez
are dubbing Woods, "the best
raw talent in the nation."
Woods has put together
some impressive numbers. Be
sides going 18 for 37 (.486 av
erage) on the team's recent trip
to Florida, he also has four
homeruns in just 17 games. He
leads the Bullets in stolen bases,
and is tops in the Centennial

Conference in every offensive
statistical category.
Hey, who wouldn't want
that kind of stuff on their team?
Heck, if Woods is taken by the
Phillies in the first round of
J une's free-agent draft, he
could make an immediate im
pact on their lineup. The
Phillies could use somebody
who could hit anything...not to
mention four homeruns in only
17 games.
If Woods hits four hom
ers every 17 games, that means
in a 164-game major league
season Woods would be on
pace to hit 39 homeruns. Do
you know how much guys in
the majors make when they hit
39 homers? A lot more money
than any of us will see in our

lifetimes.
Right now, the Phillies,
Angels, Brewers and Athletics
all have the top picks in the up
coming draft. When Woods is
taken in the first round (which
is a definite), he could receive
a hefty paycheck as well as a
huge signing bonus. Many top
notch baseball analysts figure
Woods' first year income to be
around 13-14 million dollars
per season, signing bonus not
included.
All in all Woods is look
ing at making more for eight
months of work, than if all of
us would make if we worked
for the rest of out pitiful lives,
and beyond our deaths.
When asked about his
new found fame a remarkably

decisive Woods replied, "I just
want to play ball. Where ever
1 play is fine. Although, I don't
really like the cold and big cit
ies bother my sinuses, my mom
wants a house near the beach,
and my dad wants a home sta
dium where I can hit lots of
homeruns. Does that narrow
it down?"
It was rumored that the
Mariners were prepared to
trade Ken Griffey Jr. to the
Phillies, in order to get the
number one pick to take
Woods.
"We have a ton of confi
dence in the kid's talent," said
Manners General Manager Bill
Bongo, "We'd even trade one
of the best players in the his
torv ot baseball to get him. We

want Woods bleeding Mariner
blue next season."
Hey, take it for what you
will, but John Woods is the real
deal. He combines the speed
and grace of a fuel-injected rab
bit with the power of a herd of
water buffalo and a smile that
charms anyone to make the
league's most sought after pros
pect since Mickey Mantle.
So you ask, if a tree falls
in the "Woods" and nobody is
there to hear it, does it still
make a noise? Well, this Woods
is making noises all over Get
tysburg and all over America.
So with all his talent, new
found fame, and a truck load
of cash, "J-WOO" as his team
mates call him, will be smiling
all the way the bank.

Cows seize Montana government
Armed cows look to South Dakota, California as next targets

by Harriet Olstein
Contributing Reporter
A herd of over one mil
lion cows overran the state of
Montana on Monday, taking
over the town and state govern
ments. The cows will allegedly
move east through South Da
kota and southwest through
Idaho to California this week.
The residents of Mon
tana, outnumbered by the cows
by over three-to-one, surren
dered to the angry herd early
Monday morning after a group
of five cows took Governor
Marc Racicot hostage. The
cows, each armed with an uzi,
held the governor at his home.
The state legislature held
a special session to decide upon
a course of action. The cows
sent a representative to the ses
sion to give the demands for
Racicot's release.

"We demand that the
government be turned over to
us immediately," interpreted
Lewistown resident John
vCatson, who has been in league
with the cows for over a year.
"We outnumber you and our
needs are not being met."

The legislature held a
vote after an hour speech by the
cows, as told by Watson.
Though close, the legislature
voted to turn over the state to
the cows.
"Our economy rests on
those cows," Republican Rep¬

resentative Bob Russell
stated. "We need to keep
them happy."
"Besides," _^ A
Russell added, /-_"_^ _^

Cow leader Bossie was
seated as the new governor of
Montana. Though the state is
no longer a democracy, the resi
dents of Montana do not seem
very upset about the change.

"Well, Bossie hasn't been
in charge too long," com
mented Great Falls resident
Henry Wallace, "but she seems
to be doing a

Tensions run high in
South Dakota as citizens won

reach their state. The state is

heads the Dakotans
Against Cow Takeovers
group (DACT), currently work
ing to build up an arsenal to de
fend the state against the cows.
The South Dakota legislature is
currently in session to debate
their plan of action.

In addition, DACT is con
sidering sending a representa
tive to negotiate with the cows.
"We're considering giving them
the Corn Palace in Mitchell in
exchange for them not taking
over our state," said Larson.
California residents,
however, know what they are
going to do once the cows
reach their border. "We're
sending all of the troops from
our Air Force bases to defend
our state. We'll be damned if
some cows are going to take us
over," declared legislator
Patrick Hurley.
The Clinton administra
tion is currently meeting with
the representatives of the en
dangered states to figure out
the best course of action. They
have yet to make a statement
regarding the cow threat.
Cow experts give the fol
lowing advice about contact
with the cows:
1) Do not make eye con
tact. 2) Slowly back away un
til you are out of danger.
3) Do not try to tip the
cow. It will kill you instantly
for the attempt.

Former cow plots and amoosing facts

from staff reports
On February 18, 1930,
marked the first flight by a cow
in an airplane. Elm Farm's
Olhe, under the gazes of re
porters, parachuted over St.
Louis, Mo. Milk produced
during the flight was later sold.
A cow jumped off a 10
meter cliff onto a major high
way just as a commuter bus was
passing. The driver braked at
the last moment thus avoiding
the cow. The said bovine

landed on the asphalt, did a
parachutist's roll, got up and
continued running. The
stunned passengers got out of
the bus and watched the cow
canter into the sunset. No one
was hurt. This was apparently
not an isolated incident. The
road passes by unfenced graz
ing land, and cows striving for
freedom have made the leap
several times.

In the Sea of Japan, a

Japanese fishing boat was sunk
by a falling cow. The crew of a
Russian cargo jet stole some
Siberian cows and were flying
home when the cows stam
peded. The crew, to avoid the
plane crashing, opened the
cargo door and the cows ran
out of that plane at an altitude
of 30,000 feet. One of these
sunk the boat. Nobody was
killed. From various publica
tions, as noted m a Dave Barry
column.

MERL SAUNDERS & THE RAINFOREST BAND
The Junction
Sponsored by G.E.C.O., Office of Student Activities/College Union, WZBT, Jazz Appreciation Society
For more than three decades, fans have been getting high on the music of Merl Saunders. His repertoire runs the gamut from funk to
blues to rock to jazz, and most recently new age but his audience is not concerned with musical genres; "It's the vibe that counts," he
says. Merl has shared the stage and studio with the likes of Harry Belefonte, Lionel Hampton, B.B. King, Miles Davis, the Statler
Brothers, Paul Butterfield, and of course, his beloved buddy, Jerry Garcia, whom he still lovingly referstto as "Jerome." Even bands like
Phish and Blues Traveler, with whom he frequently jams or sits in, have fallen under the spell of Merl Saunders. Merl's albums "Save
the Planet So We'll Have Some Place to Boogie", "Blues From the Rainforest", and his latest "Fiesta Amizonica" show his dedication to
the environment.

Bullets shot down by
Hampden-Sydney, 6-5

by Henry Fawell
Assistant News Editor
This past Saturday the
men's lacrosse team dashed all
hopes for a three game winning
streak as they fell to Hampden
Sydney College by the score of
6-5. .
Despite outshooting their
opponent 39-22 in the contest,
the Bullets were unable to rattle
Tigers goalie Scott Ketcham,
who stopped an impressive 22
shots on the afternoon.
"Getting shots off hasn't
been the problem this yearat
all," explained midfielder
Kevin Callahan, "but getting
good shots off has, and Satur
day was a perfect example of
that." The Bullets have outshot
their past two opponents 94
34.

Neither team could build
a solid command all afternoon
as the Scoreboard proved; no
lead ever grew to more than

one goal. The Bullets' five goal
ouput was the lowest total of
the season, even though several
goals were cancelled out by
penalties.
One could say the game
hinged on a freak goal on be
half of Hampden Sydney, as
one of their attackman was able
to bat one of Gettysburg goalie
Andrew Barter's outlet passes
back into the net.
Jamie Bateman led the
Bullets in scoring with two
goals, while Scott Lowery
added two goals and one assist.
Pete Milliman and Callahan
also collected one goal apiece,
and Ross Garretson dished out
two assists.
Hampden Sydney's vic
tory helps the Tigers exact re
venge for several heart-stop
ping losses in recent years.
Three out of the past four
meetings between the two
schools have ended in one goal
victories for the Bullets, includ-

ing last year's 7-6 win in
Farmville, Virginia. Until Sat
urday, the Bullets had won all
six previous meetings between
the two teams.
"I would say they beat us
all over the field," said
midfielder Mark Pollack, "I
think they beat us in
groundballs and defense, they
definitely outhustled us and
they took much better shots.
They should have beat us by
more, but some of their shots
were banging off the pipes."
The loss puts the sixth
ranked Bullets at 3-2 overall.
They will surely drop a few
spots in the rankings, while
eleventh-ranked Hampden
Sydney, who is now 6-1 over
all, will enter the top ten for
the first time this season.

The Bullets will face
Haverford College this
Wednesday before gearing up
for Saturday's game against
fourth ranked Salisbury State.

from The Onmgc and Blue Club
Newsletter It was, a big year tot the
Gettysburg College men's_,
swimming team. Not only did
they complete the regular sea
son with an undefeated record,
but they chopped their titth
Centennial Conference crown
and went on to place twelfth
in the NCAA Division HI cham
pionships out of nearly 50
teams competing. This year's
national event was held in St.
Louis Leading this year's record
performance were the co-cap
tains Pete Casares and Todd
Peters. Casares turned in a time
of 51.02 seconds to place tenth
in the 100-buttertly. He came

Karen Olmstead, Missy West and Kelly Brennan at Nationals

back on the third day to post a
1:54.77 for sixteenth place in
the 200-fIy. By virtue of his
placements, he received All -
American honoiable mention.
He was also clocked in 1:58.17
for the 200-IM, but did not
place in those events.
The two men were |oined
by freshman David Lavigne and
junior Rich Carroll in swim
ming three relays. The four
men placed tenth in the 800
freestyle; 47.27 for the 50-free,
but did not place in those
events.
The emergence of the
men on the national scene place
the team right next to the
women's team.
Sophomore Kelly
Brennan returned to the ranks

of the All-Amencans following
her three days of competition
in the NCAA Division III cham
pionships in St. Lout's, MO.
Brennan captured a
fourth place in her two speci
alities, the 100-butterfly and
the 200-butterfly. She turned
in a 57.82 seconds for the 100
and a 2:08.22 for the 200, both
new school records.
As a result of her perfor
mance, she was named a first
team All-Amencan in both
events. The Bullet sophomore
has been an All-Amencan two
years in a row.

Sophomore Karin
Olmsted and freshman Missy
West also qualified for the
NCAA Championships, but did
not place. Reflecting on her
experiences at Nationals
Olmsted commented, "Al
though I did not swim my per
sonal best times, I learned a lot
and also had a great time. The
three of us grew a lot closer and
had many inside jokes the
whole week. I really missed the
rest of the team being there
with us, it just wasn't the same.
I am definitely ready to step up
and compete next year."

Thanks to young talent
softball is rolling

GCPR Gettysburg College's
softball team posted a 7-1
week, and the tandem of fresh
man pitcher Sara Stokes and
sophomore catcher Karyn
Miller played key roles.
Stokes went the dis ' tance
in the two games she started.
She blanked Juniata 8-0 on a
three-hit shutout and defeated
Swarthmore 4-1 in a Centenial
Conference lid-lifter. The two
decisions were her first of the
season, and she also posted a
0.46 earned run average.
Miller had a big week at
the plate, banging out 13 hits
in 23 at bats for a .565 aver
age. She drove in nine runs in
the strength of four doubles.
Miller is the current team

leader with .568 batting aver
age and a .676 slugging per
centage.
Two other hurlers have
come through for the Bullets
who are 11-4 on the season.
Sophomore Melissa Hazzard
had the second best ERA on the
team at 1.26, while Suzanne
Dailey has jumped to 6.44 de
spite her unblemished record.
Veteran Angle Hoptak,
who ran into trouble early in
the season, has climbed to 2-4
for the year and leads the pitch
ing staff with 10 stikeouts.
The Bullets have pro
duced one of their best hitting
teams in recent years, batting
with a .380 average to date, and
only has three players batting
under .300. Freshman Jen
White is not only the second
leading hitter with a .468 aver-

agej but is also one of the
Gettysburg's most unique de
fensive players.
This starting center
fielder with the speed to cover
a large area of the outfield has
registered 10 assists, most of
them on throws to first base for
a force out. She has handled
the ball 35 times and has been
in on two double plays.
Gettysburg Head Coach
Mike Kirkpatnck seems to have
settled upon a solid defense
which includes White in cen
terfield, senior Traci Bullock in
left field, and senior Mary Beth
Korejko, in right field. Han
dling the infield postions are
junior Erin Kileen at first base,
senior Jill Murphy at second
base, freshman Alyson Adams
at third base and junior Sarah
Graveline at short stop.

Despite skid
freshman Neston
making contribution

by Ronnie Beeman
Contributing Reporter
The Gettysburg Bullet's
baseball team has hit a slide of
late, losing five straight games.
Last Thursday the Bullets
made the journey to Juniata
College. They were down 3-0
after six innings. Bill Beining
gave the Bullets their first hit
of the game. A walk to Brett
Thorp and a single by Drew
Lavenburg allowed Beining to
score and to get the Bullets on
the board. Juniata answered
back with a run in the bottom
of the seventh. The Bullets
were only able to manufacture
one more run in the top of the
ninth and lost 5-2.
On Saturday the Bullets
welcomed Ursinus for two
games. In the first game, the
Bullet's led 3-1 going into the
fifth inning, but the error bug
struck the Bullet's. Three er¬

rors led to three Bear runs in
the inning and handed the Bul
lets a 8-4 defeat. Daryl Clancy
Kevin Grimm, Chris Lunardi_,
and Drew Lavenburg had two
hits in the contest.
The second game did not
change the fortune of the
Bullets. The Bullets were down
10-5 in the bottom of the sev
enth. With one out, John
Woods and Bill Beining hit back
to back home runs to cut the
deficit to 10-7. Three singles
and a walk accounted for the
remaining two runs for the
Bullets. The 10-9 defeat was
almost tied up when Bill
Neston hit a rocked shot to the
right of the second baseman
with a runner on third and two
outs. But the second baseman
made a spectacular play to end
the game.

Tuesday had the Bullets
heading up to Dickinson Col
lege. Once again, the Bullets

were hit with the error bug. n
The Bullets could not over- 1
come a Dickinson six run sec
ond. They rallied in the top of
the ninth with a walk to Bill
Neston, a triple by Jack Tan
ner, and a homerun by John
Woods cut the Bullet deficit to
6 runs. Singles by Bill Beining,
Chris Lunardi, Brett _Fhoip,
and Drew L a v e n b u i g a c -
counted for the final two runs
in a 15- L1 loss.
Bullet outfielder Bill
Neston was named to the Cen
tennial Conference Honor
Role. Neston batted .444 last
week along with the game win-

,
_iing hit against Muhlenberg Bullets with spectacular defens
astweek. He also supplied the in right field.

The members of Alpha Lambda Delta (the national honorary
society that honors excellent during a student's first year in
college) congratulate membres of the Class of 1998 elected to
the Gettysburg College chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. Phi Beta
Kappa, founded in 1776, is the oldest Greek-letter society in
America and exists to promote liberal learning, to recognize
academic excellence, and to support and encourage scholars in
their work. Election to Phi Beta Kappa is perhaps the most
widely recognized academic distinction in American higher
education. The first three students listed below were elected in
September 1997 on the basis of their work through six semesters
at Gettysburg College (on junior standing); this is a very high
honor. The remainder were elected in February 1998. Additional
members of the class of 1998 may be elected to Phi Beta Kappa
at the end of the semester.

Nordhoff, crew roll past Bryn Mawr, 19-7

by Chris Rippey
Staff Reporter The '98 women's la
crosse team began their season
in the warmth of Panama City,
Florida. They spent
their week conditioning
and fine tuning their
skills in preparation for "~
a successful spring sea
son. While in Florida,
the ladies played their
first game of the season
versus the nationally
ranked Ithaca College.

It was an extremely
close game, but Ithaca
edged out a win with a
score of 9-11.
This Tuesday's
home game was a differ
ent story. The Lady Bul
lets crushed Bryn Mawr
to improve their record
to 4-2. Senior co-cap
tain Chrissy Nordhoff
had an outstanding "
seven goals, while her team
mate Susi Mitchell ripped
three into the net to help Get¬

tysburg conquer Bryn Mawr
with a blowout score of 19-7.
The biggest victory for the
women's lacrosse team thus far
occured last Saturday when
Gettysburg battled the nation¬

ally ranked Ursinus. Nordhoff, who has estab- the victory. Playing every sec

Ursinus with a score of 8-7.
Sophomore Jill MacFarUnd un
loaded two goals during her
play, the second of which was
the game winner.

well, dumping three goals to
help drown out Ursinus.
Freshman goalkeeper Michele
Centrella was on fire that Sat
urday, she had an impressive
10 saves to contain Ursinus for

saves. Senior co-captain Kristin
Sullivan has been an essential
element in the Lady Bullets'
winning season to date. "Sully
is an integral part of our de
fense. She continues to
cause turnovers and
force interceptions in
~™~~~ every game she plays,"
commented assitant
coach Kristen Stuckel.
A large part of the Lady
Bullets' success can be
attributed to her incred
ible defensive skills. A
returning third team
Ail-American, Sullivan
has an omnipotent pres
ence in the midfield and
fine tuned skills which
will continue to aid the
team throughout the
season.
The team will be
on the road Saturday
for their anticipated
¦*" _" game versus Salisbury.
Salisbury has a strong squad this
season, but Gettysburg plans to
be victorious and hopes to take
their overall record to 5-2.
