APRAB seeks suggestions

By Cara Ma.succi
STArF Writer
Do you feel like your voice isn't
being heard in regard to campus
policy? Are you out of touch with the
College's policies on alcohol use?
While many may have the mentality
that their voice isn't heard in regard to
policy making, this is not necessarily
the case. One of the main examples of
student involvement and input in cam
pus issues is the Alcohol Policy Review
and Advisory Board

(APRAB).
In response to the
Statement on Residential
and Social Life that the
Board of Trustees released
this past fall, APRAB un
dertook the task of look
ing at and reviewing the
College's Alcohol Policy.
APRAB especially empha
sizes input from the differ
ent spectrums of the cam
pus community.
Professor Robert
Bornstein stated that this
communication amongst
students, faculty, adminis
tration and staff is funda
mental in looking at issues

concerning drinking and
the policies that go along
with it. "The committee is
less polarized than one

An open forum will take place next Thursday in the Ballroom of the
CUB to review College alcohol policies and work toward their
improvement

would think - faculty, administration
and students are looking hard for ways
to give students more choices and free
dom to make responsible decisions
concerning alcohol use."
Bornstein went on to say that
while many times it is quite possible to
see administrators and faculty as look
ing for a way to "bust" students for
drinking, there is a deeper issue at
hand. "The fundamental values that we
want to put into play are to encourage
students to be responsible in regard to
alcohol use, and to encourage respect
able, responsible behavior. If we can
do these things I feel we have done our
job," Bornstein explained.
This concept was reiterated by
Tom Mottola, Dean of Judicial Affairs.
"What we have done is _identifv valnpc

that are a key focus and looked at ways
of exploring them. Legal use of alcohol
can be part, but not all of the experi
ence".
Fiom the viewpoint of APRAB,
community values have been recom
mended as the primary focus of work
on campus. The committee has outlined
four key factors: personal responsibil
ity, disruptive behavior, community im
pact of irresponsible alcohol use, and the
appropriate role of legal alcohol use in
campus social life.
Many ideas have stemmed from

this outline on how to implement these
components. APRAB is currently review
ing social event policy, specifically the
effectiveness of the BYOB policy. APRAB
is also looking at the designation of new
social spaces where alcohol may be part
of an event, but not the sole focus.
In the educational aspect of alco
hol policies, the school is also looking
further into better judicial sanctioning
and more training for residence life staff,
Safety and Security, Greek students, and
other key campus groups.
Bornstein commented that the
committee would like to see students
take an active role in incorporating the
later two items on the outline into their
daily lives. Students could than use the
responsible behaviors they learned to
help monitor various social situations
with other students.

Organizations like party patrol
can act as the go between and serve as a
view of students actively involved in
promoting the campus values.
While APRAB has collectively
gathered ideas on campus policy for the
students as a whole, one of the things
that they would like to look at is the
individual student. Bornstein remarked
that many schools are not successful
with campus alcohol education because
they look at _ithe student body as one
collective unit with the same alcohol is
sues. Yet, this is often not the case.
"Prnhlems are different

for different students,"
Bornstein said.
Realizing this is the
case, APRAB would like
to glean as many differ
ent perspectives on the
'suggestions that they
have come up with as
possible. Next Thurs
day, APRAB will host an
off-Common Hour in
the CUB Ballroom de
voted entirely to a dis
cussion of alcohol policy.
The goal is to give
every member of the
campus community a
chance to directly affect
the direction of alcohol
policy and campus cli
mate. The discussion will
operate like as an open
forum. Students will lead

discussion in small groups, according to
Mottola. The group will then reconvene
for a larger discussion. All members of
the campus community are welcome -
students, faculty, administration, and
staff will all play an important role in
the discussion.
Both Mottola and Bornstein com
mented that the discussion is called an
open forum for a good reason. There
will be no unacceptable suggestions.
Everyone's views are welcome.
Mottola made the point that "the
more we talk about alcohol policies, the
more we learn. The more we learn, the
better decisions we can make."
The "CUB CRAWL" will take
place next Thursday, March 2, in the
CUB Ballroom. Free pizza and soda will
be offered, along with a free environ
ment for discussion.

West commemorates
black history month

By Laura Rooi
Stah- Wrui-r
Black History Month at
Gettysburg College was both
unsettling and unnerving.
That's the atmosphere that Di.
Cornell West tried to create in
the speech he gave on Febru
ary 9 in Christ Chapel.
"Tradition is not some
thing that you inherit," Dr.
West began, "Having a deep
sense of history is Un-Ameri
can." Amencans do not believe
that then histoiy has been

lengthy enough to create in
tense feelings toward if. Bur it
is not the length ot time, it is
the way that Amencans legard
it. West pointed out that we
have a hard time being honest
with ourselves. We cannot face
the problems ot our Western
society. We are not as affected
by violence as we should be.
This left West question
ing, "What does it mean to be
human if we cannot look in the
face ot suffering without being
so jaded?"
It is hard to convince
Americans that issues of injus
tice aie urgent ones— it is haid
to _centialize such a society.
¦_

u we
need to take re
sponsibility foi
injustice," West;
punctuated his I
point, "And we I
need to stop ig
noring the under- 1
side of American 1
life. Intelligence is!
confronting the I
good and the
bad." I
_i nis issue

lies at the center of the three nance ot maiket culture, and
fundamental challenges that the centrahty ot public life in
face Amencans today. The es- democracy Amei leans need to
calating level ot dispanty be- be honest with themselves and

The Campus Blotter

By William Lee
Western Illinois University
PROVIDENCE, R.I.
(TMS) — Police at Brown
University are stepping up
campus patrols after a student
was robbed at gunpoint.
According to the Brown
Daily Herald, the Feb. 15 in
cident started when the victim
was walking on campus and
noticed five men following
him. The student said one of
the men brandished a "large,
black gun" and demanded
money from him. The victim
said he complied and that an
other man hit him in the head
with a heavy object.
The victim suffered sev
eral cuts on his face, but was
in good condition. The police
have a description of the gun
man and have put out a bulle
tin.

SAN JOSE, Calif. (TMS)
— Officials at Cabrillo Col
lege have reinstated a former
campus sergeant who was
fired for his part in what many
believed was a racially moti
vated arrest of four black foot¬

ball players.
The college's board of
trustees agreed Feb. 14 to re
hire George Turegano, 57,
and pay him lost salary.
Turegano was fired in April
1997 for an October 1996
incident when, according to
an investigator, he unfairly
arrested four black football
players for allegedly using a
university credit card without
permission.
According to the San
Jose Mercury News, Turegano
chose not to arrest two white
players also linked to the in
cident.
Despite their decision to
rehire Turegano, Cabnllo's
trustees made it clear that they
did not approve of the
officer's past performance.

"The board of trustees
sharply criticized Mr.
Turegano's performance, but
determined that there was in
sufficient evidence of dispar
ate treatment based on race by
Mr. Turegano to justify termi
nation," school officials said
in a prepared statement. Last
year, an arbitrator said

Turegano had enough evi
dence to justify the arrests of
the four players and reason
able doubts about the white
players' guilt, according to the
San Jose Mercury News. It
isn't known whether
Turegano will accept the
college's job offer, and the
back pay to be paid to him has
not yet been calculated.
Turegano also has a lawsuit
against Cabrillo pending in
federal court.
PROVO, Utah (TMS) —

A student working for
the university has reported
seeing suspicious activity near
the site of the stolen papers,
reported missing last week.

20% of aid applicants leave drug
question blank

By TMS Campus
WASHINGTON (TMS)
— If you skipped that ques
tion about drug convictions
when you applied for federal
financial aid, don't think the
U.S. Education Department
failed to notice.
Department officials an
nounced Tuesday that they are
taking steps to deal with you
and more than 100,000 other
students, or about 20 percent
of applicants, who also
dodged the question. The
2000-01 academic year is the
first in which students con
victed of drug offenses are in
eligible for federal aid.
Department officials
said they would let colleges
distribute aid to students who
didn't answer the question on
their applications. But officials

also said the depai tment
would send notices warning
those students to mloim the
department of any convictions
— and potentially lose then
aid — or run the risk of
greater penalties associated
with lying on the form.
The department's deci
sion has relieved many col
lege-aid administrators who
feared students who left the
question blank would auto
matically be presumed guilty.
Many said they thought appli
cants left the answer blank un
intentionally.
Department officials
said they decided to cut stu
dents slack after calling about
1,500 applicants who didn't
respond to the question.

"Almost all of them said
that they did not answer be
cause they were confused by

the question oi snnplv forgot
to answei it," Cm eg Woods,
duet opeiating olfleer of the
depai tment'_s OMili; of Stu
dent Financial Assistance, told
The Chronicle of Higher Edu
cation.
Students who failed to
answer the question have had
their financial aid held up as
the department has decided
what to do with them.
Under the law, approved
in 1998, students with one
conviction of drug possession
risk losing their aid eligibility
for one year; two years for a
second conviction; and indefi
nitely for a third conviction.
Students caught selling drugs
lose eligibility for two years af
ter a first conviction and in
definitely after a second. Eli
gibility for aid could be re
stored in less time if the stu¬

dents satisfactorily complete d
di ug-rehabihtation progi am.
or if their convictions are re
versed or set aside.
Wood said just under 1
per cent of the 590,000 stu
dents who have applied for
aid for the coming academic
year have acknowledged being
convicted of drug-related of
fenses, the same, he said, as
the national aveiage for the
U.S. population.

National politics come home to
Gettysburg

by Barb Dickson
Editor-in-Chief
Another election year has
rolled around, and the news is full
of political candidates, issues, and
negative campaigning. Students
may feel distant from national
events, but there's one student who
has thrown himself into the politi
cal arena. Senior Brent LaRosa was
named Co-Chair of Republican
John McCain's Campaign in
Adams County.

LaRosa first experienced
McCain fever over Christmas
break, when he attended the Re
publican debate in Durham, New
Hampshire. "I was in the crowd,
hooting and hollering, shouting
"John McCain!'" says LaRosa.
McCain entered the crowd to
shake hands with his supporters
who were holding McCain signs.
After the rally, the supporters who
were over age 21 headed to a local
pub to watch the debate.

"After the debate was over, the
Straight Talk Express [McCain's
campaign bus] pulled up to the pub
and [John McCain] shook hands
with all the supporters in the pub, "
relates LaRosa. "There must have
been 250 of us, but he took the
time to shake all our hands. He's
very personable—I like that."
After this very positive expe
rience, LaRosa decided he wanted
to get personally involved in the
McCain campaign. When he got
back to Gettysburg, he went onto
McCain's website
(www.McCain2000.com), emailed
the Central Pennsylvania McCain
Campaign Chair, Tom Pelikan, and
offered his support to the cam
paign in Adams County, particu
larly at the College. "About a week
later I got a phone call and
[PelikanJ offered to make me one
of the co-chairs of Adams County,"

recalls LaRosa. "Of course I said
yes." LaRosa holds a very positive
view about McCain's appeal. "He
has a strong following among

young people
who have
become disillu
sioned about politics,
especially
the Re
publican
Party.
He's able
to garner
a lot of
cross
party support;
for ex
ample,

his recent
victory in
M 1 c h i -
gan. I
think a
lot of
young people

off by the

Co-Chair by displaying a John McCain

shifty politics of George
W. Bush and reject the political ma
chine of any party."
He adds, "I think a lot of
people are attracted to his war hero
status, [and] his maverick image.
America loves the underdog."
When questioned about rea
sons for his own support of
McCain, LaRosa answers, "I've al
ways considered myself to be a
pretty strong Republican, but mod
erate. I'm drawn to his stance on
issues like campaign finance re
form, abortion [McCain is pro
life], his strong position on the
military, [and] his proposal to cut

taxes while preserving important
programs."
LaRosa also admires
McCain's pledge to wage a clean
campaign. Though some negative

Bush in Michigan, winning 50% of
the vote to Bush's 43%. McCain's
victory in his home state of Arizona
came as no surprise. He beat Bush
60% to 34%.
The Michigan victory was a
significant one for McCain, com
ing soon after his loss in South
Carolina on Saturday. A loss in
Michigan could have significantly
slowed down his campaign. The
defeat in _Sopth Carolina slowed
McCain's momentum, but
Tuesday's victories have forced
people to look at McCain in a new
light. Whereas before, McCain's
possibilities for gaining the Repub
lican nomination looked doubtful,
he seems to have become more of
a contender.

But whether or not you sup
port McCain, it is a good idea to
make your voice heard in national
politics.
"I urge every student to reg
ister to vote and any student that
would like to get involved in the
McCain campaign leading up to
the Pennsylvania primary in early
April should contact me," says
LaRosa.
LaRosa can be contacted at
s382490. If interested, a meeting
is being held tonight at 7 p.m. in
College Apartments 1.
McCain's appeal may have
more to do with the future of the
presidency than where he stands on
the issues. As LaRosa comments,
"Out of all the candidates, both Re
publican and Democrat, he's the
only one I can look up to."

ads were
shown,
McCain quickly
pulled them from
the air.
"Bush has
not pulled
his ads,
which I
don't
like," says
LaRosa.
LaRosa
is now
working with fel
low co
chairs Dick
Burst and
David
Liebler on

getting
Adams County riled up
aboutJohn McCain.
So far

LaRosa has been impressed with
the reaction he's gotten. "I've got
ten a lot of support from the cam
pus community," he says. "I was
surprised by how many McCain
supporters there are on campus, es
pecially those willing to be active
in the campaign."
The future of the McCain
campaign seems positive.
LaRosa states, "Spurred by
[McCain's] recent victories in
Michigan and Arizona, we are
looking forward to an active and
competitive campaign, Super
Tuesday and beyond. "
On Tuesday, McCain upset

GRAB the experience

by Kristin A. _Toburen
Stai-f Writer
We have all heard
complaints about there be
ing nothing to do for fun
in Gettysburg. Most of us
have been known to utter
a few of those grumbles
once in a while. The bar
scene, the parties, die same
routine become very old
very fast on any campus.
What many students
do not realize is that
Gettysburg College pro
vides a ready resource for
off-campus enjoyment and
if they do know about it,
many do not take advan
tage of it.

GRAB, the
Gettysburg Recreational
Adventure Board, is per
haps one of the most un
derestimated and misun
derstood services offered
on our campus. GRAB
trips vary widely in their
nature, and anyone can
participate; no experience
is necessary to take part in
any of the activities.
Program coordinator
Paul Hutchinson, a 1998

graduate of Gettysburg
College, discussed how
the program has enjoyed
an explosion of participa
tion since its outset in the
summer of 1996. At the
time, only two trips per
semester were offered
and the excursions were
limited to rock climbing
and backpacking. Last
year alone there were 42
trips that included activi
ties such as kayaking, ver
tical and horizontal cav-

of John Regentin and ten
student facilitators; now
there are 26 facilitators,
two professional staff
members, and an intern
filling two offices in the
basement of Plank and
one in the CUB.
Hutchinson at
tributes this growth in
part to the ASCENT pro
gram, which offers every
first year student the op
portunity to go on a trip
with a group of people
before his or her college
career even begins.
Hutchinson says that the
main focus of the AS¬

CENT program is to ease
students into the college
experience and provide
them with an atmosphere
conducive to forming close
ties with others. Only ten
people are taken on each
trip and the small numbers
help students to trust one
another. Many partici
pants remain in contact
with their ASCENT group
throughout their four
years.
That is the mission at

the heart of the GRAB pro
gram. "GRAB is an oppor
tunity for students to try
things that they never
thought they could do,"
Hutchinson says. He feels
that their program is com
parable to the Center for
Public Service because
there are so many oppor
tunities in each program
for personal growth.
GRAB seeks to help
students overcome their
fears and break down the
barriers that they have
built within themselves.
The risks on each trip are
minimal. Hutchinson feels
that fears are mostly inside
the participants, because
they have talked them¬

selves into believing that
they could never climb the
wall or hike the trail. In
reality, anyone can do
nearly any program that
GRAB offers.
Many common mis
conceptions among stu
dents prevent them from
taking part in what could
possibly be a life-changing
experience. First, most stu
dents feel that the trips
must be too expensive. In
truth, the rates are ex¬

tremely low. For a three
day backpacking trip that
includes all equipment,
transportation, permits, fa
cilitators, and food, the
cost is $25.00. Climbing
and Caving trips run for as
little as $10.
The most expensive
trip is a white water raft
ing excursion in West Vir
ginia over Easter Break that
costs about $160 because
the office must contract a
guide for the trip.
The next excuse stu
dents give is that they just
do not have the time to
pack up and leave campus
for a few days or even over
night. Hutchinson says
that the staff appreciates

the full schedules of stu
dents and therefore caters
to their needs. They offer
short trips during the week
that will take only five or
six hours and have partici
pants back by ten p.m.
which is usually before
most of us begin our
homework anyway. Many
athletes have practices or
games every weekday and
Saturdays, so they now of
fer trips on Sundays in or
der to serve a more diverse
group of people.
Finally, many stu
dents shy away from
GRAB programs because
of the term "adventure".

Most people associate ad
venture with danger and
are afraid that they will not
be able to handle whatever
will be expected of them.
Candidly, Hutchinson in
sists that the most danger
ous part of every trip is the
drive to and from the site.
Only vertical caving
requires experience; all
the other trips are de
signed exclusively for fun
and relaxation, a chance
for students to do some
thing new and hopefully
learn something about
themselves in the process.
GRAB offers more than
just an adventure; it pro
vides a physically, mentally
and socially healthy break
from campus.

Most importantly, it
proves to students that
there is more inside them
selves than they realize.
Hutchinson smiles as he
says, "I don't think there
is anything more invigo
rating than to come out of
a cave and think, 'Man, I
just did that.'"

Be a "Millionaire" online

by Richard Hun
Knight-Ridder Tribune
ABC's ratings juggernaut
"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"
will roll out an Internet compo
nent next month to let viewers
at home play along with Regis
Philbin as the show unfolds on
the air. The online game will
premiere in March.
"Our application is going
to be very much like the game,"
said Jonathan Leess, vice presi
dent, general manager and ex
ecutive producer for ABC's En
hanced TV. "It's designed to al
low the viewer to play along with
the contestant in real time."
Online players will com
pete against each other for yet
unspecified prizes. The final for
mat of the Internet game will be
decided in the coming weeks as
ABC tests the system with
Internet users. "Who Wants

to Be a Millionaire" produc
ers will turn over tapes of the
pre-recorded telecasts to En
hanced TV staffers, who then
will create a specially pro
duced Internet game. The key
for viewers at home will be to
answer the questions as
quickly as possible.
The Internet game will
go to commercials of sorts at
the same time as the TV game.
At ihese breaks, the Internet
players will get questions that
refer to what's going on in the
TV game.
For instance, Internet
players would be asked what
color tie host Regis Philbin is
wearing. To succeed, players

would have to keep an eye on the
television at all times.
"It's going to be a virtual live
experience," Leess said.
According to Leess, the online
component of "Millionaire" was in
the works long before the show be
came a smash hit.
Since the launch, ABC.com
has had a separate Internet version
of the game available. However,
that game is not connected to the
show itself. There also is a CD
ROM version available to play on
personal computers.

Dear Libby,
Get the Pittsburgh Post
Gazette. Three Rivers Rodney
Dear Triple Rivers,
Libby loves Pittsburgh
too, and even tries to emu
late a genuine Pittsburger from
time to time by saying things
like gum band instead of rub
ber band, pop instead of soda,
crick instead of creek and still
mill instead of steel mills, even
though there aren't any of ei
ther left in Pittsburgh any¬

more. But sadly, we can't get
every hometown paper, and
you should see the requests we
get from the New Jersey trans
plants. Then there are the per
sonal favorites of your pals
from Connecticut, Maryland,
Ohio, California and on and
on. So Libby is sticking with
the major national papers, a
sampling of international
newspapers and the two local
ones (Gettysburg Times and
Harrisburg Patriot).
But you're in luck if you
want a daily dose of dahntahn
Pittsburgh. Check out this
link: http://www.post
gazette.com. Libby is discov
ering that most local papers
have a website. So click on
this and enjoy the steel city

news.
Dear Libby,
Please buy Bow Wow
Highway. (Unsigned)
Dear Bow Wow,
Do you mean Powwow
Highway} The film based on
the novel by David Seals about
Philbert, a Montana Cheyenne
who gets involved in the po
litical vendetta of Buddy Red
Bow, who is trying to free his
unjustly accused sister? Libby
will stop here so she doesn't
spoil the plot. If this is what
you want, it is on reserve.
Dear Libby,
Rent out the green com¬

puter cords so that laptops
can be connected to the
internet in the library easily.
Unsigned
Dear Laptopper,
Good idea. No rent
though. Libby talked to IR
and they are making some
cords. We'll make them avail
able for check out at circula
tion free of charge. Thanks
for the suggestion.
Dear Libby -
I found an article listed
in Eighteenth Century Life.
When I checked MUSCAT to
see if we have it, it says

INTERNET RESOURCE,
Location: Networked Re
sources! What does this
mean? I'm not allowed to use
the Internet for my research,
only scholarly journals, what
ever that means. Is this a real
journal? How do I actually
find it? KF (submitted by
email)
Dear KF,
This particular Internet
resource is legitimate. Use it.
Click on the link and you'll
go right to the journal online.
How do you know if it
is a good source ? Well, Libby
cataloged it in Muscat for one
thing—and Libby does not
catalog junk. Some websites

are garbage. Pure stupidity.
Somebody's idea of how to
waste your time. With the
web, you don't know who the
author is— a scholar or some
sixth grader who knows html.
But if we have it cata
loged in Muscat it will say
"Internet Resource" and it is
fine to use it for youi; paper.
Even though Eighteenth Cen
tury Life comes to you via the
Internet it's a real journal.
Ditto with Astrophysical Jour
nal, Journal of Finance, Jour
nal of Philology and loads of
others. More than 500 actu
ally. Look on the Muscat
screen—at the button under
Videos and DVDS. There's a
link for online journals, all ar¬

ranged by topic. Cool.
Or just search the title in
Muscat, just like you would for
any other journal.
Just so you know, this
stuff isn't free. It's part of a
group of journals the library
buys to make you keyboard
hungry, online addicted future
scholars of America become
happy and efficient researchers.
One click and there's the ar
ticle, full text, on your desktop,

at two in the morning or
whenever-the library without
walls. Happy? You bet.
And one more thing, if
you don't know what a schol
arly journal is, I suggest you ask
for some guidance at the refer
ence desk. Or if you're the shy
type, check out the link for
"Scholarly vs. Popular Jour
nals" under How Do I Find, on
the Library Webpage. You'll get
a clear, totally painless descrip
tion there.

Looking for a few good
behinds: Put your posterior
into action. Beginning next
Tuesday Libby will be trying
out some replacement lounge
furniture and desk chairs, with
the plan to upgrade the seating
in the library. Bring your be
hind to the new books area,
across from the circulation desk
and vote with your seat. Com
ments on comfort, durability
and snooze-ability welcome.
Hearts to the library's
people behind the glass walls in
interlibrary loan and technical
services who order books, pre
pare new books, journals, vid
eos and other materials and
who maintain the library's
computer systems such as
MUSCAT. You don't often see
them, like Libby does, but the
work they do is vital to the ser
vices and materials you depend

on. Do you have a question,
suggestion or complaint? Send
it to Libby_'s email at lmussel
or drop a note in the sugges
tion box on the front desk.

weaves the two to¬

fortunately, at times the book
takes on the tone of a lecture
and the pages turn a little more
slowly than they should.
Even so, you can feel
Winchester's devotion to the
OED, a passion that began
when he stumbled upon some
of the dictionary's original

writing and his obviously me
ticulous research.
The story not only over
flows with interesting facts
about the dictionary (in the
original twelve volumes there
are 227,779,589 letters and
numbers!), but it also serves as
an interesting critique of the
OED's times, the social values
that dominated and academic
projects that caught the atten
tion of the world.

If you have ever won
dered just who wrote the dic
tionary, The Professor and the
Madman is the book for you.
And even if you haven't pon
dered such deep questions, its
surprising answer tells an inter
esting story that is sure to make
anyone think.



Opinion
Letters to the Editor

A male feminist
fights back

Last week I wrote a re
sponse to a piece by Ms. Chris
tina Dickert, and in the days
immediately following its pub
lication I received many com
pliments and a lot ot support
from other logical people like
myself. Because of this tremen
dous amount of positive feed
back, I decided to restart my
neurological engines and write
another retort. God knows that
Ms. Dickert gave me an ample
supply of fuel.
I am deeply offended by
the very first sentence in Ms.
Dickert's column, "Women
Should Not Fear Feminism".
She begins by saying that, "I
expect insensitivity from men
about feminism." I am a man
and I consider myself to be a
feminist. No, your eyes do not
deceive you: I consider myself
to have strong feminist views
and I am damn proud of it. I
grew up with four older sisters.
I learned to respect women and
always treat them as equals.

I am disturbed that Ms.
Dickert addresses her article
solely to females and leaves out
the possibility of men being
part of the feminist movement.
She prejudges men simply on
the basis of their being men.
This is certainly not a good
feminist example to be setting.
One of the basic tenets of femi
nism is not to judge people by
their gender, but it seems as
though Ms. Dickert ignores this
idea. Her blatant disregard for

deeply-rooted feminist values,
like equality, is exactly why
many people consider her to be
a radical feminist. Her view is
not pro-woman; it is anti-man.
When Ms. Dickert asks, "Why
has feminism gotten such a bad
name?", the answer is simple.
Radical feminists like Ms.
Dickert do not promote
women's rights by pointing out
the positive aspects of the fe
male gender but instead seek to
defame males and claim
women to be victims. This so
called "feminism" is an insult

to both sexes: it stereotypes
men as insensitive while simul
taneously victimizing women
and generally implying they are
weak. Not only does Ms.
Dickert assume women are
naturally weak, but judging by
the way she talks down to them
in her article, it seems that she
views Gettysburg College fe
males as stupid. She writes
things like, "some women do
not realize that things can still
get better" and she puts down
another woman for her politi
cal views and her choice to be
a stay-at-home mom. Ms.
Dickert will not win many
women over to the feminist
cause if she continues to be so
condescending to them.

After she tells us that men
are evil and women are de
fenseless, Ms. Dickert proceeds
to give us all a history lesson in
women's studies. She provides
us great examples of feminist
leaders like Elizabeth Cady
Stanton. What she leaves out,
however, is that Elizabeth Cady
Stanton was not nearly as radi
cal as herself. Stanton pushed
for basic rights for women,
which, as far as I know, have
been secured for quite some
time in this country.
Ms. Dickert is fighting a
war that has already been won.
All she is accomplishing is forc
ing women to think and feel
that they are oppressed. When
people like Ms. Dickert stop
making women feel badly for
themselves, they will finally
realize all they have accom
plished instead of simply focus
ing on the negative.

The one major negative
that she points out is the dis
parity between the wages of
men and women. I will not
deny that men, on average,
earn more than women, but I
would like to state a reasonable
explanation for it, which will
also explain what can be done
about it. The highest-paid po
sitions in most companies are
held by men. However this is
not a result of sexism in today's
society. It is a result of past sex
ism that has carried over into
the present.

To simplify: the men who
are the CEOs of companies are
not in those positions because
they are men but because they
have more seniority. Why do
they have more seniority? Be
cause when many of them first
joined these companies a gen
eration ago, there were fewer
women working in these com
panies. Therefore, there are
fewer women who have the
seniority to be eligible for these
high positions today. I believe
that in another generation we
will see virtual equality among
men and women in all areas of
the workforce, without the "as
sistance" of people like Ms.
Dickert.

As a feminist, I am happy
to see the great achievements
of women in this century. I am
also glad to see that Ms.
Dickert was more honest in her
latest piece, even if her
thoughts are confused and big
oted and her tone patronizing.
Finally, I would like to send my
own message to the women of
Gettysburg College: do not buy
into Ms. Dickert's rhetoric.
Males are not all insensitive,
you are not all victims, and you
do not deserve to be talked
down to. Women can never
truly be equal to men as long
as people like Ms. Dickert con
tinue to put them down and
victimize them rather than em
power and inspire them.

Charles Schulz:
more than a
cartoonist
Last Sunday, February 13,
2000, a part of America was
lost when Charles Schulz, cre
ator of "Peanuts," passed away.
It happened, ironically, on the
date of the publication of his
last Sunday comic strip.
Schulz's art was comics,
yet he was a literary genius who
influenced our lives as pro
foundly as any great novelist.
Mr. Schulz, through the expe
riences of his sneaky, overly
mature gang of misfits, greeted
us daily and made us smile.
I wasn't a daily reader of

the "Peanuts" strip, but, un
knowingly, the Schulz gang has
always been a part of me. My
mother read me "Happiness is
a Warm Puppy," I cherished my
stuffed Snoopy toy, and I
owned the Halloween and
Christmas specials.
It was only after hearing
of Schulz's death and after
reading his last strip, that I dis
covered the degree of influence
that those quirky, oddly pro
portioned kids have had on my
life. I associated with the char
acters - they seemed like over
simplified representations of
my friends and myself. I em
braced their mishaps, subtle
messages and exaggerated per
sonal defects. Their foibles and
problems, however insignifi
cant, were mine.

"Peanuts" hasn't been
laugh-out-loud funny for 25
years—maybe it never was.
Recent strips are more cute
than hysterical. Why, then, do
Americans continue to embrace
"Peanuts" and read them reli
giously? It's because the char
acters have become an en
trenched part of our lives-they
are comforting and friendly,
and they are us. We're always
curious as to what they'll do
next because we're never sure
what we'll do next.
_% Upon reading Schulz's
farewell Sunday strip, I was
overcome with emotion. As
Bob Garfield of the Washing
ton Post put it, "Not Good
Grief! but real grief." A part
of my childhood - a part of me
- departed with Mr. Schulz. In
the words of the "Peanuts" cre
ator himself, "Charlie Brown,
Snoopy, Linus, Lucy how can
we ever forget them."

Remember Charlie
Brown on the football field,
eager and trusting. Lucy, always
deceitful, holds the football,
waiting to snatch it away and
send Charlie Brown airborne.
It is the quintessential "Pea
nuts" moment, one that always
induces a smile - the embodi
ment of everything we love
about the gang and everything
we understand about life.
Thank you, Mr. Schulz.

McCain: the
choice of a new
generation George W. Bush routed
John McCain in last Saturday's
South Carolina Primary, but
that defeat did not diminish
McCain's determination to win
the Michigan race. McCain
defeated Bush by seven point
margin there and touted a 24
point win in Arizona, his home
state. Responding to the 11
point defeat in South Carolina,
McCain delivered what many
political commentators called
the most aggressive concession
speech ever. Many Bush sup
porters considered the Texas
governor's win in S.C. to be a
righting of the wagon, a return
to normalcy after the huge vic
tory McCain achieved in New
Hampshire, but apparently
they were wrong.

McCain vowed to pursue
his Michigan campaign aggres
sively. He said, "I congratu
lated Governor Bush on his vic
tory here [Michigan] and
wished him a happy celebration
and a good night's rest. He's
going to need it."
It's easy to understand
why Bush might need a rest at
this point in the campaign, hav
ing revamped his approach so
many times. He began the

Consider This...

One of the biggest points of controversy during this year's presiden
tial campaign is tax cuts that would use some or all of the budget surplus
generated over the past two years. A large tax cut could significantly
impact the federal budget and the U.S. economy as a whole over the next
decade. While most voters would favor a large tax cut now, most don't
recognize the problems that might cause a little ways down the road.
A large tax cut would eliminate the government's ability to repay the
debt and would leave the budget still dependent on income from taxes.

Letters to the Editor

The Greek system gone
wrong In his letter ("Let the backlash
begin") in the February 17 issue of The
Gettysburgian, Mr. Chris Alworth takes
offense at derogatory comments that
seem to be circulating about Greek or
ganizations. At one stage in his letter,
Mr. Alworth asks ". . . .at what point
did the Greek system change from a tra
dition treasured by its members to an
outdated tumor on a campus that has
long been defined by the positive ac
tions of that very system?" I assume this

was not meant to be only a rhetorical
question, so I'll suggest points at which
the change may have occurred.
Perhaps it was in the early 1960s
when fraternities and sororities be
grudgingly were forced to comply with
civil rights legislation regarding the se
lection of new members without regard
to ethnicity. Or maybe it was during
the early 1970s when the housemoth
ers left the fraternities and the alcohol
flowed like water many nights each
week. Or maybe it was in the late 1970s
when members of one fraternity partici
pated in a gang-rape of a first-year

woman.
Perhaps it was in the middle 1980s
when some sorority pledges were forced
to undergo debasing acts before mem
bers of an allied fraternity as part of an
initiation rite. Come to think it, maybe
it was in the 1990s when four or five
fraternity houses were trashed by their
members for incomprehensible reasons.
Or, it is possible that the change may
have been accelerated a few years back
when a couple of dozen fraternity mem
bers got an equal number of first-year
students drunk enough to necessitate
trips to the emergency room at The
Gettysburg Hospital.
These represent just a few of the
points at which the change in attitude
toward the system may have taken
place. On the other hand, the negative

view of the Greek system may have its
roots in the nineteenth century when
the wrong skin color or religious belief
automatically excluded a person from
membership in a fraternity or sorority.
I hope this letter provides a satis
factory answer to Mr. Alworth's ques
tion. Alex T. Rowland '53

Three weeks ago I spoke out
about the incident involving Peter
North _copying down names of those
students who ordered books through
online dealers. In the subsequent weeks,
I have read in this fine newspaper the
responses of both Peter North and Kim
Wolf. I am writing this letter in reac
tion not only to that article, but to the
many people who have expressed out
rage over the incident.

In the article in the February 10
edition oiTbe Gettysburgian, Kim Wolf
mentioned that she made an attempt to
form a committee to determine what the
College book store can do to better their
position in the textbook buying war.
After exhaustive research through the
digest archives available on CNAV, I
found the letter she mentioned on the
January 27, 2000 digest. While going
through these articles, I realized that
Kim Wolf is an experienced digest
poster, seeing messages ranging from
this committee letter to the selling of
Beanie Babies. I am also an experienced
digest poster. I know that in order to
get any decent response to a message it
has to be posted not once, but several
times, usually for at least a week.
Apparently, receiving three re
sponses to her initial message did not
spur Kim to post any more, but fell short

First, let me just say that
I am no therapist and that I
know very little about the hu
man mind or its potential for
destruction. Well, I know that
post office employees and Tex
ans sometimes go a little hay
wire, and I also know as much
not to piss off d Xerox em
ployee in Hawaii. Along this
same "mental fitness" line is an
issue near and dear to my frag
ile heart known simply as the

stress and anxiety which many
of my fellow classmates are
feeling as a result of graduat
ing. This stress is caused by
the few remaining days until
our sheltered little Gettysburg
lives will be over and we will
be thrust out into tire cold
world alone, afraid and with
out hope. We are helpless little
bunnies, grazing now on the
plain of Stine Lake, but soon
the nasty little German Shep
herd called "real life" will come

and snatch us bv the neck, np
pmg and _teaung until oui little
bunny head pops clean off. Or
is that what the government
and your parents leally want
you to think?
I understand why people
aie a little bit nervous about
this whole transition, but at the
same time, you can't look at
everything as a prelude to di
saster. I mean, just because we
are leaving school doesn't mean
that all of the sudden our whole
lives change for the worse. If
your whole life does, then I am

sorry, but your time here
couldn't have been all
that great to begin with. —«
Things change,
but they don't have to be _^ ,—
for the worse. It's that
whole crisis: danger/op
portunity thing that you
learn in leadership semi
nars. The average graduating
student is somewhere between
21 and 22 years of age, which
is, last time I checked, pretty
young. It is not like the life ex
pectancy has dropped to some
where near fortv and all of the

sudden )ou and I aie middle
aged I know that, peisonally, I
am sick of people asking me
what I am doing next yeai and
the like. Moieover, I am

of authority. I don't know ex

but 1 do know that my Gettys
buig degiec will at least pay the
bills wheievei I do decide to go.
If it doesn't, then Gordon

time when we can just do what

"" _"_^ staring at numbers
and contemplating what
brand of canned corn to buy at
the supermarket on the way
home. Am I the only one out
there that thinks that is the
worst way to spend "the best
years of life?" Even money
isn't enough to keep me in such

a situation; money can't buy
back these next couple of years.
With money I can get a
nice fast cat, and now evidently
a wife on national TV, but it is
hard to replace the dream of
being flexible and free. Now I
know that some of you can't
function without a plan, and I
know that so many have been
working diligently on resumes
and applications and I am not
criticizing that (so Career Plan
ning doesn't hate me).
The average person now
switches professions almost too
many times to count in a life
time, and this is not the same
job market our parents went
into. The economy is great,
and we come from a liberal arts
background so there are a num
ber of things that any one of us
can do. All I am suggesting is
not to worry too much about
life after graduation because,
like anything, it is what you
make of it.

Life isn't about figures or
interest rates, it's about happi
ness and substance. A good
majority of people never find
either, but it is the fight that
really counts. Why don't we
all just take a deep breath and
try to do what we really want
to do these next few years? In
the big scheme of everything,
the first job doesn't matter too
much - except for the people
with too much ambition who,
like Brutus, often stab their best
friend in the back.
Often, things have a way
of working out financially in

one way or another, and the
bills usually get paid. Well,
your credit sucks and your girl
friend leaves you, and some
landlord in a sharkskin suit
might come after you with a
razor, but he probably will let
you off with keeping the rest
of those fingers. Most impor
tant is to calm down and stop
asking so many questions be
cause they just make everyone
nervous, especially my friend
Jenny (to whom this column is
dedicated), and no matter
what, we are all in the same
boat on the nasty sea of luck.

Illegal actions
- continuedfrom page 11 -

of her goal of ten students for
her committee. I sent out mes
sages about her e-mail for over
a week and heard from two of
the three students that con
tacted her; apparently Wolfe
planned to take no action until
she had ten students. Since that
number was never reached, the
three who did respond never
heard from her again.
I find the lack of effort
put into this committee appall
ing. If she truly wanted to form
a student committee, any expe
rienced poster to the digests
would continue posting until
ten responses were received.
Three responses to one mes
sage is a very good number, but
Kim did not pursue it. Why
that is, I do not know. After
two failed attempts to procure
names from the post office
staff, could she have found her
own methods to get those
names without IKON ap
proval?

Now on to Peter North.
His intrusion into the postal
realm occurred exactly one
week- after Kim Wolf sent her
message to the digest. North
claims that his reason for col
lecting these names was to form
the bookstore committee. Af
ter two failed attempts to break
students' privacy and a lame
digest attempt to get students
for a committee, North took
advantage of his position with

the college and violated exactly
that privacy which the post of
fice workers were trying to pro
tect. North went on to deny
that there was any foul play in
volved. No foul play? Some
of these online booksellers use
the United States Postal Service
to ship these items, and after
explaining what happened at
the College, an agent for the
Federal Postal Service said what
North did was highly illegal, let
alone unethical.

To allay anyone's fears, I
will say that this agent was not
a member of the Postal Police,
so there is no criminal investi
gation. I am sorry to tell Peter
North that the ends do not jus
tify the means. If the students
wanted you to know that they
bought online textbooks, they
would have responded to Kim's
e-mail, now wouldn' t they?
I want to close this letter
with two points. The first is
that I have no personal ven
detta against the College Book
store, Kim Wolf or Peter North.
I couldn't even pick Peter
North out of a lineup, at least
not Gettysburg's Peter North.
I completely understand that
the bookstore, as does any busi
ness, has the right to be com
petitive in a free enterprise sys¬

tem. I do not deny the fact that
the bookstore is losing money
due to the "loaning" of text
books by the students. But that

does not mean they can resort
to illegal means to prevent fur
ther loss of profits. This is
where I come to my last point.
When I sent out my di
gest posts, I got several re
sponses from students express
ing their outrage. I also must
applaud Judy Jones of the Phys
ics/ES department for writing
a letter to the paper last week.
I now call on all those who
have contacted me to express
your outrage in a more public
setting. Contact an administra
tor or write letters to the pa
per or to the digests - do some
thing. I do not want to see these
two fired over this, but they
should at least have a letter put
into their permanent files;
something to show that the
administration cares about
what students think. I close
with this question: who
watches the watchers? We do.

Beyond (re)production

by Rachel Hanson
Columnist
What do you think of
when you see a woman? Do
you see her as a human being,
deserving of human rights? Do
you see her as someone who
can make decisions for herself
and her life?
Many of us have recently
"forgotten" that women are
people and are capable of mak
ing wise and responsible deci
sions. Instead, women are seen
as incubators for fetuses. They

are seen as so irresponsible and
untrustworthy that they need
others to tell them what to do.
When recently asked to
name his favorite female come
dian, Jerry Lewis replied, "I
don't like any female comedi
ans." When questioned for say
ing this, Lewis explained fur
ther, adding, " A woman doing
comedy doesn't offend me, but
sets me back a bit. I, as a
viewer, have trouble with it. I
think of her as a producing ma
chine that brings babies in the
world."

Lewis later tried to apolo
gize, after realizing that his
Muscular Dystrophy Associa
tion telethon would be nega
tively affected by his rude and
obnoxious remarks. He said
that "There are times when
half-statements get misinter
preted, and that's what hap
pened."
If Lewis' comments were
only a "half-statement," I
would hate to hear other opin
ions Lewis may have about
women in general. I also do
not understand why Lewis feels
that his comments were "mis
interpreted." There really is
only one way to interpret "I
think of her as a producing
machine that brings babies in
the world."

Once he realized that the
very women he disrespects give
money to his beloved cause, he
knew he had better apologize,
even though it was only a half
hearted apology and placed the

blame on the media rather than
the moron who actually made
the comment.
Last week, a Montana
judge ordered a woman who
took drugs while pregnant not
to get pregnant for ten years.
Dawn Marie Sprinkle will have
to take a pregnancy test every
two months, and if she should
test positive, she could be put
in jail. I realize and understand
the fact that taking drugs is il
legal and Sprinkle should be

punished accordingly for
breaking that law. However,
being forced to take pregnancy
tests as part of her sentence is
not only inappropriate, but also
ridiculous.
Does this case mark the
beginning of the government
being able to tell women what
they can and cannot do while
pregnant? I surely hope not.
Women are currently warned
of the dangers of consuming a
number of things while preg
nant and they should be trusted
to listen to these warnings.

Had Sprinkle been spot
ted drinking wine while preg
nant, should she have been or
dered to not become pregnant
for five years? Three years for
smoking a cigarette? Two years
for consuming a caffeinated
beverage? Hopefully, no such
rulings will ever occur. But
they are simple extensions of
the ruling that was handed
down last week.
Ordering Sprinkle to not
become pregnant for ten years
had nothing to do with the
crime she committed. She took
drugs and she should have been
punished for that and that
alone. While many states have
tried to expand their child-pro
tection laws to cover fetuses,
they are almost always struck
down by some reasonable per
son who realizes that fetuses
are not children.

To the best of my knowl
edge, there is no law in Mon
tana saying that a woman can
be penalized for causing harm
to the fetus inside of her. By

being forced to not get preg
nant and take periodic preg
nancy tests, Sprinkle is being
punished for just that. In other
words, a judge is say- ing that
this woman has vio- ^^^
lated a law that _^^^L
does not exist! _^^^V

On the
cusp of the i
twenty-first J
century, many _^
people still seefl
women as no- i
thing besides I
procreators. j
Still more be
lieve that the
rights and inter
ests of the fetus
should be held in
higher regard
than those of
the impregnated _'
women who are (in

theory, at least) people and
citizens of this country.
Women, just like men,
have a number of purposes out
side of reproduction. Those
who hold opinions such as
Jerry Lewis' are among the
most abominable members of
our society. Their opinions
translate to women only being
useful for the reproductive de
sires of men. To hold women
in such light not only shows
complete hatred of women and
disregard of their rights, but
also a general disrespect for the
entire human race.
Those who place rights
for fetuses above the rights of
women should be among the
most feared and distrusted
members of society. They are
the ones who will try to dic
tate what a pregnant woman
can and cannot do, putting the
"rights" of an inviable fetus
above the rights of a living and
breathing person.

Until all of society real
izes that women are people and
not "a producing machine that
brings babies in the world,"
women will continue to be op
pressed. Until women gain the
respect they deserve, everyone,
men AND women, will suffer.

Hijack an election? Is
that possible? Why does Bush
fear McCain's crossover vote
appeal? Isn't it a good thing
when more people take inter
est in a primary? Wouldn't a
larger voter base qualify as bet
ter democracy?
Last year many states
changed over to the open pri
mary system in hopes of gar
nering part of the independent
vote for Bush. The reasoning
was that, in comparison to
Steve Forbes, Bush would seem
more moderate; the republican
establishment didn't count on
John McCain.

Now Bush denounces
McCain for not being heavily
supported by the conservative
component of the GOP, and
caters to the ultraconservatives
like those at Bob Jones Univer

perament of a potential presi
dent, but of a bitter individual.
John McCain has called
George W. Bush as untrustwor
thy as Bill Clinton. Why, then,
do hardly any of McCain's col
leagues support him?
In Michigan, Republicans
voted nearly 70% for George
W Bush, but to win in Novem
ber Bush, like Reagan, needs to
rally Republicans, indepen
dents, and conservative Demo
crats around his banner. In
Michigan, independents and
Republicans supported Bush,
while Democrats came out for
McCain. Supporters of liberal
Michigan Congressman John
Conyers were calling on behalf
of McCain to help embarrass
the Governor of Michigan
John Engler and Governor
Bush.

These people are not
Reagan Republicans, they are
Clinton/Gore Democrats who
were told that since Michigan
had no Democratic Primary
that they should go and hurt
the Republican Party. John

Does Bush want the party to
stagnate? Is isolation of the
current faithfuls and exclusion
of any new ideas the key to a
better party?
Doubtful.
McCain wants the party
to grow and expand. He wants
reforms within the party to fa
cilitate growth and to make
compromise with liberals pos
sible for the good of the coun
try. McCain said that he wants
to build a "coalition that pre¬

serves our prin
ciples but attracts to our ban
ner people who are Democrats,
Libertarian, vegetarian, we
want them all."
He especially seeks to in
volve younger conservative
thinkers in this movement and
is highly rated among college
students. McCain possesses the
ability to do the most impor
tant thing a president can do -
rally a new generation of
Americans to put their country
above themselves.
Steven Spicer '00

McCain is not building the Re
publican Party, he has become
a tool for outside interest to
destroy the GOP.
A final note about the
Senator of Arizona, if enough
Democrats give him the Repub
lican nomination then you can
expect a mass excursion out of
the Republican Party by the
base of the party to Pat
Buchanan and the Reform
Party. Without our base we can
defeat Al Gore who will have a
strong economy to run on. The

liberals in Michigan will go
back to Gore while we lose the
conservatives in our own party.
By running as a compas
sionate conservative, George
W Bush in a race against Vice
President Gore will be able to
bring much of the Reagan coa
lition home, while being con
servative enough to keep the
base of our party together. Af
ter conservatives have fought
successfully to nominate Gov
ernor Bush in the primary, they
will stay with him in the gen
eral. •

Returning honor and dignity to the
Presidency

tvom the Lomermtive _iovnei

by Dan Ballentyne
Columnist
After the disgraceful,
scandal-ridden, morals-lacking
Clinton Administration, one of
the most important issues, if
not the most important issue,
is who among the candidates
can restore the honor and dig
nity of the office of the Presi
dency.
Of the five remaining
candidates, four of them can
and would do just that. They
are Governor George W. Bush,
Senator John McCain, Ambas
sador Alan Keyes, and former
Senator Bill Bradley. Not only
is Al Gore incapable of restor
ing the honor and dignity of the
office, but he has diminished it
in his current office.

Governor Bush has a
record of dignified office hold
ing. For the last 5 years he has
been Governor of the state of
Texas, and in that time has had
no scandals arise concerning
him. The one attempt by the
media to create a scandal
fizzled out from lack of evi
dence and lack of truth.
He made promises to cut
taxes, to reform education and
the judicial system and to cut
crime. He kept all those prom
ises with the two largest tax

cuts m Texas history, raised the
grades of Texan children, had
tort reform and cut the crime
rate across the board.
As I am sure many of you
know, or have been able to fig
ure out from my other articles,
I am not a fan of Senator
McCain. I think he is far too
moderate on too many issues.
But be that as it may, when
McCain takes a stand on an is
sue, you know that that is what
he stands for and will fight for,
and I respect that. McCain has
had a scandal in his past but,
unlike the Clinton, he admits
it and says he was wrong. Mr.
Clinton and other Democrats,
note this because it is the right
thing to do when one makes a
mistake.

I'm sure that those of you
who have heard Alan Keyes and
know what Alan Keyes stands
for know that Keyes would
bring honor and dignity to the
office. He believes very
strongly in morality and ethics
and dignity, and would bring
them to the Presidency. It is a
national shame that Mr.
Clinton and Mr. Gore don't.
As I'm sure many of you
already know, I would never in
a million years vote for Bill Bra
dley. I think his program is too
far left and would not really
help the American people. But,

be that as it may, I can respect
Bill Bradley. He is honest. I can
say I know where he stands on
the issues. I can say for sure that
there are no Chntonesque scan
dals in his past waiting to spring

on us. He runs an ethical cam
paign, he does not get personal
or accuse people of being un
caring for disagreeing with
him, unlike the President, Vice
President or some others closer
to home who speak for the
Democratic Party or liberalism.
Of course, this is because Sena
tor Bradley has something con
structive to say and those who
get personal do not.
I look forward to a debate
between my party's nominee
and Senator Bradley, because I
know it would be an intellec
tual debate on issues and ideas,
not one where the Gore would
smear and denigrate with per
sonal attacks and insult the in
telligence of the American
people and the integrity of the
political process.

Al Gore, like Bill Clinton,
is a national disgrace. He is
deeply involved in the fund
raising scandals of the 1996
Democratic campaigns which
led to the Chinagate scandal.
He has backed a bigot in the
name of Donna Brasile, whom
former Massachusetts Gover¬

nor Michael _^^^^^^H
Dukakis fired ^^^^^H
for similarly re- _^^^H
pugnant remarks. _^^H
He smears his oppo- ^^™
nents as bad people, he
has said that Republicans want
to kill people. He even went as
far as to say Bill Bradley was a
bigot by deliberately hurting
minorities with his program.
He has no shame when it comes
to attacking his opponents, and
America deserves better.
Also, unlike all his oppo¬

nents he has flip-flopped on
every issue. In the 1980s Al
Gore was Pro-life, Pro-gun and
Pro-tobacco, but when he ran
for President in 1988 he all of
a sudden became pro-abortion,
anti-gun and anti-tobacco. He
said the day Clinton was im
peached that he was the "great
est President of the century"
and when he was campaigning,
all of the sudden he said
Clinton was wrong. There are
many other examples of Gore's
flip-flopping, but I believe the
point has been made.

Al Gore does not deserve
to be President. We deserve a
President our children can look
up to, not one who is not a
national embarrassment. Bush,
McCain, Keyes, and Bradley
would not be. Gore is.

Opinion

the I_'iU'luidcnn's Pulpit McCain taints Republican Party

by John Dunlap
Political Columnls r
When the national media
is extremely excited about a
Republican lunnmg toi piesi
dent, you can bet that paiticu
lar Republican cannot be
trusted and does not share the
values and beliefs of the major
ity of the patty. Today, Sena
tor John McCain of Arizona is.

destroying the winning coali
tion that Ronald Reagan put
together in 1980 and f 984. He
is doing this by proposing a tax
plan that is almost as small as
Bill Clinton's proposal and
campaigning toi President us
ing the class wartate tactics of
Al Goie and Dick Gephaidt.
Eveiy Republican Govei
noi in the nation supports Gov
ernor Geoige W Bush of Texas
for pi esident because Governoi

Bush is a reformer with results.
He has been an executive of a
major state where he has cut
taxes, balanced budgets, re
formed education, and taken
on problems such as juvenile
crime. These Governors sup
port the Bush economic plan
because it will give the people
back moie of what they earn
by continuing to increase lev
enues which will pay down the
debt and save social security.
The McCain plan is a lib
eral class warfaie program that

keeps the surplus in Washing
ton where it can be spent away.
To truly reduce the size and
scope of the federal govern
ment and return more money
to localities, we need to get the
surplus out of the hands of
Congiess and the Washington
buieaucrats. On the issue ot
campaign finance reform, John
McCain'splan would hold Re
publicans hostage. The
McCain plan would allow or
ganized labor to de
stroy Repub¬

lican congressional candidates,
handing Congress back to the
Democrats. That in itself
would take us back to the days
of debates over socialized
medicine and how many taxes
should be incieased.
Governor Bush's plan fol
lows what many states have
done in their own legislatures
by preventing members of Con
gress from raising money from
lobbyists during congressional
sessions. This places a limit on
the special interest hold on
Washington. This is not in

John McCain's plan because
he has been on Capi
| _^^^ tal Hill for 18
_Hk years, and as
_A Chairman of the
_^^^^M Senate Com¬

merce Commit
tee has, as was
reported earlier
this year, made
calls on behalf of
lobbyists who -
before his com-

had business
mittee to investigators.
It says something about
John McCain when all but four
of his colleagues in the Senate
refuse to support him. They
do not trust him because he
seems to care more about be
ing the darling of the national
media than a fighter for con
servative reforms. In his home
state of Arizona, McCain's own
Governor Jane Hull questions
his temperament and says he
cannot be President.
Chairman McCain has
also shown himself to be a
hypocrite. While McCain and
the media criticized calls made
by Pat Robertson of the Chris
tian Coalition on Bush's behalf,
even though his campaign did
not know it calls were made for
McCain calling Bush an anti
Catholic. The Governor's
brother, Jeb and his family are
Catholics. How negative can
you get?

After McCain lost the
South Carolina primary, the
negative tone of his concilia
tory message was not the tem

Affirmative action confirms action is still necessary

by Christina Dickert
Political Columnist
This week another Bush
was in the headlines. Not
George, George W, or Melvin,
the latest addition to the hall
of candidates' funny brothers.
This week it was Jeb Bush,
George I's brother and the
governor of Florida. Jeb Bush
and his cabinet voted to elimi
nate affirmative action in re
gards to admission to the ten
state universities.
In its place, they passed a

program called "One Florida."
This program guarantees ad
mission to one of the state uni
versities if a student graduates
in the top 20 percent of their
class and takes a college prepa
ratory curriculum while in high
school. Bush believes that if
minorities can hack that, they
should not have to worry about
being accepted.
This is hypocritical.
Schools cannot be filled if they
only accept the top 20 percent
of students. Other spaces will
have to be filled by students

who are not in the top 20 per
cent. How will students be dis
tinguished then?
In August, a group of re
jected applicants decided to sue
the University of Michigan.
They believe that they were
rejected because of their race.
The would-be students main
tained that they knew minor
ity students who had lower
grades and were less active in
extracurricular activities
than they were, but who
were admitted to the Uni
versity of Michigan. The I

rejected students were bit- /
ter about this and decided m
to sue the school.
In 1973, Alan Bakke_, a
white student, decided to sue
the University of California
Davis Medical School because
he was not accepted. He be
lieved that it had to do with his
race. The Supreme Court ruled
that it was unacceptable for
schools to have racial quotas,
but they also said that it was
important to consider the di
versity of the student body.
Justice Lewis Powell said that
"the goal of achieving a diverse

student body is sufficiently
compelling to justify consider
ation of race."
Unfortunately, many
people disagree with that.
People are close-minded when
it comes to affirmative ac
tion. They believe that W
affirmative action _^ _>
means "minorities Mm

ma

_^ ^» _^ _B
action is not like
that. When comparing appli
cations for jobs or schools and
the like, affirmative action is
applied when there are two
equally-qualified applicants.
Then race or gender is brought
in to distinguish between the
two. Some white men have a
fear of affirmative action since
they see themselves as the "vic
tims." What kind of victims are

white men? Since the begin
ning of time, and most defi
nitely since the birth of our
nation, white men have been
the most privileged group in

e.
Affirmative action is
NOT filling quotas — it is
giving groups that are not as
privileged a chance to move
up in the social strata.
_B_\ Affirmative action
_™ should not be seen as spe
cial treatment of minorities.
Instead it should be viewed as
a stepping-stone for equal
treatment. Once minorities are
seen as equal to whites affirma
tive action can be eliminated.
But until then, affirmative ac
tion should be kept in place.
Jeb Bush's new legislative
action will not only affect
Florida's higher education but
other aspects of Florida's
economy. Many African
American groups, as well as af
firmative action supporters, are
threatening to ban Florida
products, like Florida oranges
and orange juice.
The repercussions of the
abolishment of affirmative ac¬

tion in Florida will be far
reaching. I know that many of
you are still probably in doubt
about the whole issue of affir
mative action, but listen to me.
Over winter break, I went back
to my high school. It is very
similar to Gettysburg in terms
of diversity.
While I was at my high
school, I sat on a panel of other
students who were now in col
lege. One African-American
woman came back. She is now
attending a historically-black
university in Virginia. One of
the students asked her why
there aren't any historically
white colleges, and why her
school should be so special.
She answered by saying that
there are historically-white col
leges: every college or univer
sity that refused to accept black
students. We just don't call
them that.

So while we sit here at
our historically-white institu
tion, with our more than pre
dominantly-white student
body, I challenge you to look
at affirmative action in another
light.

Senior Reflections: The best in Bullet athletics

by Josh Eyler
Staff Writer
With the end of my senior
wrestling season comes the re
alization that my involvement
with Gettysburg athletics has
effectively come to a close.
However, the four years that I
have spent here as a student-

athlete have left an indelible
impression on the person that
I have become. I have many
fond memories, not simply of
the time that I have spent here,
but of the other examples of
athletic fortitude that I have
witnessed. Some memories
excellent, some poignant, they
all have made my Gettysburg
experience unique. So it hap¬

pens that I would like to share
with you my top five memories
of the athletic program at Get
tysburg College.
5. The outstanding per
formance of the women's field
hockey team these past two
years. They worked diligently
from simply being a contender
to becoming one of the best in
the division. Special kudos to

Steph Fisher who set the all
time record for goals scored.
4. The consistently re
markable play of the men's la
crosse team. While I couldn't
see as many games as I would
have liked, they lived up to
their reputation as one of the
best programs in the confer
ence, and indeed, the division.
3. The three-time Ail
American performance of
wrestler Jake Dell. Although
he graduated two years ago,
many of us are still amazed at
the dedication and heart that
he put into a career that has
turned out to be the most out
standing in Gettysburg wres
tling history. He holds a large
portion of the team's records,
including most pins and most
victories. His achievments
were envied by athletes not
only in wrestling, but all sports
as well.

would be the person that he is
off the field. What a career.
1. The last home wres
tling match of Chris Clifford.
I was a sophomore, but I re
member this clearly. After win
ning his final home bout, Chris
ran over to his family and gave
them an enormous hug for all
the love and support that they
had given him. Though he is
gone, we can still remember the
person that he was with in
stances like this. He was all
heart and pride, and he will be
remembered as such.

2. The outstanding ca
reer of Paul Smith. Who could
have thought that the fullback
from Ventor, New Jersey would
have become one of the most

piohfic players to ever touch a
football? Besides owning
nearly every running related
team record, Paul owns the all
time record for all-purpose
yards in Division III and just
missed winning it for all three
divisions. Paul's achievments
are only topped by the fact that
he is so humble about them.
He credits his offensive line
with his gains and his team with
all of his success. Perhaps, then,
the only thing that would ever
eclipse his gains in football

Lady Bullets finish with a win over Dickinson

From Si mi Rii'oim
Jamie Dawson scored a
career-high 20 points in hei h
rul collegiate game and sopho
more Steph Drevna M.\dcd 14
points to lead Gettysburg past
Dickinson 56-50 last Saturday.
Dawson poured in 17 or
her 20 points in the second half
and finished the game shooting
8-for-9 from the flooi before
fouling out with 3:09 remain
ing. Drevna scored 12 of her
14 points in the first half and
dished out a team-high four
assists to help the Bullets snap
a season-high fourgame losing
streak.
Gettysburg nevei trailed
on the afternoon and led by as
many as 1 1 points in the first
half before watching Dickinson
fight back to tie the game at 37
with 12:24 remaining.

Dawson s putback at the
11:17 mark pur the Bullets
ahead to stay and Mandy Wil
son drilled a 12-foot pull-up
jumper to make it 41-37 with
10:40 left.
Dickinson pulled within

41-40, but Dievna hit a dnv
mg layup acioss the lane and
Dawson followed with a thiee
pomt play to push the Gettys
buig lead back to 46-40.
The Red Devils went on
a 7-2 run to pull within 48-47,
but again Dawson answered by
hitting a turnaround jumper
and then canning two fi ee
throws to push the Gettysburg
lead back to 52-47 before foul
ing out with 3:09 to play.
With their top scorer on
the bench, the Bullets re
sponded by holding Dickinson
scoreless over the next three

.
Gettysburg also failed to
find the basket down the
stretch until sophomore Kelsey
Williams knocked down four
tree throws in the game's final
28 seconds to seal the victory.
The Bullets threatened to
run away with the game in the
early stages, outscoring
Dickinson 10-0 over the first
four minutes and 23 seconds
before Brady put the Red Dev
ils on the board with a 12-foot
jumper with 13:35 left in the

tirst halt.
Behind 12 points ti om
Drevna, Gettysbuig pushed its
lead to 27-16 before Dickinson
went on a 10-0 run to pull
within 27-26 in the early stages
or the second half.
Dawson was rewarded
for her efforts by being named
to the Centennial Conference
Weekly Honor Roll. Post-sea
son accolades poured in for the
Gettysburg women this past
week. Carrie Kulp was a sec
ond team all-Centennial Con
ference selection. Dawson and
Drevna made honorable men¬

tion. The Dickinson game
marked the end of three bril
liant careers. In addition to
Dawson, Kulp and Megan
McDonald will also be gradu
ating. Kulp's ability to score
inside and outside will be
missed, as will the versatile,
athletic play of McDonald.

Coach Mike Kirkpatrick to fill.

Wrestlers finish second in CC

by Richard Lukas
Staff Writer
Two weeks ago, the Get
tysburg College wrestling team
concluded an exceptional dual
meet season, tying Western
Maryland for their first-ever
Centennial Conference title.
_fcJnder the guidance of Head
Coach Troy Dell and Assistant
Coach Jake Deil, the Bullets
headed to Johns Hopkins on
Saturday to compete in the CC
Championships.
A large Gettysburg con
tingency, comprised of families
and students alike, followed the
team to Baltimore. With only
one loss on their CC sheet, the
Bullets were poised for a good
showing-

Improving upon a fourth
place finish from last year, Get
tysburg took second on the day
with two national qualifiers,
Steve Kareha (133) and Chris
Beck (174).

Overall, the team com
peted strongly, placing five
wrestlers in the last round of
the championships.
After a first-round bye,
freshman Steve Kareha won a
6-5 semifinal decision over
Kevin Greco of Ursmus Col
lege. Then, in perhaps one of
the most exciting matches of
the day, Kareha pinned Brian
Frank (Johns Hopkins) in 2:02,
winning the first gold medal for
Gettysburg.
Senior captain Chris Beck

collected the day's second and
only other individual champi
onship. With a commanding
10-1 major decision over Mike
Halchak (Johns Hopkins), Beck
moved on to the semifinals.
There, he pinned Greg Jacobs
(Muhlenberg) in an impressive
2:17. Demonstrating "bags of
skill", he captured the champi
onship with a 9-2 decision over
Ursinus's Torn Flud.
With three additional sil
ver medals, the Bullets secured
68 points on the clay. Sopho¬

more Tim Scrapato (157) took
second place, falling 15-6 to
Rob Johns oi Western Mary
land. J unior Morgan Douglas
(184) captured a silver medal,
losing 14-4 to Charlie Conway
(Western Maryland) in the
championship bout. Senior
Shawn Greene (hwt) picked up
the last silver of the day, falling
to Muhlenberg_'s Tyler Cathey
in the finals.
Despite Gettysburg's
many wins on the day, the team
placed 34.5 points behind first
place Western Maryland. The
season is not quite over for ev
eryone. Kareha and Beck quah
fied for nationals, while
Scarpato seized an alternate's
bid. A handful of athletes will
continue to train with the
qualifiers for nationals.

Kareha and Beck fly to
Ohio Northern University next
week for the NCAA Champi
onships (March 3-4). All of
Gettysburg College wishes
them the best!

Men's basketball posts double victory to end season

Senior Bill Davidson reaches 1000 points as illustrious career comes to a close

by Erik Bullwinkel
Staff Wri per
This season, the BuiJets
had a talented squad. After
encountering misfortune in the
season, they wanted to close
out the season on a winning
note. The last week of the sea
son did not provide an easy
slate for the Bullets as they
faced Centennial Conference
contenders Ursinus and
Dickinson.
In their final home con
test of the season, the Bullets
defeated the Ursinus Bears 79
73. The win was the seventh
consecutive home victory for
the Bullets and ended a four
game winning streak for the
_Rears.

Besides pride and the
simple goal of winning, there
was another challenge on the
line for the team. Senior co
captain Bill Davidson entered
the contest 20 points shy of
1,000 for his career at Gettys
burg College. But his focus, as
well as the team's focus, was
still on winning the game.
The Bullets played strong
throughout, leading most of
the game and taking a 41-31
lead into the lockerroom.
With 13:13 remaining to
play the Bullets held a com
manding 56-39 lead. The
Bears then went on a 30 -12
lead to give them their only
lead of the game, 69-68. Dur
ing this stretch, Davidson
scored his 1,000th point, be
coming only the 17th player In
Gettysburg College history

toachieve the milestone.
Gettysburg took the lead
back for good at 70-69 with
2:48 remaining, as junior cen
ter Greg Schreiber converted
both free throws of a one and

one. Along with his mile
stone achievement, Davidson
led all Bullet scorers with 23
points. Senior co-captain
Ryan Napp added 22 points

and sophomore guard Curtis
_McNeill chipped in 15.
On Saturday, the Bullets
traveled to Carlisle to _fxe the
Dickinson Red Devils. The game
proved to be fast paced, and the

Bullets handled it well, emerg
ing with a 101-91 victory.
Gettysburg led by only
one pomt.it the half, 5 1-50, but
their tenacious play proved to
be too much for the Red Dev
ils in the second half.
As a team, Gettysburg
shot 58.2% from the field.
They also converted nine _ot 16
thiee point attempts, six of
which came from Napp.
The team's three seniors,

Davidson, Napp, and Rich
Pfeil, finished their careers in
style. Both Napp and
Davidson, who was named the
CC Player of the Week,
eclipsed the thirty point mark
in the game, scoring career
highs of 30 and 32 points, re
spectively. Pfeil scored points
100 and 101 on an alleyoop
dunk in the final ten seconds.
Also posting a career high
was sophomore reserve center
Kevin Boyle, who scored 16
points.

"We're happy to have
won the last three games of the
season," said Davidson. "But
we're not happy with the sea
son as a whole. We feel we
were good enough to make the
playoffs and fell short."
The Bullets hnished the
season 15-9, 8-5 in the CC, just
short of a spot in the playoffs.
Davidson was named to the all
Centennial Conference second

team. While the team will miss
graduating seniors Davidson,
Napp, and Pfeil next season,
there is a wealth or talented
underclassmen who saw signifi
cant action this season and look
to improve in 2001.

Bullets on track for conference championships

by Lauren Davis
Assistant Sports Editor
In spite of last Friday's
sleet and icy road conditions,
the Bullets track team made the
trek to Kutztown University
last weekend to face some non
conference competition, in
cluding the meet's host and
Shippensburg University, both
Division II institutions.
The trip was not made in
vain, as several athletes turned
in excellent performances to

qualify for the Centennial Con
ference meet this weekend.
Although there was no
team scoring, both the men's
and women's teams looked
promising in all events.
The women tallied 11
top-six performances through
the course of the evening.
Anne Schenck led the Bullets
with a 17_'7" leap in the long
jump, good for first place, and
a second-place high jump
(5_'3"). Gettysburg gained two
third place finishes from its dis¬

tance crew, with junior Tracy
Swackhamer running 5:45.5
in the mile and sophomore
Lauren Davis completing the
3000 in 11:02.2.
The Lady Bullets also
shone in the sprints, led by se
nior captain Andi Them's
fourth-place finishes in the 55
(7.67) and 200 (27.43).
First-year Joanna Silver
and junior Ken Hymen con
tributed fourth and fifth
place performances in the
400 with times of 1:03.25
and l;03.49, respectively.

In the held, senioi Eiika
Durst's 9-0 pole vault placed hei
third, while classmate Cathy
Spangler put the shot 34' 6 1/2"
to take fifth.
The men's team fared
nearly as well as the women, col
lecting ten top-six finishes, led by
third-place performances from
juniors Jon Catlett, Jason Rose,
and Jeff Cumpson.
Catlett and Rose both ran
solid strategic races in distance
events, Catlett completing the
mile in 4:31.7 and Rose running
9:09.9 in the 3000, while

Cumpson's 53.01 in the 400
meter dash placed him half a
second behind two Kutztown
athletes.
The men also looked
strong in the field, where
sophomore Chris Russo high
jumped 5'11" to take fourth
place and juniors Will
Hannema and jere Dee picked
up fifth-place finishes in the
pole vault and shot put, respec
tively.

Championships at Franklin 8c
Marshall.
The three
day meet was a
long and tiring
battle-to-the
end for both the
men and the
women. When
the last race was
won, the Lady
Bullets' record
of never having
lost a meet in the
Centennial Con
ference was still

. However,
the outcome of
the men's meet
was not in
Gettysburg's fa
vor as the Bullets
lost their first
championship since the
conference's in
ception. The fi
nal score was
heartbreakingly
close as the men

6c Marshall,
6R3-700.

The women took the champion
ship with a score of 697, followed the Centennial Conference record in the

Seven of the women have quali
fied for NCAA's with the "B" qualify

the utmost respect," said Olmsted.

stellar perfor
mances in all of his
events. He pulled
in a second place
finish in the 100
freestyle, and fin

was also on the 400
free relay, and the
800 free relay.
