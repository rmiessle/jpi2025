Whether it is housing, programs, din
ing, or other options, Gettysburg has
stepped up to the plate.
"It's all about flexibility," said
Tim Rupe, Associate Dean and Direc
tor of Residential Life. The college has
made vast additions to its housing op
tions to give students the flexibility and
the administration room to make
changes.
The Appleford Inn was pur
chased by the college this summer and
is now occupied by 20 women. The
Colonial Motel is also being leased

giving at least 40 students a place to stay.
"Everyone is _benefiting from the
influx of new students. From first years
to upperclassmen, the students are ben
efitting more rather than losing from
enrollment growth," stated Julie Ramsey,
Dean of Students.
The sophomores are in that bridge
of housing where they are going from
dorms to more upperclass style apart
ments, Rupe pointed out, and the Colo

place in between. The Motel will be
ready for the students within a week to

10 days.
The Quarry Suites residential halls,
now under construction, are on sched
ule, according to Rupe, and will be ready
by students by January 2000.
Huber Hall will be vacated this
spring for "nuts and bolts" renovations.
These students will be moving into the
Quarry Suites which will also be occu
pied by students returning from study
abroad programs, as well as by a variety
of other students.
"We always need flexibility within
our program. We make sure everyone
here has a bed and has a room. We al
ways try to maintain a two percent va
cancy of beds so we can have room for

change," said Rupe.
Besides housing changes, dining
options have also been expanded.
There are 30 more students on a Din
ing Hall meal plan and accomadations
have been made to benefit them and the

rest of the student body.
A new grab-and-go continental
breakfast tent is located in front of
Masters Hall that offers students an al
ternative to a sit-down breakfast. Yo
gurt, fruit, donuts, and drinks are
among the food available. It is open
from 7:30 a.m.-10:00 a.m. Monday

something that, according to Dean
Ramsey, can't necessarily be controlled.

Fall Sports Preuiew

Gettysburg's fall sports season
begins this week with great promise and
expectation. Of the athletes returning,
seven were All-Americans last season
and four were Centennial Conference
Players of the Year. Three teams will
be defending their conference champi
onships and the other four figure to be
in the hunt to upend last year's cham
pion. The following are capsule summa
ries of the seven fall sports teams:

Football
Head Coach: Barry Streeter, 22nd Sea
son Last Year's Record: 3-7
Key Players lost: Justin Domingos (DE),
Mike Holm (TE), Justin Ogorek (OG),
Jeff Closz (SE), Rob Crowe (SE).
Key Returning Players: Bill Beining
(OT), senior; Scott Grabus (DE), senior;
Kevin Katch (DT), junior; Gene Kraus
(DT), senior; John Bianchi (OG), jun
ior; Ryan Moore (LB), sophomore;
Matt Helwig (HB), senior; Bryan
Pojanowski (HB/K), junior; Dennis
Flaherty (QB), junior; Wes Wells (QB),
senior; Mike Karp (T), sophomore;
Chris Matthaei (G), junior; B. J.
Edwards ( C), sophomore; Jeff Boyd

Senior Paul Smith is 193 yards shy of breaking the all-time
Gettysburg rushing record.

(SE), junior; Chris Lunardi (DB), senior.
Outlook: With a veteran backfield and
a steadily improving defensive unit,
Head Coach Barry Streeter is upbeat
heading into his 22nd season with the
Bullets.
"The sky's the limit with this
group this season and I really believe
that because of their attitude," said
Streeter, who will tie the legendary Hen
Bream this season for longest coaching
tenure. "Comine into the preseason,

we've set a number of goals on offense
and defense, but it starts with being fo
cused."
Gettysburg returns 31 letterwiners
and 18 starters from last year's 3-7
squad, none of whom will wear a big
ger target when the season starts than
fullback Paul Smith.
The senior co-captain broke pro
gram records for carries (293) and yards
in a season (1,515) last year while scor
ing 12 touchdowns and earning All
America honors.
"The league will be tough and I
think anybody can beat anybody," said
Streeter. "There's even more incentive
to win the championship because of the
automatic bid. It will make the confer
ence race that much more exciting."

The Bullets' 107th season kicks
off this Saturday at home against
Randolph-Macon.

Volleyball
Head Coach: Kim Kelly, 4th season
Last Year's Record: 31-9, Centennial
Conference Champions, lost in third
round of the NCAA tournament.
Key players lost: Knstie Deickman
(OH); Jessica Bode (DS).
Key returning players: Catherine Schott
(OH), senior; Nicole Evans (S), junior;
Lisa Kamin (MH), junior; Mary Guay
(DS), junior; Megan Wargo (OH),
sophomore; Jenna McKinsey (OH/DS),
senior.
Key Newcomers: Jessica Wininger (DS/
OH); Lauren Boyd (S).
Outlook: The Lady Bullets will look to
continue their dominance this season as
they aim to capture a sixth consecutive
conference championship.

The women return six starters
from a team that reached the third
round of the NCAA tournament, in
cluding AU-Amencan and two time CC
Player of the Year, Catherine Schott.
The senior hitter led the confer
ence in hitting percentage (45.2) and
kills per game (4.74).
Schott will be "set" up by junior
Nicole Evans, who led the conference
last season with 12.58 assists per game.
Junior Lisa Kamin was a second team
all-conference selection.
"We want to remain on top of the

Recycling rampage

By Cara mamjcci
Staff Writer
If you desire to be envi
ronmentally conscious and re
cycle but don't have the foggi
est notion as to how, then
you're in
luck. _Tliis

past spring
and sum
mer, the
College,
with the
help of ad
ministra-tors, fac
ulty mem
bers, staff
and stu
dents put
together a
task force
to make
recycling a
primary focus for
t h e
Gettysburg College

c o m m u -
nity. " R_^g ht
now we recycle at a rate of 8
12% - we hope that we can
raise that number to 25% over
the next few years," said Emily
Celano, the Recycling task
force intern. This push to re
cycle has been fueled not only
by concerned groups on cam
pus like Gettysburg Environ
mental Concerns Organization
(GECO) but also by Pennsylva
nia, which holds a 25% recy¬

cling rate as a goal state wide.
The school itself has be
come much more conservative
in energy use over the last
couple of years, according to
Celano. "The College has sen
sor lights in many of the public
bathrooms on campus to con¬

serve electricity, and many of
the bathrooms also have high
pressure toilets to conserve
water," she said. The school has
also looked into composting a
few years down the road and
the possibility of hauling the
school's own trash to help
work toward the goal of being
environmentally conscience.
Before this year, there
were recycling containers in

some buildings, but they were
few and tar between. "We are
trying to be much more con
sistent with recycling this
year," said Celano. Each
building on campus will have
recycling containers this year,
including added containers in

photo by Steve Spicer

big buildings like the CUB and
Penn Hall. There will also be
containers outside of the li
brary and outside of the Bul
let Hole. "Every person who
has a desk on campus will get
their own green recycling con
tainer as well," said Celano.
"Students on campus will also
get a green recycling basket
for papers as well as a white
bin for cans, etc."

What can be recycled will
also change this year. While the
campus will still be able to re
cycle aluminum, plastic and
glass bottles, tlje list of recy
clable material now includes tin
can;,, several types of toner car
tridges, batteries and phone
books. In the past,
aluminum, plastic
and glass containers
had separate bins;
now they fall under
"commingled" cat
egory with tin cans,
and will be able to

goals and benefits of recycling
more on campus. "If more
people were aware of the recy
cling program, then it would
make a huge difference," said
Celano. Celano also created a
website this summer - https-.//
cnav.www.gettysburg.edu/
~s378612/Recychng.html
Celano won a scholarship
to go to the national conference
this September sponsored by
the National Softdnnk Associa
tion and College and Univer
sity Recycling Council. Celano
wrote an essay explaining what
she did over the summer and
why she wanted to go to the
conference. She hopes to bring
back even more ideas on how
to boost awareness about recy
cling.

"For recycling on the
Gettysburg campus to increase,
it ib going to take the initiative
of everyone involved," said
Celano. "From the facilities ser
vices department, to GECO, to
the RA's and RC's to the mem
bers of the campus, we all need
to pitch in to work at the goal
of recycling."

be recycled in one
bin. The school is
also allowing for
the recychn'g of not
only white paper,
but newspaper and
colored paper as
well. Students can
still recycle card
board packing
boxes in their resi
dence hall trash
rooms.
Celano would
like to visit first
year health and
wellness classrooms
to talk about the

David Potts to address campus

From GCPR
David Potts, Gettysburg
College's academic dean from
1979 to 1986, will deliver a
talk that will be the final event
in the celebration of the 200th
birthday of Samuel S.
Schmucker, founder of the Col
lege and the Lutheran Theo
logical Seminary at Gettysburg.
Potts will discuss "Founders
and Founding: Gettysburg in
the Defining Years for Ameri
can Colleges and Culture" at
11:30 a.m., September 23, in
the Gettysburg College Union
Building Ballroom. His presen
tation, which will be followed
by a complimentary lunch, is
open to the public free of
charge.
Potts began his career as

an assistant professor of history
at Union College, where he also
served as director of the Under
graduate Program in American
Studies and associate dean of
faculty. He came to Gettysburg
in 1979 and served as dean of
the college until 1986, when he
was appointed scholar-in-resi
dence at Wesleyan University.
He then served as a professor
of history and academic vice
president and dean of the uni
versity at the University of
Puget Sound.
Potts has written a num
ber of articles and several
books, including "Wesleyan
University, 1831-1910: Colle
giate Education in New En
gland." In addition, he has
served as trustee of Union Col
lege, president of Alpha of New

York Chapter of Phi Betta
Kappa, a member of the edito
rial board of the "History of
Higher Education Annual" and
speaker and faculty member of
the American Council on Edu
cation Leadership Develop
ment Program.
"Legacy of Leadership,"
a series of events to commemo
rate the 200th birthday of
Samuel S. Schmucker and rec
ognize his influence on educa
tion, religion and community
in Gettysburg and beyond, was
sponsored by Gettysburg Col
lege, the Lutheran Historical
Society, the Lutheran Theologi
cal Seminary at Gettysburg,
Music, Gettysburg!, and the St.
John Evangelical Lutheran
Church in Hagerstown, MD.
The project was also supported

in part by the Pennsylvania
Humanities Council, the Fed
eral State Partner of the Na
tional Endowment for the Hu
manities.

Student influx
- continued from page 1 -
and more students enrolled.
"It's almost 'guesstimat
ing' and this year was just one
of those years with
abberations," said Ramsey.
Dean Ramsey also pointed out
that the new faculty and
courses are just to improve the
college academically, not to
accomadate the 60 more stu
dents in this year's class than
last year's.
Sections of courses had to
be added like English compo
sition and Wellness Lifestyles.
A new science building that will
be located behind Master's
Hall will house the chemistry
department, leaving
Bnedenbaugh's future use up
for discussion.

"It (Gettysburg) is a very
attractive, exciting place for
students. We have strong fac
ulty, and an excellent location.
We are technically quite ad
vanced and we're doing a lot
of good things that seem to be
attracting students," said
Ramsey.
As the trends for m
cieased enrollment seem like
they will continue for the up
coming years, Gettysburg re
mains focused on the challeng
ing academic and up close and
personal atmosphere it has es
tablished itself with interna
tionally. The College, accord
ing to Ramsey has a strategic
plan outlining the College's fu
ture and long-term goals.
"There are a lot of pro
grams and things we are look
ing to do here, but are simply
waiting for the funds to pro
ceed," said Ramsey.

As the College may be
waiting for funding for some
long-term projects, many po
tential students will be waiting
for a chance when they can at
tend one of the nation's best
colleges. Our college, despite
increased applicants and enroll
ment, will remain dedicated to
the providing one of the best
academic opportunities avail
able and will be ready for new
situations.

Semester at Sea announces
summer 2000 program

From GCPR
In June of 2000 the Insti
tute for Shipboard Fducation

C.B. Rogers donates $1 million for technology

From GCPR
When C. B. "Jack"
Rogers attended Gettysburg
College nearly 50 years ago, the
words "technology" and "com
puters" didn't appear in a single
course description. Rogers'
recent $1 million gift insures
that his alma mater continues
to integrate technology into the
classroom far into the next cen
tury. Rogers went from his
humble "no-tech" student days
to a distinguished and lengthy
business career with two glo
bal technology firms, Interna¬

tional Business Machines
(IBM) and, currently, Equifax,
one of the world's largest in
formation management and
transaction processing services.
A resident of Atlanta,
Georgia, Rogers is past presi
dent, chief executive officer
and chairman of Equifax, and
now serves as chair of the ex
ecutive committee of the
company's board of directors.
Rogers' $1 million gift
will establish the Rogers Cen
ter for Innovation in Technol
ogy at Gettysburg College. The
new center will serve as an en
dowment and will provide con¬

tinued resources to incorporate
technology into academic and
extracurricular programs. The
gift will also be the basis for a
challenge to his 1951 class
mates as they prepare for their
50th reunion in 2001.
Rogers has challenged his
classmates to contribute $3
million in additional gifts and
pledges to the College during
the next two years. The po
tential resulting reunion gift of
at least $4 million will surpass
any single gift in the College's
history.
"Having spent a lifetime
in the field of computers, I
know firsthand how important
it is for an institution to stay
current with the development
of new technologies," Rogers
said. "Gettysburg College can
not afford to slip in its position
of leadership in the use of tech
nology in the classroom if it is
to maintain its status as one of
the nation's top liberal arts col
leges."

This spring, the College
placed eighth in a list of the
country's "most wired cam
puses" complied by "Yahoo!
Internet Life" magazine. The
campus computer network has
also been identified as one of
the best in the country by

CAUSE, a national consortium
of higher education informa
tion technology leaders.
"Right now," said Mike
Martys, Vice Provost for infor
mation resources and comput
ing at Gettysburg, "many of our
efforts in applying technology
in our courses is akin to redeco
rating a house. With Rogers'
gift, faculty will be able to pur
sue substantial technology
driven changes in their courses.
In other words, faculty will
now be able to make major
"home improvements.'"
Among the future initia
tives Martys envisions is the

development of at least one
"smart" classroom, ideally lo
cated in a proposed Center for
Teaching, Learning and Advis
ing. The classroom will be used
as an area where faculty can
experiment with the latest in
technology to enhance their
courses.
Martys anticipates that
additional cutting edge class
room tools like three-dimen
sional visualization, virtual re
ality, robotic camera and real
time two-way
videoconferencing will also
become available to faculty
members as part of the Rogers

Center.
"The College is truly for
tunate to have an alumnus like
Jack Rogers, who is a pioneer
in the management and mar
keting of two of the largest glo
bal technology firms," said
Gettysburg College President
Gordon Haaland. "His finan
cial commitment and leader
ship in securing additional sup
port will also allow the College
to plan for the long-term future
of current programs and design
new efforts to integrate tech
nology as a component in
Gettysburg's tradition of teach
ing and learning."

Speaker to examine hate groups

From GCPR
Ann M. Van Dyke, staff
member of the Pennsylvania
Human Relations Commission
(PHRC) responsible for moni
toring organized hate group
activity in the Commonwealth,
will present a free public lec
ture titled "The State of Hate
in Pennsylvania...And the Good
News." The lecture will be held
at 7 p.m., on Tuesday, Septem
ber 21, in room 260 of the
College Union Building at

Gettysburg College.
The Pennsylvania Human
Relations Commission has
documented 49 separate white
supremacist groups active in 35
counties in the past two years.
In February, Gettysburg Col
lege held several public dem
onstrations in support of diver
sity after a national hate group,
The World Church of the Cre
ator, threatened to pass out lit
erature at all Pennsylvania col
leges and universities.
In her presentation, Van
Dyke will discuss reasons why
hate group membership in
Pennsylvania is on the rise, the
groups' primary recruitment
methods, strategies that com
munities have successfully used
to combat hate groups and cur¬

rent laws regarding public dem
onstrations by these groups.
Van Dyke is the assistant
to the director of education and
community services at the
PHRC. For the past 10 years,
she has provided technical as
sistance to employers, munici
palities, educational institu
tions, religious groups and con
cerned citizens regarding hate
group activities. She is certi
fied by the U.S. Department of
Justice to conduct hate group
training for police.
Van Dyke's expertise in
the subject has been sought by
major national media, includ
ing 20/20, National Public Ra
dio, A&E Investigative Report,
The Washington Post and The
New York Times.

Murders, rock, and comedy:

by Gina Dell Uomo
Staff Writer
Believe it or not, southern Penn
sylvania does not quite rank up there
with New York or Los Angeles as one
of the nation's entertainment meccas.
However, this fall Gettysburg College

may be the exception to
that rule. One of the pri
mary functions of orga
nizations like the Stu
dent Activities Council
(SAC), the Office of Stu
dent Activities (OSA),
and the College Union
(CU) is to provide enter
tainment and program¬

ming for the campus
community. This fall,
these organizations,
along with several oth
ers, have planned many
different activities of all
kinds for the student
body to attend. Tradi
tional events like the fall
concert, Homecoming
and Parents Weekend
activities, and noon con
certs will be joined this
year by all-new attrac
tions such as a Murder
Mystery night and a
Crabfest.
The Murder Mys
tery night, sponsored by
SAC, will be held on Sat
urday November 5th in
the new student dining
area of Servo. Tickets

Angry Salad will be returning to Gettysburg to perform at the September 18 all-campus party

will be required to at-
tend, but will not cost
anything. They simply allow organiz
ers to limit the number of people at
tending, so that the whole audience can
participate in the action and get the full
experience of the

Gettysburg's Fall 99 Season

Murder Mystery.
The show will be
gin with a murder
taking place, and

for the rest of the
time, it is the
audience's job to solve the crime and
find the killer.
Krista Gehringer, chairperson of
SAC's entertainment committee, said,
"The crabfest is also a new idea that

Gettysburg is the fall concert on Satur
day, October 30 at 9 o'clock in the CUB
Ballroom. The act has yet to be an
nounced. Some examples of past acts
are Ziggy Marley and Rusted Root.

tions have ongoing entertainment hap
penings. There are often noon concerts
on Wednesdays in the Junction, spon
sored by the OSA/CU, as well as fea
tured speakers on Tuesdays, also at noon

night at 10 in the CUB Ballroom.
Gehringer explained, "This is just our
way to provide more entertainment for
students and to keep up with what the
student body wants."

should be a lot of fun; it is being spon
sored by SAC, Student Senate, the
Panhellenic Council, and the Interfra
ternity Council (IFC)." The crab feast
takes place on Saturday, September 25
at 5:30 next to specialty dining, and
features a Caribbean theme with music
by the Wizdom Reggae Band.
Not to be forgotten, many of the

traditional oppoi tunities for enteitain
ment continue to seive as unifying ac
tivities for the campus. Foi instance,
one of the _biggest events this fall at

Homecoming Weekend, which
brings together alumni, faculty, and cur
rent students alike, will be an entire
weekend of activities with plenty of
quality entertainment. The highlight of
the weekend will be a performance by
the innovative and upbeat group, Max
Creek, on the night of Saturday, Octo
ber 2. The event will be BYOB and held

outside on Stme Lake "undei the tiki
lamps."
In addition to special events like
these, many dilterent student oiganiza-

ln the Junction, sponsored by the
Gettysburg Environmental Concerns
Organization (GECO). To further pro
mote one of their most important
causes, encouraging recycling to con
serve resources, GECO is co-sponsor
ing a benefit concert with SAC featur
ing Woodstock legend Richie Havens.
He will perform on Saturday, October
1 _£ _af 1 0 in the Rallrnnm_.

Another ongoing
goal that organizations
like SAC have always
focused on is providing
the types of entertain
ment that Gettysburg
students want to be of¬

fered. "SAC has always
provided quality enter
tainment for the cam
pus and has kept up
with changing trends of
entertainment," stated
Gehringer, "We are lis
tening to what the col
lege students ask for
however, and that in
cludes late night pro
grams and more BYOB.
So, we are doing more
BYOB at events and
when it is possible we
have the beer/wine pro
vided by us."

The all-campus
paity, just one of the
upcoming events which
will be considered
BYOB, is scheduled for
Saturday, September 18
I t .1 -r
at nt in tne

micinigjunc
tion. The party will fea
ture the group Angry
Salad. Beer and wine will be provided
by SAC when they sponsor a Comedy
Club with comedians Alonzo Budden
and Tina Giorgi perfoimmg tomorrow

REVIEWS
sense Guide not for all

Willis. Osment terrify in

by Jody Robertson
Contributing Reviewer
What was with that red
doorknob, anyway?
To those who haven't
seen The Sixth Sense, starring
Bruce Willis and Haley Joel
Osment, this question is pretty

much meaningless. For those of arms are cov
us who have seen it, though, it's e r e d _^m k
been lurking in the backs of our _^_£ _^m _^
minds, popping up at ran- _^^ _^ m J_^_F
dom times to drive us _^ _^m _^m
crazy. _^ _^ # _J _^
The Sixth Sense isn't _^m ^^
your average summer 7 <^^^ >^^^ ~^_a_^

popcorn action flick. It
has smarts, style, mood,
and Bruce Willis in a dap
per coat. (Okay, so we all
have our own reasons for

watching it.) Other pluses
include the terrific child
actor Osment as Cole
Sear, our emotional focus
throughout the movie, a
heartfelt performance by Tom
Collette (seen in the recent re
make of Emma) as his single,
two-job-working mother, and
subtle acting by Olivia Williams
as the wife of Dr. Malcolm
Crowe, the latter played sin
cerely by Bruce Willis.
For the uninitiated, The
Sixth Sense is the story of a
gifted child psychologist, Dr.
Crowe (who has the expensive
frame to prove it), who is con
fronted in his home at the be
ginning of the movie by a
former patient of his, now

grown up into a severely un
balanced man. Some time later,
the doctor is still exhibiting
self-doubt and questioning his
own ability to help children.
His newest case, young Cole
Sears, is withdrawn and dis
trustful, hiding in churches,
and huddling in a makeshift
tent in his room. His

with scratches which may or
may not be self-inflicted or a
form of child-abuse, and he has
a tendency to clam up and say
that no one can help him.
Frustrated, and afraid of
failure, Dr. Crowe spends more
and more time researching his
patient's symptoms and speak
ing with the troubled youth,
and as a consequence grows
farther away from his wife,
who, he suspects, may be seek
ing comfort in the arms of one
of her coworkers. It is only
when he breaks the news to

Cole that he has to stop coun
seling him, due to circum
stances in his own life, that the
boy finally confides what's
been 'haunting' him: "I see
dead people." But don't be
fooled, lest you think the movie
goes downhill from there. Met
with disbelief and
patronization from all sides,
Cole's nightmare isn't going
to be solved as simply as that.
There are lots of won
derful moments in the movie,
and far be it from me to give
them away in too blatant

terms. It's got its share of
scares, for one thing. Those
who have seen the film will
understand the jolt I refer to
when I mention the kid with
his fathei 's gun, or the bicy
clist by the window. But un
like recent films such as The
Haunting, special effects
aren't used to manipulate
feai. It's rather a masterful
blend of suspense and mys
tery that keeps the audience
perched on the edges of their
seats, and keeps the tension
going throughout.

And yes, you've all heard
that there's a trick ending. Do
yourself a favor if you've yet to
see the movie, and don't let a
spoilsport clue you in before
you see it. It's much more deli
cious to try to puzzle it out on
your own. And do yourself an
even bigger favor, and see it
before it leaves town! It's defi
nitely a movie to remember. I
give it four out of five stars.

Class of '99
Most college and gradu
ate school guides are index-like
references filled with terse de
scriptions of majors and
schools. Guidebooks such as
Peterson's Graduate Programs
serve as dictionaries character
izing each school with a super
ficial, page-long explanation.
However, the editors of Lingua
Franca, the academic magazine,
have created The Real Guide to
Giad School: What You Better
Know Before You Choose, an
etiological narrative for each
potential field of graduate

study. A
t h o u g
The Real
G it i d e
t o ,
Giad i
Scbml M
was «

clearly written for doctoral
candidates in the humanities
and social sciences, it provides
general descriptive information
about the differences between
undergraduate and graduate
study. The lengthy introduc
tion reveals the somber atmo
sphere that envelopes graduate
students with warnings of the
pressure to professionalize.
"Profs will just assume you are
reading all the latest books and
journals and are well versed in
a field's core works, regardless
of your new standing."
The introductory chapter
discusses admissions, accumu
lating the advice of current
university faculty members
who advise students to focus on
specific faculty research inter
ests within the department of
interest. Chapters on Finances
and The Rise of the Research
Scholar also teeter between
useful information and verbos
ity.

Twenty-three separate
disciplines are examined in the
second section of the book.
Each chapter contains an his¬

torical overview of the study of
che particular area; in the case
of Chapter 21: Communica
tion, for example, the informa
tion begins with a discussion of
Greek rhetoric and Walter
Lippman. Each chapter begins
with narrative paragraphs
about current graduate stu
dents; Travis Dixon of U.C.
Santa Barbara and Carolyn
Brownstein of the University of
Wisconsin are highlighted as
communication scholars. The
four main theoretical perspec
tives of media studies are dis
cussed with examples of cur
rent research in each area.
However, the listing of specific
universities and programs is
_^ \ condensed
/ \ in four

para
graphs con¬

taining five or six names of' ex
cellent schools or professors"
within each theoretical per
spective. The schools are
named at the end of the chap
ter without commentary or
critical analysis. Faculty testi
monials as well as discussion of
academic and industry jobs
constitute the job market analy
sis that wraps up the chapter.
Perhaps The Real Guide
to Grad School should be re
titled "An Introduction to
Graduate Study" because of its
textbook like subheadings and

prolix descriptions. Still, as a
graduate school guide, it is
clearly distinct from the stan
dard references, and it provides
useful, unique, source specific
information. Students who re
quire a broader perspective on
their field of interest or want
an honest impression of gradu
ate school should read this
book immediately. Masters
degree seekers and less recent
college graduates, however,
will find themselves alienated
from the primary audience this
book addresses.

Libby is sorry to hear that

How to spot a first year

by Kris fine Meier
Staff Writer
Well freshmen, our first
week of classes lias come and
gone, and it's official that we
are in college (and out of high
school.)
What have we learned so
far? I know for myself, there
are some important items that
have come to my attention.
First, I have learned ex
actly what a "freshman tag"
is. It is what most of us carry
our keys on and how the up
perclassmen know who we are.
Just as we come to college to
try and start anew with our own
individuality, people can still
identify us with something as
simple as a keychain.

Speaking of labels,
weren't we told that word trav
els fast? The upperclassmen
weren't joking! I have already
heard about "the pimps" and
"party girls". Geez!

OK, now CNAV From
the moment we made contact
with Gettysburg to the present
we keep hearing about how
Gettysburg is the 8th most
wired campus. The only thing
that has been wired is me

try- ^^^^^^^_"_^ ing
to figure it out. And
they say technology is supposed
to make our lives easier.
Now, I don't know about
the rest ot my class, but I
thought I would have tons of
free time to both study and
socialize in college. Wrong!

I've been on my toes since I got
here to try and figure out what
they call "time management".
What time?!
One thing that was
brought to my attention today
by Meredith Batron, another
freshman, was that if you don't
have a pair of khakis, go out
and buy some! Jeans aren't
dominant here.
However, in a tone of
seriousness, I have realized
I all of the opportunities here
at the Burg. It is a place that
many of the class of 2003, in
cluding myself, have already
been calling "home".
Finally, the last thing I
have found out is to stop ask
ing questions on what the so
cial scene is like, how hard col
lege classes are, and what cam
pus life is like in general. We'll
always get different answers.

These are things that we,
the class of 2003, will have to
answer for ourselves...and we
have four great years to do it.

Young Man Lincoln: _sps

by gabor boritt
Director of Civil War
Institute
We think we know him.
But what do we really know,
especially about the private
man whom we all suspect to be
somehow crucially tied to the
public one? "Historians are

forever doomed to
ignorance about the
early life of
Abraham Lincoln,"
began The Last Best
Hope of Earth

summed up more than 20 years
of learning about Lincoln by
the Pulitzer Prize-winning his

Honor's Voice, a solid new por
trait of the private Lincoln be
tween the ages of 22 and 33,
during the years 1831-42, ~
that puts him in a strikingly X
fresh light.
The book starts not
from the President's legend
ary greatness but from his

actual beginnings. Wilson, the
Saunders Director of the Inter
national Center for Jefferson
Studies at Monticello, focuses
with careful intensity on oth
erwise antiquarian oral remi
niscences that help illuminate
Lincoln's rise. Wilson tells a
story about a search for iden
tity and self-definition, and fol
lows Lincoln's very exacting
road of self-education, his find
ing of a vocation in law and
politics, and the partial resolu
tion of his painfully difficult
relations with women.

The evolution of his reli
gious outlook might illustrate
his education. Raised a Bap
tist, Lincoln never outgrew a
sense of fatalism, even " a
nameless sense of ...doom."
But he had the strength to go
against the grain, and he
quickly found the skeptics. He
read in Thomas Paine about "a
young woman engaged to be
married and while under this
engagement she is, to speak
plain language, debauched by
a ghost": It is the story of the
Virgin Mary.
The law student, while
teaching himself the rules of
evidence, wrote two manu
scripts of religious skepticism,
long lost but also long remem
bered by his contemporaries.
According to John T. Stuart, his
first law partner, Lincoln "went

l
Flatboatman, hog driver, blashphemer, and
whoremonger transforms himself 1 f

the words were not honest, and
relied on smear and innuendo.
Yet Lincoln carried a "compul
sion" to help the helpless, and
learned, to quote the
Shakespeare he had come to
love, that the best of men " have
pow'r to hurt and will do

none. His most troublesome
problem was women. The
young man who had lost his
mother at the age of 9 always
felt awkward around them -
except for older women. He
loved Ann Rutledge, she died
and he fell apart. Friends and,
in time, work helped Lincoln
back from a perhaps suicidal
mental breakdown. The
depth of his grief suggests
to Wilson that Ann's
death challenged the core y
of his being. His central _'

goal in life, his wish to
rise, "to shape and even to con
trol events," now seemed
"nothing but foolish vanity."
Ambivalence character
ized his later courtships and
various marriage proposals. A
possible reason for this, at least
for a period of time, may have
been a fear of syphilis, not an
unknown disease in his world.
Wilson does not credit stories
of Lincoln's possible love chil
dren but notes two episodes
with prostitutes. If once or
twice, why not more often?

ten by another woman, but
Mary did not let go. As his
brother-in-law put it, "Lincoln
in his conflicts of duty-honor
and his love went as crazy as a
Loon." In time he recovered
the ability to rule him¬
self, _^^^^^^ strength
d ^^^^^ en ing
m_^ m ins

/ / self-re¬
spect by getting
married. Love, Wilson sug
gests, seems to have had "very
little to do with it."
Lincoln's road, therefore,
was both harder and
"swampier" than legend or
scholars have allowed: the dif
ficulties and temptations wider,
the fears and depressions
deeper. By 34 he appeared to
have overcome his troubles, but
not many signs of future great
ness had yet turned up.
After 130-some years of
Lincoln appraisals, how can a

Herndon himself—the person
who knew Lincoln better than
anyone but Mary Todd. His
torians have long used these
oft-conflicting, difficult-to-read
manuscripts, but Wilson's fa
miliarity with them is unsur
passed.
The bulk of the reminis
cences collected by Herndon
were from 1865-66 and, as
Wilson explains, emphasize the
"honorable, or at least unobjec
tionable." But "Honor's
voice," as Wilson calls them,
"can tell us a great deal, and
sometimes tells us much more
than it intended."
This book establishes
Wilson as the leading historian

of the young and private Lin
coln. Still, others sifting
through the same sources may
reach somewhat different con
clusions, or take matters fur
ther. Consider the story about
Lincoln's visiting a prostitute
and after undressing, realizing
that he is $2 short of the
needed $5 fee. He is offered
credit but he departs, leaving
the woman astonished at his
integrity. Wilson knows that
this sounds like "a deliberate
parody of the Honest Abe Lin
coln legend," yet he accepts it.
But might not a less cautious
biographer venture an addi
tional step, teasing out of this
story and other evidence the

further against Christian beliefs
.. .than any man I ever heard."
As he advanced in politics, Lin
coln muted his heathenish talk,
but even during this early pe
riod he learned to present him
self, when necessary, "as an
unfortunate victim of unbe
lief." A hypocrite? Wilson's
readers can decide, but Lincoln
was certainly someone with a

His longtime law partner, Wil
liam Herndon, thought that
"Lincoln had a strong if not a
terrible passion for women: he
could hardly keep his hands
off." Nor would he get married
until he was 33.
As Lincoln the outsider
learned to be an insider, deep
anxieties beset him about his
ability to make a living, about

scholar, especially one as ex
traordinarily careful and fair as
Wilson, create a startlingly new
Lincoln? Wilson's achievement
stems in part from the respect
the culture has acquired for
oral history (which often gives
voice to the voiceless) and from
his having put together, with
his colleague Rodney O. Davis,
the Szold Professor of History

sense of self-preservation. And
someone at this time a very
long way from the Second In
augural.
In politics and law Lin
coln rose from successful fron
tier fighter to peacemaker who
fought with words. At times

success in law, about polite so
ciety. His journey led him from
country to village to town,
where he found the exciting,
highborn Mary Todd. A super
ficial courtship was followed by
a commitment to marry. In a
brief diversion, he became smit-

re of about 250
people who knew Lincoln:
Herndon's _htformants: Letters,
Interviews, and Statements
About Abraham Lincoln
(1998). The two men have also
been assembling, but have not
yet published, the similarly
massive recollections of

possibility of a homosexual
young man, even if observers
and participants failed to speak
of such?
Focusing on the private
Lincoln while mostly ignoring
th_; public one can obscuie the
private, too. For example, to
prevent a quorum at a session
of the Illinois State Legislature
in 1840, Representative Lin
coln jumped out a window of
the building where the mem
bers were meeting. Wilson sees
this as a sign of private distress.
That the leap was intended to
influence important financial
legislation during a debilitating
economic depression is largely
lost. Biographers, then, will
have to use Honor's Voice with
both admiration and a critical
eye.

It is profitable to divide
the Lincoln literature roughly
into two schools: "Lincoln
the man" and "Lincoln the
god." Both have their uses.
Wilson's book, with its un
derstated even prose, falls
plainly into the first camp,
and it makes a fine coun
terpoint to Garry Wills's Lin
coln at Gettysburg with its por
trait of a President who "re
made America" with a brief
speech. Had Wilson claimed
to be showing all of Lincoln,
he might be criticized for miss
ing some of the elements that
make his subject great. As it is,
he makes a very important start
toward a new understanding of
the greatest of Americans.
Writing about Lincoln is
not something to be brushed

off as simply a scholarly exer
cise. In our multicultural age
he remains a man of world
historic significance, the very
symbol of what is best about
the United States. During the
Iranian revolution, a reporter
saw a big painted slogan in Te
heran: "Government of the
people, by the people, for the
people." During Jiang Zemin's
recent visit to the United States,
the Chinese president conjured
up Lincoln's memory. So has
Pope John Paul II. When Colin
Powell announced his refusal to
run for the Presidency, he held
up but one name. The Lincoln
scholar's responsibilities are
large. Honor's Voice gives
Americans reason to be grate
ful that the field continues to
attract students of ability and

integrity.

Consider This....

Perhaps the biggest single problem facing an expanding college
is housing. A residential college such as Gettysburg needs to make
sure it has enough housing as it continues to expand. The new Quarry
Suites will house about 160 students, but in the past few years, the
total college enrollment has grown by almost that amount.
The college's current practice of buying every motel in sight can
not continue. While some facilities like Criterion are quite acceptable
for student living, the distant Aberly Hall and spartan Appleford Inn
are not up to par with other campus buildings. In the case of the Semi-

room for new facilities.
Spatial considerations aside, Gettysburg should not want to in
crease class size beyond its present numbers. People come here for
the friendly atmosphere and personal attention, not to become a num
ber. A small increase in student population is beneficial, but expan
sion for its own sake is unecessary and superficial.

nary, having students located so far away from
campus detracts from the sense of close-knit
community that Gettysburg strives to offer.
Commuting students and sprawling campuses
are common to large universities where stu
dents primarily remain anonymous. A small lib
eral school needs to keep its enrollment down,
or else find ways to keep all of its students
housed on campus.
The College promised students4iving in
the recently acquired Appleford Inn that their
rooms would have phones, network access
and air conditioning upon arrival in August. The
rooms still lack phones and network capabil
ity. The College should not find itself in these
situations. There must be a way to keep the
enrollment limited to the number of beds avail
able. The new Quarry Suites look promising,
but if the College grows at the present rate,
they will still not be enough. Within ten years
the college could own every building north of
the square!
There are benefits to increased enroll¬

ment, but a limit has to be set. A school like
Gettysburg College cannot keep expanding.
There is simply not enough space in this town
to accommodate an ever-growing student
population. A maximum of 2,500 students
seems likely, unless the College plans to tear
down major sections of town in order to make

I'll sit around, nowhere special,
and wonder about things. It happens
more and more frequently lately, usu
ally while staring out the window at the
tree, but sometimes during a lecture or
waiting in line for food. Nothing fixed,
sometimes casual thoughts about why
my mp3 player keeps skipping or what
the weather is at the beach, little stuff
really.

I often won
der about fate. Not
the"ooh, what if I'd

bits of fate, but the
little realities of
fate, the day-to-day
things. It's been
tossing me
curveballs lately, but
I wonder if things
are going the right
way for a reason.
After awhile,
you learn to stop
trying and let things
happen. And if you

enjoy
the ride, because there's nothing you
can do to stop it from coming up and
kicking you in the butt.
This place is growing on me, I
think. The nasty muggy days can give
way to any type of cool weather any
time they want, but aside from that —
and the cleaning crew coming at the
crack of dawn — I'm getting to like this
joint. The people are rather friendly,
and the food is good, and the atmo
sphere is downright inviting. We've got
a quality grounds _keeping staff, too. I

appreciate the well-kept lawns.
I must admit, somewhat disap
pointedly so, that my lack of sleep is
finding ways to catch up to me. Noth
ing a good pot of coffee won't fix
though. The folks around here really
appreciate my high spirits I'm sure, es
pecially at eight-thirty in the morning.
My ghost has apparently left for
greener pastures, too. I hope the men
tion of him won't entice him to make
an encore presentation, I can live with
out the noises in the middle of the night.
Every¬

not sure
about some
things. It's
going to be a
long, long

things are go

wonder when
and what
things will

All things, nothing specific, some
times we'd like to forego the pleasure
of surprise and just have the Cliff's
notes or something. What's meant to
be and what's not? That's for no one
to know and everyone to find out, I sup
pose. But they say that good things
come to those who wait. So what do
you do? Just sit back and wait, wait for
the little hand of fate to push things into
the right pattern, and live until the
alarm goes off telling you it is all ready

BY LA. LsHERWOOD
Social Commentator
Once again, as the bril
liant heat of summer is cooled
by the gentle winds of autumn,
Gettysburg is alive with the ea
ger presence of us, the students
of this fine institution. After
spending my second summer
here, I have noticed a definite
change in the pre-student and
post-student local environ
ment. The obvious difference
is that in the summer, local
haunts are less crowded, the
campus is barren, and
things tend to be a bit _• 9
cleaner and a little more
peaceful when the students
are not around.
Being around locals (or

"towmes," as students tend to
call them) extensively, I have
noticed firsthand the type of
prejudice and preconceived
notions that are present in our
neighbors in the south of town.
We are made out to be
drunken, lawless spoiled brats
in some cases, or indifferent
and snobbish in others. I have
heard stories about vandalism,
violent fights, and wanton dis
regard for private property.
Now, I understand that some
of these occurrences might be
inflated, or that such events are
inevitable, but I can confess to
you I actually have felt embar
rassed to say that I go to the
College. Why is this? I shall
elaborate.

For the site of my case
study, I will use a local institu
tion known simply as The Pub,
a place where upperclassmen
go for nights of social interac
tion. Well, that is putting it a
little too formally: The Pub,
where a good majority of up
perclassmen go to become in
coherently drunk, listen to lots
of Billy Joel, and to have their
drinks spilled as people "acci
dentally" knock over chairs
and tables.
I must confess that this
pub is quite a different place in

the summer, meanirtg it is
mostly peaceful and relaxed.
When the last week of August
rolls around, however, it as
sumes the same cheap meat
market look of the previous
May, and the tranquihty is
abruptly ended when the first
person vomits on the floor. Is
this type of behavior really nec
essary, or am I missing the hu
mor in the whole public vom
iting thing? It is not just the
floors of the Pub which have

a n MilHlnuJ/
soiled, X|^^^^^^^
but the stairwell, of course the
bathrooms, and countless num
bers of pitchers, which, after
the owner empties them of
cheap beer, he or she decides
to refill with something else.
I have been to The Pub
several times over the past few
weeks doing research for this
column, and to meet old
friends for a few drinks. I have
witnessed not only the above
mentioned incidents, but a level
of rudeness and arrogance to
ward the bar staff which is in
tolerable.

Drunken people trying to
fill their glasses off the taps is
one example. People trying to
carry bottles outside is another.
Running up a very large tab on
a credit card and then stiffing
the waitress of bartender is one
of the most immature things a
person can do, and to what
end? So that we all become
linked to the stereotype that
college students are rude,
spoiled, inconsiderate and self
ish? From the things I have
seen, I can say that many actu
ally are - and many of those
who don't commit the actual

deed will encourage their silly
friends by laughing or by ha
rassing the bartender for more
drinks. Just the other night
there were paper towels and
toilet paper thrown across the
bathrooms for no real reason.
Did it ever occur to any
one that someone has to clean
up every scrap of paper, bit of
broken glass, cigarette butt, and
puddle of vomit left behind by
the tidal wave of students as
saulting the bar for cheap pitch
ers? How much of a moron
do you have to be to act like
that? People complain

about poor
_^. service,
_^_T w h'ich is far
^^^ from the
^^^^truth, but
how would
any of you like to
up someone else's

clean

mess all of the time? Yet most
students take this for granted,
and even worse, many ignore
the issue completely and con
tinue being just as obnoxious
as before.
So from examining this
one example, it is easy to de
termine why a good majority
of people in this town have no
respect for college students.
When the upperclassmen, who
are supposed to be wiser than
their under-aged peers, act in
such a way, one does not want
to imagine what the rest of the
college is like. I am not saying
that prejudice and precon
ceived notions are right, but if
I had to deal with the petty van
dalism and noise violations all
the time, I might tend to agree
with them.

The Pub is just one ex
ample which can be made over
for almost any bar in town.
Legally we are all adults, and
those who are 21 and over have
a right to purchase alcohol for
enjoyment. Control is a big
factor and a big responsibility.
Have some tact, and if you
can't control yourself in a pub
lic drinking environment, then
you should not be in one.

Many moral debates have
surfaced in the last decade as a
result of the numerous ad
vancements in the field of sci
ence. The phenomenons we
now know as cloning and ge
netic engineering have made it
possible to create a baby calf
and, as some scientists specu
late, even an infant in a test
tube. The implica
tions that arise
from these

modern
tech
nolo-gies
are far
reach- j
ing
and '
have given
rise to
heated

a r g u - ~—
ments. The con
troversy over the morality be
hind genetically producing liv
ing animals, does not exclude
genetically manipulated food.
Ever since Dolly was cre
ated by genetically cloning a
sheep's embryo at the Roslin
Institute, the possibility of clon
ing animals used for food has
raised many questions. Fur
thermore, genetic cloning has
already been used in enhancing
the "quality" of crops.
The American public still
remains in the dark about how
the food found in our local gro
ceries is actually made.
Wendell Berry describes the
disregard of the American pub
lic towards what comprises
their lunches and dinners in his
1990 essay, "The Pleasures of
Eating,"

The passive American
consumer, sitting down to a
meal of pre-prepared fast food,
confronts a platter covered
with inert, anonymous sub¬

stances_, that have been pro
cessed, dyed, breaded, sauced,
gravied, ground, pulped,
strained, blended, prettified
and sanitized beyond resem
blance to any part of any crea
ture that ever lived.
It is now nine years since
Berry's essay was written, and
most vegetables are now not
only artificially altered but are
genetically altered as well.
About one-third of the
corn produced in the United
States is genetically engineered,
a surprising statistic to
a group of con

Even more surprising is
the fact that corn is not the only
crop that is genetically manipu
lated nowadays. Soy, cotton
and tomatoes join the ranks of
table food mostly created by a
scientist armed with a needle
and chemicals rather than a
farmer with a pitchfork and
shovel.
The EPA encourages food
companies to conduct experi
ments testing the impact of ge
netically produced crops. They
have, however, failed to define
these tests, and companies are
free to conduct experiments on
their own terms.

Al Gore for President: a Democratic mistake?

by John Dunlap
Political Columnist
While it may seem that
George W. Bush and the Re
publican race for the presi
dency is garnering the major
ity of attention in the early
presidential campaigns, the
race on the Democratic side is
not only more competitive, but
a much more interesting early
contest on the road to the
White House. With the public
tired of the Clinton
Administration's embarrass
ments, Democrats are very
afraid of nominating a candi
date for President who has been
arm and arm with Bill Clinton
for eight years.
It was Al Gore who called
one our great
est presidents after he lied to

the nation for almost a year,
and it was Vice President Gore
who sold his soul to Clinton's
reelection in Buddhist Temples.
Al Gore, the self-proclaimed
"inventor of the internet," I am
sure is a very decent man. The
problem with the Vice Presi
dent is that he has had no real
world experience. He was
born in Washington, raised in
Washington, educated in pri
vate schools in the nation's
capital, and has served there
almost his entire life. As a
member of Congress Al Gore
was reasonably moderate and
while being out in left field on
the environment, he did have
a special interest which allowed
him to stand out.
Since teaming up with
President Clinton, Al Gore has
y
President's chief defender, but

allowed himself in 1996 to be
used in one of the most nega
tive campaigns ever run by an
incumbent president. Worse
than campaign tactics,
which are forgivable, _^ 4
was the Vice President _^_Hl
going beyond ethical _^^M
and maybe even legal _^H
boundaries in attempts _^H
to raise funds for the
Clinton/Gore reelection
effort. People are tired of Bill
Clinton and Al Gore, and tiie
Democrats know it. Polls are
showing Texas Governor
George W. Bush easily defeat
ing Gore in a general election
match-up, and even Elizabeth
Dole is ahead of the Vice Presi
dent.

Many Democrats are
turning Senator Bill Bradley. Bradley,

a former Rhodes Scholar and
professional basketball player,
has a deep intellect and a strong
understanding of issues. Like
Al Gore, Bill Bradley could be
_^. called stiff

but his life
long passion
concerning is
sues of race
and urban areas
could inspire the
Democratic left.

advantage
that Bradley has right H
now is that moderates
think lie is moderate and that
liberals think he is liberal. They
both have a point, but what is
more to the point is that the
former New Jersey Senator is
i tinning very close to Gore in
New Hampshire and his
fundraising is not far behind
the incumbent Vice Piesident
of the United States.
Unlike Republicans who
almost always nominate the
hontrunner, a comforting fact
foi Governor Bush, Democrats

do not. Upsets are common m
Democratic contests, George
McGovern upset Ed Muskie in
1972, and who were Jimmy
Carter, Michael Dukakis, and
Bill Clinton before they ran for
President? President Clinton
and his henchman were able to

keep every other
major

Democrat from challenging the
Vice President but they have
done themselves more harm
than good. They have now al
lowed for a one-on-one race
and the opposition to the Vice
President is unified, rather than
splintered.
While the Democratic
field is much smaller than that
of their GOP counterparts, in

Volleyball team 2-2
after busy week

by Kristin Seaks
Staff Writer
The Gettysburg volley
ball team opened their season
on Wednesday, September 1 at
home with a loss to Shepherd
College. Despite jumping out
to a 2-0 lead, Shepherd fought
back to win the match, 3-2.
The competitive match
went to five games, ending with
a 16-14 victory for Shepherd.
Senior captain Catherine
Schott led the Bullets offen
sively with 24 kills while jun
ior Nicole Evans recorded 77
assists. Sophomore Megan
Wargo contributed 22 kills as
well as 27 digs.
On Saturday, Gettysburg
traveled to Shepherd to com
pete in the Ram Rumble Invi
tational. The Ladv Bullets de¬

feated Columbia Union 3-0
with scores of 15-4, 15-8, and
15-5. They went on to capture
another victory against
Kutztown 3-0 (15-6, 159, and
15-10), to place them in the fi
nal round of the tournament
against Shepherd.
Gettysburg won the first
game of the match, 15-12, be
fore the Lady Rams came back
to win the second and third
games with scores of 15-9 and
15-6. The Lady Bullets
bounced back with a victory in
the fourth game, but had a re
peat performance of their sea
son opener against Shepherd in
the fifth game, losing 16-14.
In the championship
match, Schott and Wargo once
again led Gettysburg's offense
with 29 and 16 kills, respec
tively. Evans contributed 61

assists.
Defensively, Wargo had
32 digs and senior Jenna
McKinsey had 16.
"[Shepherd] has a good
team; there's no doubt about
that," said Head Coach Kim
Kelly. "We also know that we
should have beaten them."
Coach Kelly said the '99
Lady Bullets are a young team
with a very strong defense and
the team's juniors and seniors
are doing a great job with lead
ership, helping the team to
"mesh" and come together as
a group.
Evans commented, "In
the past there have been out
standing players to carry us
through. When we are success
ful [this season], the entire team
will carry us through."

Bullets win one, lose one
in opening week

by Chesha Miller
Sports Editor
The Gettysburg men's
soccer team opened their sea
son at home Wednesday with
a 1-0 win over Mary Washing
ton. Junior Jeremy Shapiro
was the star in this one, scor
ing the game's only goal in the
87th minute.
Senior captains Jason
Vishio and Chris Pryor picked
up assists on the winning goal
for the Bullets.
Junior Nick LaPorta
made three saves in goal to
notch his first career victory
and shutout at the collegiate
level. J.T. Nino made five
stops in the net for Mary
Washington (0-1).

Vishio started the win
ning play with a cross from the
right side of the box that Pryor
deflected onto the foot of
Shapiro.

The junior midfielder,
who netted five goals, includ
ing one game-winner last sea
son, one-timed the shot past
Nino to give Gettysburg the

. Shapiro led the Bullets
with three shots on the after
noon while Vishio and senior
Adam Outerbridge added two
apiece.
Saturday's game versus
Shippensburg did not yield
the same results, as the Bul
lets lost 2-0 in non-league ac
tion. "We dominated play,
but just couldn't finish off our
chances," explained Pryor.
Gettysburg outshot the
Red Raiders, 25-6, but were
not able to put a goal behind
Shippensburg keeper Rob
Marchetti.
With the loss, Gettys
burg fell to 1-1, Vishio led the
Bullets with six shots while se
nior captains Jessie Flynn and
Pryor added four shots apiece.

Cress Ccuntry teams shine
in early seascn races

Sport.s Editor
" With two races behind
them, the Bullet cross country
teams remain undefeated. The
teams, which are full of young
talent, have had a few surprises
in the first two races.
Junior Jon Catlett led
Gettysburg to a clean sweep
with a 5K time of 16:48 as the
Bullets defeated Western Mary
land, 15-50, in Centennial
Conference action last Wednes
day, September 3.
The Bullets had their first
13 runners over the line before
a Western Maryland runner fin
ished. The top seven runners
for Gettysburg were: Catlett,
junior Jason Rose (17:10), se
nior Brian Holden (17:17),
sophomore Devin Odom
(17:28), senior David Gary
(17:36), sophomore Evan
Merkhofer (17:40), and junior
Jon Wright (17:56).

The Gettysburg women
also opened their 1999 cam
paign with a victory, downing
the Green Terror, 21-38.
Sophomore Kustin Rob
erts led the way with a winning
time of 11:26 on the 3K course.
The Bullets' top seven finish
ers were: Roberts, 1st (11:26),
sophomore Megan McGolnck,
3rd (11:54), junior Kim
Heimerl, 4th (12:04), first-year
Melissa Hollman, 5th (12:11),
sophomore Lauren Davis, 8th
(12:24), sophomore Janel
Farrell, 9th (12:33), and junior
Kristin Mills, 10th (12:38).
Saturday the Bullets trav
eled to the mountainous course
of Juniata where they defeated
their hosts as well as Messiah
and Division I St. Francis.
Roberts won the
women's 3.2 mile race in a time
of 21:24 to lead Gettysburg to
three victories in quad-meet
action.

The Gettysburg women
defeated Messiah 27-29,
Juniata 15-49, and St. Francis
18-42, to improve their record
to 4-0.
Junior captain Kelley
Lord was very excited with

both teams' performances.
"Even though this was a tough
course, both the men's and
women's team stayed strong
and raced it well," she said.
"We have a lot of talent this
year and I think it's going to
be a good season."
Hollman (2nd place,
21:51) and McGolnck (5th
place, 22:20) also recorded top
five finishes for the Gettysburg
women. Hollman was awarded
the Golden Cleat for her sec
ond place finish and fine ef
forts. The remaining top seven
runners for the Bullets were:

Junior Jon Catlett races to a second place finish on Juniata's
mountainous course.

Davis, 9th (22:47), Heimerl,
13th (23:04), Lord, 14th
(23:11), and Farrell, 18th
(23:32).
On the women's race
Head Coach Robert Condon
said "Roberts is showing her
experience and controlled the
race right from the gun. And
the team gets a large boost from
number two runner, first-year
harrier Hollmann."
Condon is also thrilled
with the talented sophomore
class, who is just now beginning
to show their ability. Sopho
mores McGolnck and Davis
are returning

status as top finishers and jun
iors Heimerl and Kelley Lord
are rounding out the top seven.
Condon also believes that first
year Allison Small is a threat to
move up into the top seven
soon. On the men's side, Catlett
finished second in a time of
29:10 on the lone 8K course

to help Gettysburg defeat
siah 15-50, and St.
Francis 23-38.
Holden fin
ished third with a
time of 29:48 while
Odom placed fifth in u£
a o:

top ten. I
With the wins, I
the men improved to I

ners in the Bullets'
top seven were Rose,
6th (30:14), Wright,
7th (30:24), first
year Dan Campion,
8th (30:39), and se
nior Al Fianyo, 9th
(31:07). Campion's
standout perfor
mance in his first
ever cross country
race awarded him
the Golden Cleat.
According to
Condon, Saturday's
race held many sur
puses for the Bullets
in sophomore Devin
Odom and especially
in newcomer Dan

Campion, who looks to be a
permanent top five performer.
Condon is very pleased
with his team's initial outings.
"Both teams are showing excel
lent potential (top five in the
region), but need September to
put a solid and consistent team
effort together." This weekend
the Bullets will travel to the
Lebanon Valley Invitational.

Despite loss, Bullets not discouraged
Paul Smith inches closer to school _rushing record

by Mike Sanders -
Times Sports Editor
From Gettysburg Times

Presswire
It was billed as a clash of
offensive styles: Raruiolph
Macon's wide-open passing at
tack vs. Gettysburg College's
Wing-T rushing offense.
And that's basically how
the game played Saturday in
Musselman Stadium. The Yel
low Jackets' starting quarter
back, Brian Partlow, threw for
365 yards and five touch
downs; the Bullets' featured
running back, Paul Smith, car¬

ried the ball 18 times for 154
yards and a pair of scores.
But what ultimately may
have determined the outcome
was another way the two
teams' offenses differed.
Randolph-Macon, after look
ing pathetic on its opening pos
session, became nearly unstop
pable in the air, while Gettys
burg, although demonstraing at
times that it has more offensive
weapons than just Smith, was
inconsistent when it had the
hall.

"We were just too spo
radic (on offense)," Gettysburg
head coach Barry Streeter said

following his team's season
opening 54-20 loss to the Yel
low Jackets. "We did some nice
things, made some plays I was
confident we could make, but
then we'd get a costly penalty

Back to the drawing board: Coach Campo works with the linemen during practice
Wednesday.

or we'd drop a pass that we
should have caught. Those are
things that just kill promising
drives and they are things we
just can't afford to do."

Smith's 154-yard effort
Saturday moved him past Scott
Dudak and into second place
among the school's all-time
rushing leaders. At 3,813 yards,
the senior fullback now needs

only 39 yards to catch Dwayne
Marcus as the career rushing
leader at Gettysburg.
Smith scored twice from
a yard out in the first half, his
second TD run pulling the Bul¬

lets to within 17-14 midway
through the second period. But
the Yellow Jackets (1-0) an
swered with a three-yard scor
ing pass from.
Partlow ro Sean Raton on

their next possession to claim
a 24-14 lead at the half.
Partlow bunched three of
his TD passes into the third
quarter as Randolph-Macon
stretched its lead to 45-14. The

senior quarterback hooked up
with Tom Bush on plays cover
ing 58 and 11 yards, before
completing a 51-yard heave to
Michael Becker late in the pe
riod. Partlow found six differ
ent receivers before he was re
lieved in the final period. Eaton
amassed 134 yards on 10 re
ceptions and Becker caught six
passes, good for 109 yards.
"They pass-protected re
ally well," Streeter said of the
Yellow Jackets.
The Bullets (0-1) secured
their final points of the contest
on the first play of the fourth
quarter when Bryan
Pojanowski was on the receiv
ing end of a nine-yard pass
from starting quarterback Den
nis Flaherty.

Ryan Moore,
Gettysburg's leading tackier
last season as a freshman, was
in on a game-high 14 tackles
Saturday, but the Bullets sorely
missed another sophomore,
safety Matt Diamond, who sat
out due to an injured ham
string. "I'm disappointed with
the way we played today, but
I'm certainly not discouraged,"
said Streeter. "It's way too early
in the season and we did too
many things well today to get
discouraged."

Hobbled by injuries, women s soccer drops to 0-2

by Bill Davidson
Sports Editor
Fighting tough opposi
tions and their own injuries, the
Lady Bullets started the season
in disappointing fashion as they
dropped both games of the
Elizabethtown Blue Jay Classic
last weekend.
"The competition was
good," said Head Coach Todd
Wawrousek. "We matched up
good against both teams (de
fensively), but just couldn't cre
ate scoring opportunities."
In the opener, Gettysburg
and Wilmington played score¬

less soccer for 86 minutes. But
in the 87th minute,
Wilmington's Tammy Venema
scored the only goal of the
game en route jo a 1-0 victory
over the Lady Bullets.
"It was a lack of concen
tration," said Wawrousek, con
cerning the late goal.
Recording shots for the
Bullets were senior Patsy Cors,
juniors Whitney Jackson and
Rachael Rzemieniewski and
sophomore Sarah Myer. Jack
son played the game with an
ankle injury and was unable to
play Sunday or Wednesday.
Freshman Sarah
Fishburne recorded three saves

in goal.
In the consolation game
Sunday, Gettysburg dropped a
3-1 decision, despite
outshooting Nazareth 12-7 and
recording four corner kicks to
their zero. This was the sec
ond straight year the Lady Bul
lets fell to Nazareth in the Blue
Jay Classic.
After battling to a score
less first half tie, Nazareth
scored back to back goals just
46 seconds apart, early in the
second half, to take a com
manding 2-0 lead.
Gettysburg's only goal of
the season came in the 84th
minute by Emily McAuhffe,

while trailing 3-0.
Senior Maureen McBnen
and freshman Maura Tehrani
led the Bullets (0-2) with two
shots apiece on the afternoon.
Fishburne recorded two saves
in goal, despite playing with
multiple concussions.
Fishburne is now done
for the season and sophomore
Erin Hayden will filling in for
her. Hayden, a field player,

but Wawrousek is not overly
concerned. "She's willing to

said. "The team has a lot of

Every play, every player
fuels Gettysburg's hot start

The 1999 women's field hockey
team opened their season last Saturday
against Denison with a confident win
of 3-1. This showing compliments their
national ranking of 6th after last
season's Centennial Conference Cham
pionship and NCAA invitation.
Loosing to Rowan in the NCAA
quarterfinals ended the Lady Bullets '98
season on a high note. The team re
turns all but two of their starting play
ers from last season, therefore the pros
pects for the upcoming season appear,
to put it mildly, bright.
By the middle of the first half of
Saturday's game Denison was in the
lead by one goal. But just before the
halftime buzzer Gettysburg senior mid
fielder Laura DeSario sent a shot into
the cage unattested by the goalie.
That tied the score at 1-1. As the
second half progressed Gettysburg
found the back of the cage two more
times. Senior forward, Amy Stambaugh
and junior mid-fielder Kristie Moore
tallied goals. These two goals sealed
the victory for Gettysburg on their
home field.

After defeating Denison 3-1, the Lady Bullets prepare for today's game against Shippensburg

Another key factor in Gettysburg's
victory was played by junior goalie

Maureen Giese who was credited with
14 saves during the contest.
Spectators as well as players wel
comed an addition to Memorial field
this past weekend. A new Scoreboard
was erected earlier this summer and
DeSario was credited with putting the
first score up in lights.

The junior varsity team had a
great show against Denison as well.
They, too, swept their first game of the
season, 4-1. First-year players Janna
Donahue and Ali Potenza found the
cage for their first recorded collegiate
goals and sophomore Heather Witte
pounded in two more for the big win.
With a preseaon theme of "Every
play, Every player" the players are fac
ing each game one at a time and intend
to utilize their talent and characteristic
speed. Depth is a huge word in Lady
Bullets' field hockey. Not only do they
have a solid starting core of players, but
every player called off the bench has a
powerful presence on the field as well.
Head Coach Carol Cantele _^ has
the following to say about this year's
team, "We are in a great situation, our
team consists of a multitude of very

versatile players who can step onto the
field in any role they are given.
This adaptability gives us a huge
advantage because it is difficult to scout
our team because our players can be in
more than one position for the dura
tion of the game."
This year's team is lead by senior
tri-captains Steph Fisher, Laura
DeSario, and Lisa Beideman as well as
seniors Stambaugh and Tara Chipko.
On the team's performance this
past weekend, DeSario said, "Every
thing that we worked so hard on the
last two weeks really came together and
I feel that we are only going to get bet
ter." With high spirits and lofty expec
tations this year's team is striving to cap
ture another Centennial Conference
Championship as well as the NCAA
Invitation title.
