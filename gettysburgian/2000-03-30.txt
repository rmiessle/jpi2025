CNAV, Gettysburg College's web
based curriculum navigation program,
will not be exclusive to the
Gettysburg College community any
more. The College has started a com
pany to commercialize and develop
Curriculum Navigation so that it can
be marketed to other institutions.

CNAV will soon be on the market and available to other colleges and universities. This web
based curriculum navigation program is being promoted under a company called CNAV
Systems, which will sell the tool to other schools.

Gettysburg College.
Although
CNAVis

Systems a separate entity, the Col
lege is a major shareholder in the com
pany. "The College benefits trom the
products, and the company benefits
from the thinking," said Michael
Martys, the Vice Provost for
Gettysburg Colfege's Information Re
sources team.
CNAV has been under develop
ment since 1995, and has received in
terest from outside sources since that
time. "The College's decision (to mar
ket CNAV] is not a trivial decision,"
Martys said. "This is a carefully con
sidered idea."
Haaland added that research on
the national enthusiasm tor internet
based products took place to test the
question of broader community value.

Also, because of this period of adjust

ment, the development ot new CNAV
projects will slow while the company
develops. However, Haaland predicts a
tutuie ot "short term costs with long
term benefits."
"We had to weigh risks versus po
tential gain," Haaland said. "This project
looks to be a, huge beneficiary to the
college."
CNAV S\ steins is comprised of
nine employees, and lias been in exist
ence tor about three weeks. The com
pan\ will have two otlices; one on the
Gettysbuig College campus, and another
in 1\ son's Corner, Va. The College team
is working in partnership with the
_KPMG consulting conipam. KPMG is
an important component to the CNAV
_endeauir, as the consulting tirm otters
the benefits ot "experience and connec
tions."

Haalai d said.
CNAV will undergo developments
in terms ot maiketmg to other sources.
The greatest challenge will be working
with the installation of CNAV at other
colleges and universities.
"CNAV is like a window to data
bases," said Alice Huff, Programmer

"We didn't become eighth most

Quarry Suites celebrates grand
opening

by Barb Dickson
Ediior-in-Chih
Slightly over a year from
the March 6, 1999
groundbreaking for

the Quarry Suites, the
Inter-Residence Asso
ciation celebrated the
opening of the final
Quarry Suites build
ing by hosting a recep
tion m Quarry South.
The event, held dur
ing the lunch hour on
Tuesday, gave stu
dents, faculty and
members of the com
munity a chance to fa
miliarize themselves
with the newest hous¬

ing option on cam
pus. The Quarry

dorms consist of five- Students are very
bedroom suites. The Allson Black - Tim Ru P e < Maureen O'Donnell ('02) and Robin Roger ('02) share _piniuve ilbout the Qllcnry
four buildings to- m the festivities during Sweets at the Suites,a reception to mark the grand Suites. "1 hope I live heie
gether contain 165 opening of Quarry Suites

single rooms and 15 doubles,
housing a total of 195 students.
Most suites have five single bed
rooms, but other options in
clude havmg one double and
three singles, or two doubles
and one single. -
Corkran Hall and Quarry
West both opened on January
16, in time to house students
returning from abroad. Both of
those buildings house 40 stu
dents. Quarry North, housing
60 students, opened on Febru¬

ary 25 and Quai i v South
opened on March 12, with the
last 55 Quarry residents mov
ing in after spring bieak.
Members ot the Intei
Residential Association, an or
ganization consisting of a rep¬

resentative from each of the
residence hall governments,
and student focus gioups all
worked directly on the project,
helping to formulate the design
of the suites.
Each bedroom in the
suites contains a lofted bed, a
large computer-sized desk
(complete with a keyboard
drawer), desk chairs with "lean
back" recline, a bookshelf, and
built-in closets. The bedrooms
all contain TV, data/network

and phone access.
The common areas have
comfortable couches and
chairs, spacious bathrooms
(with a separate showei mom
for less backup in the morn
ings), and full-sized iehii;eia-

tors and microwaves.
Why are there no stoves
or ranges in the Quarry Suites?
Head of Residence Life
Tim Rupe replied that students
on the committees that helped
plan the Quarry Suites said that
they did not need full kitchens.
The kitchenettes at the suites
are not meant to be the same
as the kitchens in apartments
such as Apple and College
Apartments.
Each Quany building

also contains multiple common
looms and study aieas, com
plete with balcony. I heie are
also laundry And vending facili
ties and a _cennal, rully
equipped kitchen in each build

2000 Census Road Tour hits Gburg

by Kristine Meier Staff
Writer
On Tuesday, the occu
pants of a van parked in front
of the College Union Building
gave students gifts just for be
ing here.
Students, as well as pro
fessors, lined up to receive free
items including pens, pencils,
pins, magnets, flyers and t
shirts that read, "I count."
This conspicuous United
States Census van came to cam
pus to promote census aware
W ness to Gettysburg College stu
dents. It is only one of many
vans now touring the country
on the "2000 Census Road
Tour."

Students in Professor
Pamela Rosenberg's Sociology
101 class took a field trip to
the van's location to ask ques
tions about the 2000 Census.
According to Dilma
Garcia-Jones, Partnership Spe
cialist for the Department of
the Census, college students
were one of the largest under
represented groups in the last
census. By coming to
Gettysburg and other colleges,
they hope to remedy this prob
lem. "We are here to raise
awareness [among] students
about the Census because it is
important in this area and with
student participation," said
Garcia-Jones. "The govern
ment will give thousands of
|

dollars more to Adams
County."
Along with Gettysburg,
the "2000 Census Road Tour"
will visit more than 400 cities
in each of the 12 census regions
during a two month period.
National Census Day
takes place April 1. This marks
the deadline for returning com
pleted census forms, and ex¬

actly one yeai later, states will
receive their _redistncting
counts. The April 1 deadline
does not apply to colleges and
universities.
"We are trying to bring
Gettysburg and Adams County
census awaieness to the max,"
Garcia-Jones said.
Students living off cam
pus will have to fill out the

forms that they receive at their
off-campus residences and
should fill out only one form.
Students living on campus will
receive their own forms in two
to three weeks in their campus
mailboxes with further direc
tions. For further information,
students can log onto

Owl & Nightingale Players host festival

By S i'eve Spicer
Head Photographer
Last weekend Professor
George Muschamp stepped
aside and gave his students free
reign over Brua Hall.
"It was exciting and grati
fying to see a sincere effort and
exciting results in student ini
tiated theater activity," said
Muschamp who relinquished
control to the Owl &c Nightin
gale Players.
The O&N Performing
Arts Festival featured appear
ances from a variety of theater
styles, including a capella sing
ing, a student-written play and
a Broadway musical revue. Stu
dents wrote, produced, di
rected and performed the many
different shows.

"This was the first annual
performing arts festival," said

Gettysburg College .senior Tim
Funk. "I think it would be very
cool if it happened every year
after this."
The weekend started
Thursday with a concert by the
Four Scores, Gettysburg
College's a capella group. This
marked its first performance in
Kline Theatre.
The group of 10 was
founded about two years ago
by Doug Walsh and Jennifer
Bland. It recently released its
first recording, Four Score and
Two Years Ago.
The next presentation of
the festival featured a play, The
Green Eyed Monster, written by
first-year Gettysburg College
student Vincent Umbnno.
The play centers on the
main character, Jacob Miller
(junior Paul Lapato), and the
questions that Death asks him.
It focuses on how one man al¬

lows his emotions to iiile Ins
life as well as his afteihte.
The show came to lik 1 m
Stevens Laboratory Theatre.
Sophomore Rob Ortiz led the
cast of nine in this performance
which featured O&N regulars
like Lapato, senior Brad Cenlli
and junior Emily Stackhouse, as
well as Muschamp.
"I was very honored to be
asked to take part in this wholl\
original work," Muschamp
said. On Sunday, six students
played The $10,000,000
Broadway Challenge. Billed as
a musical revue, the game show
format added excitement to the
performance. Michael Harp
served as the revue's director,
with Erica Cronin as assistant
director.

Broadway's top musicals
contributed the songs for the
event. The production team

sampled songs from all types ol
shows like Les _Mtsciables,
Phantom of the Opera, RENT,
Ragtime and Chicago.
Moie than 40 student!!
donated their talents to pro
duce the revue.
"For having so many
people involved, everything ran
very smoothly," said Tim Funk,
who played electric and acous
tic guitai toi the production.
"All of the acis were good."
Also on Sunday, junior
Paula Henderson directed a
presentation of Angels in
America, Part I: Millennium Ap
proaches. Written by Tony
Kusher, the staged reading won
the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for
Drama.
Frank Rich of the New
York Times called the show a
"vast, miraculous
play...provocative, witty and
deeply upsetting...a search and

radical rethinking of American
political drama."
"My favorite thing about
this whole event is that it was
completely student-run and
student-done," Funk said. "It
shows how much we can ac
complish when we try."
"I didn't count noses, but
all of the shows appeared to be
well attended," Muschamp
said. Coming off such a full
weekend of activities only be
gins the Gettysburg College
Theatre Department's season.
On April 27 through May 1, it
will present Ghetto. The
drama centers on the struggles
of a theatrical company to sur
vive the plight of Nazi concen
tration camps in World War II
Germany.

Professor Susan Russell
will direct the production.

Students change direction of
programming
¦ ¦

By Anna Chongpinitchai
Contributing Writer
On Monday, March 6,
the executive officers of the
Student Activities Council
(SAC) announced their deci
sion to dissolve the organiza
tion, effective immediately, and
to work on creating a new pro
gramming structure.
"Our decision to dis
mantle SAC was based on a
changing need of the campus
and a goal to increase the scope
of social programming issues,"
said Karen Parker, president of
SAC. In the coming weeks, the
Office of Student Activities will
be leading focus groups to de
termine the best way to meet
student needs. The participants

in the first group will include
various social programmers,
such as current SAC members
and class presidents, along with
select administrators. Future
focus groups will include the
Inter-Fraternity Council and
Panhel.
"We are proactively seek
ing input from various groups
on campus to incorporate a
broader range of ideas and
needs in the new programming
structure," said Parker.
One possible structure
involves the creation of mul
tiple programming groups,
each with its own specific fo
cus. The list of proposed pro
gramming groups includes
Concerts, which would con
centrate on the main fall and
spring concerts; $0$, a funding
source for student initiatives;

Traditions, responsible for such
programs as Welcome Week,
Homecoming, Family Week
end, and Spring Fest; LIVE
Bands, which would focus on
smaller scale bands; Special
Events, responsible for uniqut
events such as Comedy Caba
rets and Murder Mystery Din
ners; and Noon Times, focus
ing on professional presenters
as well as faculty/student per
formers at lunchtime. Students
are also contacting other
groups to involve them in the
new structure.
"The intention is to pro
vide a framework for student'
to form groups around their
passions and to support these
groups in building a stronger
sense of identity," said Lynn
White Cloud, Assistant Dean of
the College/Director of Student
Activities.

This structure would al
low different groups to work
in conjunction with each other
while creating their own indi
vidualized set of rules, hich
group would have its own
chairperson. However, theie
would also be a "programming
alliance" of three or moie stu
dents who would meet occa
sionally to discuss more cam
pus programming issues, train¬

ing, and marketing of the new
structure.
"I think the structure
would function well to
promote people working to
gether," said Enka Strobel, cur
rent co-chair of the__ Concert
Committee in SAC.
In older to have some
kind of accountability, -
sentatives from each program
ming group would be required
to attend a certain amount of
joint meetings. Budgets for
each programming
¦ ¦ ¦ ¦ ¦ ¦
¦

would be designated at the be
ginning of the semester, and the
group itself would maintain its
own funds.
"I here is a possibility that
the chan positions would be
paid. If this proves feasible, the
chairpeison of each -
ming gioup would receive
minimun for a ceitam
numbei of hours per week. An
alternate suggestion was made
to cieate the chair positions or
the positions of the alliance
i;ioup as internships.
¦ ¦ ¦ ¦ ¦ ¦

Students and administra
tors aie currently investigating
the proposed structure. They
hope to have a new stiuctuie
developed bthe end of the
semester to implement next

The Junction Goes Irish

by Kristin A. Toburen
Staff Writer
This weekend, everyone's fa
vorite Irish band on campus will
entertain us once again. On Friday,
the Warrior Poets will invade the
Junction for three hours of good,
clean Irish fun. Well, maybe it
won't be so clean. The perfor
mance will begin at 9 p.m. and will
run until midnight, during which
time the Poets will get rowdy and
get the audience rowdy with them.
At the same time, they will be rais
ing funds for a worthy cause.
The concert will benefit the
Irish Children's Fund. The ICF se
lects two twelve-year-old children,
one Protestant and one Catholic,
from violence-ridden Belfast,
Northern Ireland, brings them to

the United States and places them
with one host family for a five
week stay. Consequently, the or
ganization helps to foster good fel
lowship between children of con
flicting religions and to build
friendships between them, a
friendship that they can take with
them when they return to Belfast.
Once back home, the chil
dren continue to participate in ICF
sponsored activities that shelter
them from the violence that most
of them have grown up alongside.
They also have the option of re
turning to the United States for an
other five weeks when they turn 15
years old. According to its website,
the "Irish Children's Fund is dedi
cated to building the foundation for
peace through the children of
Northern Ireland."

This concert will be the sec
ond benefit that the Warrior Poets
have hosted for the ICF. Member
Paul "Hutch" Hutchinson remem
bers that the first performance took
place two years ago on a Monday
night, and the band raised $200 by
selling tapes.

Because this concert will be tak
ing place on a Friday night,
Hutchinson hopes for a larger audi
ence. All donations and proceeds
from CD sales will be go to the ICF.
The Warrior Poets will not gain a
cent from the concert, but they will
gain a sense of satisfaction from in-

the Warrior Poets was formed in
1997 by three Gettysburg College
students who are all Irish in heritage.
Hutchinson joined with Ian
Isherwood and Jay Spiese and began

playing at Buckley's, the beloved
former Irish pub in town.
In nearly three years' time, the
band's fan base has grown, and so
has their membership. In addition
to the three original members, the
band now also features female vo

Who: The Warrior Poets

Why: To raise money for the Irish Children's

to happen, and students would be re

Hutchinson says that the band will
strive to create the Irish pub atmo
sphere in the Junction. The perfor
mance is BYOB. Hutchinson amus
ingly modifies the acronym, "BYOG

Bring Your Own

The key to a truly
successful Warrior Poets
concert is audience partici
pation. The members of
the band are not up on a
stage per se, but rather al
most on eye level with the
audience, thereby giving
the music a more personal
touch. The band members
encourage the audience to
clap their hands, stomp
their feet, scream out
"Argh!" and generally just
give themselves over to the
fun-loving rhythms and
lyrics of such traditional
Irish folk songs as the ever
popular "The Jolly Grog"
and "Tim Finnigan's

Stephen King: new and improved

BY _ANNh Sri II Nk
Book Ri-viiavi-r
Stephen King. The
Girl Who Loved Tom Gor
don. New York: Pocket
Books, 1999. 264 pp.
With no ideas for a
book to read for this week,
I picked up my _latent issue
of TIME Magazine and
found Stephen King staring
back at me from the cover.

It turns out that the all-time
champion of creepy books
just published a new story.
The hitch, however, is that
it is only available on-line.
Although King ranks
somewhere at the bottom
of my list of literary figures,
I thought it might be fun to
try something different. So
I jumped on the web and
starting checking out the
sites where I could down¬

load the sixty some-odd
page story and see how
good it is.
Well, it turns out that
downloading Mr. King's
on-line story, Riding the
Bullet, also requires down
loading the proper pro
grams with which to re
trieve the story: no easy task
for my antique computer.
With an estimated hour of
downloading in front of me,
I wimped out: my hardrive
was too large a sacrifice to
make for a Stephen King
thriller.
Fortunately for you, I
did find out that King pub
lished another story in e
book format last year. The
Girl Who Loved Tom Gor-

don was also sold in print,
and wouldn't you know: it's
available right at Wal-Mart,
without having to down
load a single thing!
The Girl Who Loved

Tom Gordon is about Trisha,
a girl who, well, loves Tom
Gordon, a Red Sox relief
pitcher.
Trisha loses her way in
the woods one day while hik
ing with her mother and

brother. The story continues
with her struggling to find her
way back to anyone or any
thing. With an eerie similar
ity to "Blair Witch", Trisha
seems trapped in the woods
and undoubtedly stalked by
something otherworldly.
As she struggles to main
tain her energy by eating ber
ries and drinking stream wa
ter, she listens on her
walkman radio to the outside
world giving up hope on find
ing her alive. And as her hal
lucinations become more and
more difficult to distinguish
from reality, she begins to lose
hope herself.
God seems to be ignor
ing her prayers, the mosqui
toes seem determined to eat
her alive, and something out
there in rhe Hnrk seems to be

marking her as prey.
The only Stephen King
I'm really familiar with is the
horror story King, the man

who writes stories like Car
rie, full of gore and all-out
terror. The Girl Who Loved
Tom Gordon does not, seem
to fit into the same category.
It's not about horror so
much as it is about suspense
and the agony of not know
ing what's out there. Again,
think "Blair Witch".
While I can't deny the
uneasy feeling I got from
reading the book, it didn't
really match the expecta
tions the name "Stephen
King" elicits. Of course,
that might be just as well,
since I'm not really the
blood and guts type.
All in all, The Girl Who
Loved Tom Gordon is a fast

read that will quicken your
pulse without giving you
(too many) nightmares. Try
it sometime if you need a
break from the usual intel
lectual college reading.

This movie should bo your "Final Destination

by Barb Dickson
EDITOR-IN-CHIfcl
If you're a fan of John
Denver's "Rocky Mountain
High," then I highly recom
mend you skip seeing "Final
Destination."
The question behind the
movie is simple: Can you
cheat death? The question
becomes pertinent when stu
dent Alex (Devon Sawa) gets
kicked off a plane bound for

France. He takes six people
off the plane with him: five
other students and a teacher.
As he sits on the plane, Alex
gets an all-too-vivid vision of
the plane exploding moments
after take off. After causing a
ruckus, the seven members of
the school trip are forced off
the plane. As they wait in the
terminal, they see the plane
explode, just as Alex said it
would.
Thirty-nine days after

the explosion, the rest of the
high school and the other sur
vivors regard Alex with high
suspicion, and the FBI is tail
ing him. It's at this point that
one by one, the seven survi
vors of Volee Air Flight 180
begin dying. Apparently, they
weren't meant to get off that
plane, and Death is looking tor
a little justice. And for many
of the deaths (as well as before
the plane crash), John
Denver's classic song is play
ing in the background.
From the moment the
plane crashes until, literally,
the last moments of the film,
the action doesn't stop. I don't
think my heart slowed down
for more than a few minutes
at any given point. The audi
ence is left wondering who
will be the next to die, and
how they will go. The writers
(Jeffrey Reddick and Glen
Morgan, both "X-Files" vet
eran writers) set up the deaths
in such a way that the audi-

Clear (Ah Larter) and the FBI check to see whether Alex
(Devon Sawa) is the next survivor to be caught by Death in
"Final Destination"

, , more _urucsome than the viewer
ence has no idea now each one ,
• . could ever imagine_,
is going to happen. And moru .... _, , . .
c . .,111 I he only who knows the
often than not, the death is way '

order of the deaths is Alex,
who figures out the pattern of
the deaths: they're dying in the
order in which they should
have died on the plane. Natu
rally he sets out to save the oth
ers, even the jerk he got into a
fight with on the plane
("Dawson's Creek ' s" Kerr
Smith) who insists on picking
a fight with Alex every time
they see each other . Also
needing Alex's saving are the
class idiot (Seann William
Scott-Stifler from "American
Pie"), Alex's best friend (Chad
Donella), the jerk's girlfriend
(Amanda Detmer), the loner
who believes Alex's premoni
tion (Ah Larter), and the
teacher (Kristen Cloke).

ceeds in doing what every hor
ror movie should do: keep you

Ultimate frisbee catching
on with all kinds of folks

by Harry Wlsshi
Knight-RiDDhR _Tridune
ORLANDO, Fla. —
J ackie Klappenbach and Eric
Arp tied the knot recently in
what ,can only be termed an
Ultimate wedding.
The two Orlando resi
dents, who wed in a courthouse
civil ceremony on Feb. 29, met
through the game of Ultimate
Frisbee and remain serious play
ers. Fellow Ultimate players
witnessed the wedding, and the
bride took part in her team's
Ultimate practice later the same
day. "You get all kinds of walks
of life in Ultimate," said
Klappenbach, 37, a former en
vironmental consultant for an
oil company and current full
time mom. When not practic
ing or playing Ultimate, she is
busy raising her and Arp's 2
year-old daughter, Sasha.

"With Ultimate you've got
New Age hippies, old school
hippies, computer geeks, engi
neers, physicists and attorneys.
Most Ultimate players are smart
and well-educated,"
Klappenbach said.
"I've tried a lot of differ
ent sports. This one has more
of an edge. It's not just a physi
cal game. It's a mind game."
Ultimate was born in
1968 — a year before
Woodstock — when a group
of Maplewood, N.J., high

school kids substituted a Frisbee
disk for a football and played a
rudimentary version of the
game in their school parking
lot. What began as a male
sport evolved over the years.
Men still dominate, but there
are hundreds of women's teams
across the country. There are a
growing number of competitive
coed teams as well, although
most coed games are played in
more casual pickup games in
the summer.

"What hooked me was
what a great workout you get,"
said Tammy Sabourin, 34, a
doctoral candidate who teaches
health and fitness classes at
Valencia Community College.
"All you need is a Frisbee, and

you get a lot of toning and
strength training. Plus, it's a lot
of fun. You run the length of
the field, there are just seven
players (per team), and you
call your own game."
Even at the elite com
petitive level, there are no ref
erees in Ultimate, Instead,
there's the "spirit of the
game," which most Ultimate
players take very seriously.
The game resembles
touch football — minus the
huddles — with plenty of
passing and catching and
points scored when a Frisbee
disk is caught in the end zone.
But there is no blocking and
no running with the disk.
Whoever has the regulation
175-gram disk must keep one
foot planted and get rid of it
within 10 seconds, or the
other team takes over.

"Ultimate is both team
oriented and individual ori
ented," said Jed Donahue, a
31-year-old Orlando physicist
who was introduced to the
sport in college and continues
to play year-round. "You
throw, catch and try to get
open. It's not like in football
where there's one quarterback
and everybody has a specific
role. In Ultimate, everybody
does everything."
Everything but relax.
Like soccer, play is continuous.
Although the ability to fling a
flying disk accurately and far
from all manner of angles is
important, the ability to keep
moving — and to sprint at a
moment's notice — is even
more important.

"There's more running
than in any sport I've played,
including soccer," Donahue
said. "It's kind of like playing
basketball on a football field.
Everybody is all over the held,
constantly in motion."
Perhaps because of its
counterculture origins, Ulti
mate is seen by the people who
play it as more than just a
sport. "It's an entire culture,
an attitude, a lifestyle," Mer
cer said. Weekend tourna
ments are as popular for their
Saturday night parties as they
are for their games during the
day. Practices and games often
end with players going out tor

drinks and schmoozing.
"The stereotypical Ulti
mate player is a granola hippie
type," said Demetnades, •> 1.
"But I've come across such ,i
wide variety of people. You see
a lot of people who arc into
outdoor activities like hiking
and canoeing. It's a game foi
free spirits."
And for people with
strong knees and ankles. Al
though there is no blocking oi
tackling, there are a lot of
people running, jumping and
occasionally diving — aka
"laying out" — after the same
Frisbee disk. Hard contact with
the ground and fellow players
is inevitable. As a result, even
diehard Ultimate players tend
to hang up their cleats in their
late 30s or 40s.

"It's tough on the knees,"
Demetnades acknowledged.
"There are a lot of ACL (ante
rior cruciate ligament) injuries
in the sport. That's the injury
of choice. Fortunately, I haven't
had any big injuries."
"We're open to anybody,
athlete or nonathlete," Mercer
said. "We're always patient
with beginners. It's when you
get better that people yell at

you. © Knight-Ridder Tri

Valuable
internship at

B\ LlHM Ml'ssl I M\N
Kelly Kemp giaduated
from Gettysburg College m
May 1999 with a major in
_history and a double minor
in Latin/polineal science.
This year, she lias
served as an intern in
Musselman Library rotating
among the departments to
gain experience in all areas
of the library. She has cata
loged books, helped students
at the reference desk,
handled letters dating to the
1900s in Special Collections,
processed interlibrary loans,
conducted focus group ses
sions and worked at the cir
culation desk.

Kemp was accepted to
the University of Pittsburgh
School of Information Sci
ences, and she deferred her
enrollment until Fall 2000 in
order to accept the year
long, full time internship in
Musselman Library.
Due to her strong aca
demic record and work ex
perience, Kelly was recently
awarded a graduate assis
tantship to support her stud
ies at the University of Pitts
burgh.
Anyone interested in
applying for the Musselman
Library internship for the
coming year should contact
Robin Wagner, Director of
Library Services at ext. 6768
or email rowagner.

Libby recently inter
viewed Kelly about her in
ternship.
LM: Why did you ap
ply for the Library intern
ship? KK: I already knew
that I wanted to do some
thing in the library. When I
was a senior, I did not think
that I would have enough

time to devote m\ attention
to applvmg to libran
school, because of my se
nior thesis and everything
else that goes on during se
nior year. I thought I should
take a year off after gradu
ation, so that I could apply
to graduate school later. I
also knew that I needed
money while doing that.
That's where this internship

came .
LM: What courses did
you take that made you in
terested in library work?
KK: History 300
(methods) had a profound
effect on my choice to be
come a librarian. I'd have
to say that all of my history
classes gave me a great back
ground in the skills that I
need to work in the library,
but History 300 actually
brought me into the library
and into Special Collections
and that's how I got my
work study job in the library
as an undergraduate to be
gin with.
LM: What are some
of the most useful things
you've learned with this in
ternship?

KK: I have expanded
my research skills and I have
also learned how to think
on my feet. I have learned
how to take a list of projects
and carry them through to
the end.
I've worked on some
special projects, too. For in
stance, I just finished pro
cessing my first collection in
Special Collections. It was
a collection of letters that a
cavalry soldier in Missis
sippi wrote to his wife dur
ing the Civil War.

The elementary school-aged
boys and girls enjoyed meet
ing Janell Cannon's Stellaluna
and Danny of Syd Hoff's
Danny and the Dinosaur fame.
The nationwide event
began three years ago, when a
National Education Associa
tion taskforce brainstormed
ways to show children's books'
potential entertainment value.
They reasoned that if children
read outside of the classroom,
then the children would surely
find pleasure while boosting
performance in school. So the
task force members designated
a nationally recognized day in
which educators and children
could focus their attention on
leading.

They chose March 2 to
honor award-winning
children's author Dr. Seuss'
birthday. Author of the popu
lar dreen Eggs and Ham, Dr.
Suess possessed a love of both
children and reading. The
NFA membei s agreed that vol
unteers in each state could
have the freedom of planning
how they might enjoy the
event. Students And employees
,u _Gettysburg College's CPS
decided to take part in the first
Lountiywide event. They held
the fust reading festival in the
junction and received a crowd
dI 75 students. Student vol
uniL-L'is sensed the children's

]
- s from page 7
excitement about leading and
) deemed their efforts successful.
The NFA surely agreed when 20
i million children horn all regions
¦ > of the nation celebrated the day.
Last year, the popularity
i of the college's celebration grew
as 125 students crowded into
5 the ballroom. This year, the
l college's schedule did not coin
cide with that of the rest of the
nation, so the Center for Public
Service's Literacy Program Team

held the event last night instead
of on March 2nd.
Sophomore Ceha Overby,
who works as Literacy Team
Program coordinator, felt very
pleased at the end of the night.
"I didn't participate last year, so
I have no way of comparing the
two. At any rate, [tonight's]
event went great. I'm excited
about the turnout, and I'm also
excited about the tons of volun
teers who put so much work
into it. And we even had books
left over," she said.

Both parents and children
shared Overby's enthusiasm.
"This is my daughter's second
year at the festival. She felt very
excited about coming. In fact,
she got sent home from school
today and was so worried that
she wouldn't be able to come,"
confided Elaine Fahey, who ac
companied her nine-year-old
daughter Jenny.
Luckily, Jenny felt well
enough to attend the festival.
"I'm glad that I could come,"
the third-grader said. Indeed,
she joined her friends, listened

to her favorite stones, and se
cured a copy of Bernard Waber_'s
Ira Sleeps Over.
As the children left last
night's celebration, many wan
dered through the College
bookstore. Some perused the
bookshelves, although they ap
peared more content with their
new books than with any of the
College's selections. No matter
what they choose to read, their
love of books will hopefully
giow. And by the time they
reach college, they will surely
feel eager to read to gain both
pleasure and knowledge.

Town-gown still
gone wrong
Last Satin clay I was leaving my
apartment on North Washington Street
to meet some friends when I heard the
screech of a c_<ir stopping suddenly. I
looked toward 7-Eleven, where the
sound seemed to be coming from, and
saw that a truck had stopped inches
away from a dark-colored sedan.
The sedan had pulled inio a park
ing spot at 7-F.leven and the truck was
perpendicular to it. The driver of the
truck, a woman, started screaming at
the driver of the sedan. She said:
"Where the h I did you get your li
cense? This is bleeping Adams County
bleeping Gettysburg bleeping Pennsyl
vania, not bleeping New York! You
bleeping college kids think you can do
whatever you want, driving around
here!" At this time, two college-aged
people got out of the sedan, yelled "shut
up," then walked into the store.

The driver of the truck then threw
her car into reverse and peeled out of
the 7-Eleven parking lot. Now I did
not see the whole thing happen, but it
looked like the driver of the sedan was
pulling into a legal spot in front of 7
Eleven and the woman in the truck was
trying to avoid the traffic light at
Chambersburg and North Washington
Streets by cutting through the 7-Eleven
parking lot.
Clearly, if this was the case, the
driver ot the sedan was in the right.
Obviously, this woman was mad that she
had almost been involved in an accident
and maybe even knew that she was
wrong, but instead of getting out of her
car to make sure that everyone was all
right, she took her anger out on the
driver ot the sedan, who mav or mav

Consider This....

Recent movies about space and interplanetary travel such as "Mis
sion to Mars" have sparked some commentary about our own space
program. After the Apollo series of moon landings, the pace of progress
in space exploration has slowed considerably. There are many ques
tions on why this slackening of public interest in outer space explora
tion exists.
The fundamental issue is motivation. During the politically sensi
tive 1960s, competition with the Russians cre
i 1 ated a natural desire to beat them to the moon.

taurants would follow in short order. Then, in
dividual self-interest would create a small movement of people to the
dangerous new world of living in space, or on another planet.
Without such motivation, we cannot truly expect federal agencies
of any country to muster the funds or backing for an effective space
program.

Today, only the altruistic goal of expanding our
frontiers can claim to be the impetus behind
exploration or possible colonization.
Some people have compared space ex
ploration to the Atlantic exploration and coloni
zation of the 15th century. There are parallels
between the two periods, but there are also sig
nificant differences. In the time of Columbus
Balboa, Cortes and other European explorers,
monarchs hired these men to search for the
riches rumored to exist in China and other East
ern lands which they believed to lie across the
Atlantic. Luckily we are not so ill-informed to
day about space, and know quite well that no
stockpiles of gold, exotic spices or alien slaves
await the first nation to colonize another planet
(at least in this solar system).
So the motivation behind any true expan
sion beyond Earth must come from the com
mercial sector. Industrial leaders must find some

profitable uses for space vehicles and coloni
zation technology. If they cannot, the United
States is likely to proceed very slowly in ex
ploring the rest of the galaxy. Pollution control,
zero gravity manufacturing or open space might
be possible motives for a commercial venture
into space. But without such initiative, we are
unlikely to develop the technologies that will
bring average citizens off our planet.
If industry or other businesses were to ever
relocate to another planet, the possibility for

Vote Masland in District Elections

by John _Duniap
POUIICAI CoiUMNIM
While most of us do not
hail from this congressional dis
trict, but are instead from a
north Jersey, greater New York,
or Boston area district, this is
the home district of our Col
lege. Many of our professors
and administrators, along with
most of the support staff live
in this district, and yes even a
few students (including one re
cent transplant) live here.
The 19th Congressional
District of Pennsylvania is in
the midst of a heated battle to
replace Congressman Bill
Goodhng. Goodhng, the chair
man of the House Committee
on Education and the Work
place will soon retire after
twenty-six years of service.
Before Goodhng was elected to
Congress, his father George
represented south-central

_Pennsylvania in the House.
Bill Goodhng plans to
moving on, perhaps to even
bigger things. A member ot
Goodhng's staff, who shall re
mam nameless, suggested Sec
retary of Education under a
President Bush. The Bush fam
ily owes Goodhng a lot. In
1980 Congressman Goodling
chaired George Bush's (the fa
ther, not George W.) success
ful presidential campaign in
Pennsylvania over Ronald
Reagan.
Now back to the race to
replace Goodling. Five very
impressive Republicans are vy
ing to win the primary next
Tuesday. Winning that primary
will be tantamount to winning
the general election, consider
ing the heavy Republican ad
vantage in the three counties
that make up the distnct.

The candidates are State
Representatives Al Masland

and Todd Platts, Yoi k Counn
Coivumssionet Chris. Reilly, at
torney Dick Stewai t, and tin ou
tline candidate Charlie Geiou.
My favorite is Al
Masland. In the eight yeais
that Masland has served in the
legislature he has distinguished
himself. This former prosecu
tor has led the tight to clean up
ethics in Harnsburg. He is a
mainstream conservative who
will be heard in Washington.
Not only does Masland
have the experience to be ef
fective on Capital Hill, but he
will be respected. His col
leagues in Harnsburg are over
whelmingly supporting him
over Todd Platts because they
know Masland can get things_,
done and will fight tor lower
taxes and education retoim.
After the Clinton years, pei
haps it won't hurt to have a
little ethics reform in Washing
ton.

Will Masland win? _The
battle will be tough. There are

two candidates from York
Counts, which is the giant ot
the district. To win, the two
horn York, Todd Platts and
Chris Reilly only need to do
verv well at home.
There appears to be a
backlash against Reilly tor seek
ing higher office so soon after
being reelected at home. He is
now running television adds
and is attempting to make up
for a slow start. The only prob
lem is that Ins message has been
to put seat belts on school
buses, which I did not know
was a federal issue. He sounds
like Bill Clinton with school
uniforms.
The other three candi
dates come horn Cumberland
_CountN, winch us the next big
gest. Foi one ot them to win
ihe\ must override the other
candidates in Cumberland, take
Adams big, and take some from

York. Most of all, Reilly and
Platts must to split York.
Bill Goodling recently
announced his support for his
longtime friend, Dick Stewart.
Ironically, I believe this en
dorsement may help Masland
or Gerow. Goodhng's base is
in York and in 1996 Charlie
Gerow actually beat Goodling
in Cumberland. The support
probably will not help Stewart
outside of York, but it could
help split the York vote, further
benefiting Masland or Gerow.
The Harnsburg Patriot,
The York Dispatch, and the
Cumberland County Republi
can Party have all endorsed
Masland. He has campaigned
hard in Adams County and in
a race where every vote will
count; yes-small Adams County
could play a big role. If you
are a resident of the 19th Con
gressional District, make sure
you vote. This is one of those
elections where it could really
count.

Town-gown

that the so-called "town-gown
relations" are not that great.
This negativity has bothered
me in the past, but never so
much as in this one incident.
This college has been here
since, what, 1832? I highly
doubt that this woman was
born before that date, so has
she really held this grudge
against the college her whole
life? Why would she choose to
live in a college town if she feels
so negatively toward college
students? I know that the
streets can get a little rowdy on
the weekends... my bed is right
by a window that looks out
onto North Washington Street,
so I hear all the loud people
walking back from the bars,
LD's, or 7-Eleven, too.

I have seen the beer cans
and solo cups thrown on
people's yards over the week
end. I agree that we could be
much more respectful of our
neighbors. But I really don't
think that such a strong preju
dice against college students

- continued
should exist for so long. That's
exactly what it is, too, a preju
dice. I have been standing in
line at WalMart and watched
this one particular cashier, an
elderly woman who must have
lived in Gettysburg for much or
all of her life, chatting happily
with another elderly town resi
dent or a middle-aged man
dressed in a flannel shirt and
boots purchasing bullets and
cigarettes. Then when she gets
to me, she just gets this dis
gusted look on her face and
immediately loses the will to
speak. Sometimes I try to
prove that I am not the devil
incarnate by making conversa
tion about the weather, and she
expresses a phony courtesy to
me, but I can just sense the ten
sion, the hatred. I really feel
like I've been discriminated
against just because I am a col
lege student.

I really don't understand
why this problem can't be
worked out. I know that this
community is close-knit and

pom page 9 -
unlike anything I come from
and maybe they view us as in
truders. Maybe they treat tour
ists with the same disrespect. I
don't know. All I know is that
for the better part of four years,
Gettysburg is our home, just as
it is theirs.
I can think of many ways
in which the town residents
benefit from having the College
here. I've been to College
events that are open to and at
tended by the locals. High

school proms and sporting
events are held here. I work at
the games room in Plank gym
and have, on a few occasions,
allowed some local kids to play
pool or ping pong even though
they do not have parents who
work at the school and techni
cally should not be using the
games room. Why is it that so
many locals refuse to focus on
the benefits of having a college
in their town and instead
choose to criticize us for being
a little carefree at times?
My opinion of the Col
lege has changed a lot in the

past four years, but the one
thing that has remained con
stant has been my willingness
to stick up for our right to make
use of this town's resources
without getting dirty looks and
negative comments from the
townspeople. I know that the
only town residents who read
this letter will probably be the
ones who work for the College,
but I still feel that this needs to
be said.
Maybe no one will read
this. I myself rarely read the

letters to the editor. But if you
do read tins and you agree with
me, make your voice heard.
We need to tmel a way to im
prove the town-gown relation
ships. I won't be here much
longer, but I think that it is an
important issue tor all Gettys
burg College students to con
sider. Finally, to the driver of
the dark colored sedan who
pulled into a parking spot at 7
Fleven at about 7: 10 p.m. on
Saturday March 25: I'd love to
hear from you.

Bettering the lives of American children

by Rachel Hanson
Columnist
Last Friday the Children's
Defense Fund released a report
that painted a very grim picture
of the lives of a great number
of American children today.
According to the report,
there are 13.5 million poor
children in the United States,
more than 70 percent of which
are from homes where at least
one adult is working. And
850,000 of these children are
homeless. The Department of
Agriculture also found that the

number of children without
enough food to eat increased
from 14.6 percent in 1997 to
19.7 percent in 1998, which
equates to an increase of 3.7
million children going hungry.
Perhaps the most interest
ing finding in the report deals
with the issue of race. Al
though more of America's poor
children are white than black
and more of them live in sub
urbs, rural areas, and small
towns than in inner cities, there
continues to be a great dispar
ity between the lives of white
and black children.

The infant mortality rate
of blacks is twice that of whites,
and "the cause of death is four
times more likely to be related
to low birthweight, suggesting
inequities in access to prenatal
care." And while the suicide
rate is much higher for white
children than for black chil
dren, the rate of suicide among

black children has increased by
100 percent since 1980.
It seems impossible to
think that there could be 13.5
million poor children in the
wealthiest country in the
world. But, once you think
about it, it is surprising that
there are not more. A person
who makes minimum wage
($5.15 an hour) and works a
typical 40-hour-week only
takes home $10,712 a year.
Even those who make $6 an
hour only earn $12,480 a year.
And those who make $7 an

hour (a fairly high amount
among the working class) still
only bring home $14,568 a
year. These numbers are as
tounding, but they are the
harsh reality for far too many
American citizens. They work
and they work hard, often in
the dirty and strenuous jobs
that no one else wants: they are
food servers, janitors, and even
housekeepers at colleges like
our own. They are doing the
best that they possibly can and
its barely enough for daily sur
vival.

So what can be done to
try to remedy this terrible situ
ation? Marian Wright
Edelman, head of the
Children's Defense Fund, has
made a number of recommen
dations, many of which call on
the government. She says the
government should provide
healthcare to the 11.9 million
children who have no insur
ance and should increase And

expand food piogiams "so that
no child goes hungi\."
Edelman also feels that
the government should use
some of the surplus foi pio
grams to help children, such as
Head Start. She also thinks the
government should raise the
minimum wage and increase
the earned income tax ci edit
for the working pool, saying,
"You can work full-time _,\_r
minimum wage and not be able
to raise your child out of pov
erty. We've got to raise the
minimum wage and allow poor
people to keep more money in
their pockets."

Since homicide is the
third-leading cause of death
among children aged 5 to 14,
Edelman also feels the govern
ment should met ease 1 emula
tion of guns, which she calls
"the one unregulated, dangei
ous consumer product." In
addition, because the 1 idlest
schools spend 56 percent mot e
per student than do the poor
est, and because the poorest
often have tewei books _,\m.
supplies and less qualified and
experienced teachers, there is
a great need to impro\e these
schools and hire more and bet
ter teachers.

I also think that the go\-
ernment should take on the 1 e
sponsibihty of pro\ tiling qual
ity _chtldcare. _ObuousU these
poor families almost al\\a\_s
need both parents to work,
which makes the possibihn ol
one parent staving home with
the children imnulisnc. And

untoi tunately a number of
these pool children come from
single parent homes, which
again necessitates good
childcaie. Most families can
not afford adequate childcare,
and currenth 5 million chil
dren are home alone after
school, which clearly is a prob
lem. The government should
take on this lole and ensure
that every parent can work be
cause they can feel confident
that their children are being
properly cared for in govern
ment-funded childcare facili
ties. Finally, Fdelman feels
that women should play an ac
tive role in improving the lives
of Amei tea's children. She says
that male decision-makers

"ha\e had the opportunity to
protect children, but somehow
then pi tonnes don't seem to
result" in bettei lives for chtl
dien. Fdelman says women
should push local, state, and
federal officials to create and
implement ptograms to really
_tmpro\e the quality of life tor
millions of American children.
In a country with so
much wealth and abundance,
this should not be the fate of
I _i.5 million children or even
one child. _Fveryone needs to
tight to gi\e them a better life
and better _oppoitumties, and
the go\ eminent should be
among the first to step forward
to protect the future ot
Amenca's _childten, even it
women need to force them to
ill) SO.

Nudity and the First Amendment

by Chris i ina Dickl-ri

Over what building
would you picture a flashing
neon sign that states "First
Amendment Rights Headquar
ters"? Maybe Larry Flint's
home, or some cheesy replica
of the Supreme Court. Who
knows? Maybe the Court it
self would have that sign, even
though the flashy neon would

not match the pristine white
ness of the building.
No, you could actually
find that sign flashing above the
entrance to Kandy's Dinner
Theater in Erie, PA. No, it's
not an artsy "dinner theater"
per say. Actually, it's a strip
club, and the only one in the
city where the women who
dance bare it all. That's right—
they're naked.
So what does a bunch of
strippers have to do with free

speech? Hie _auttalU uinl in

The city _officials believed that

G-stnngs. They said that an_>-
thing less would he public in

Kandy's Dinnei Theater
(which was then known as

prohibition of completel) nude
dancing was infringing on their

1 11 st Amendment 1 ights, so the
ownei appealed the decision to
1 he l'uins\ l\ an 1 a Supreme
( oiut. 1 Ik State Supreme
Couit sided with Kandyland,
saying that pi olubitmg women
who work as barroom dancers
to dance heel)' in the nude
would be _taking away from
their First Amendment rights.
Frie itself was appalled by
that verdict, so they appealed
to the Supreme Court. The
Supreme Court sided with Erie,
v. Pap's A.M
111 the case ot Etic v. 1

which was decided on Wednes
day with 6-3 vote. But that
does not mean that the justices
who voted to uphold the Erie
ordinance all had the same rea
soning.
Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor justified her decision
by saying that the Erie ordi
nance was not intended to sup
press the expressiveness of the
nude erotic dance, but the re
percussions that are involved
with such establishments, like
crime, public drunkenness and
violence. The other lustices

that agreed with Justice
O'Connor were Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist, Justice
Anthony Kennedy and Justice
Stephen Breyer.
The other two justices
who voted in favor of reinstat
ing the ban were Justices
Antonin Scaha and Clarence
Thomas. They took the con
servative, traditional moral
route and stated that it is the
government's job to be con
cerned with the moral well-be
ing of the community. In fact,
they stated that "nude public
dancing itself is immoral."

The three who voted
against the reinstatement of the
Erie ordinance were Justices
David Souter, John Paul
Stevens, and Ruth Bader
Ginsburg. Justice Souter said
that he did not see evidence
that the city really had intended
its ordinance to deal with the
crime that is a part of the world
of strip clubs. Justice Stevens
_,md Justice Ginsburg said that
"for the first time...secondary
effects [such as crime] 'may jus
tify the total suppression of
protected speech.'"
So who was right in this
matter? As a liberal and as a
feminist, I can see two sides to
this story. Like Justice
O'Connor, 1 can see that the
shady world of adult entertain

Irom the _Comermtim Corner
Governor Bush holds only viable plan for education

by Dan _Balifntyni
Columnis r

Over the last eight years,
Clinton and the Democratic
Party have, at best, only paid
lip service to education. The
results have been disastrous for
our children.
Reading scores have stag
nated and the literacy rate has
fallen to 97%. Test scores in
mathematics and the sciences
have fallen to the lowest of the
developed nations and have
shown no signs of improving.
We now have children killing
children in our schools and
drug use is up over 13.3% af
ter falling every year under
Presidents Reagan and Bush.
The result of this disinte¬

gration of our schools is that
we now have parents afraid to
send their child to school. The
Clinton-Gore Administration,
as well as Gore's campaign,
have done or proposed noth
ing but the same old Demo
cratic mantras that may sound
good to some, but do nothing.
And what is this "magical" so
lution that Democrats seem to
think work on every problem?
They want more government
and to throw money at the
problem. They want the Presi
dent of the United States to be
the head of a national school
board, whether that is what it
is called or not.

The trouble is, that does
not work. The schools in Wash
ington D.C. receive more fed
eral money than anywhere else
in the country, and are among
the worst schools in the coun
try. They also receive the most
federal micromanagement.
Iowa's schools receive one
eighth what Washington D.C.
does, and are significantly bet
ter than Washington D.C.'s
schools.
The Clinton-Gore solu
tion to shootings and violence
are even more perplexing. In
what have to be the most
shameless political moves 1
have ever witnessed, the Demo
crats do the political version of
ambulance chasing to push _uun

contiol measuies that do not
work and do not have anything
to do with what happened ev
ery time there is a school shoot
ing m this country.
Allow me to provide
some examples. After Colum
bine, the Clinton-Gore admin
istration pushed background
checks and raising the age you
could by a gun from 18 to 21.
Both of the killers were under
18; if the age had been 21,
nothing would have been dif
ferent. Also the guns used were
illegal, and no background
check would have occurred.
After the latest tragedy,
we again hear about back
ground checks. No background
check in the world will stop a
six-year-old living in a crack
house from picking up a gun
and shooting someone. It might
not be pleasant but it is the
truth.

On the drug issue, the
Clinton-Gore Administration's
efforts have been nonexistent.
Well, that is not exactly accu
rate; the Clinton-Gore admin
istration has severely hurt the
War on Drugs. Clinton joked
about his own drug use, which
only encourages our children to
experiment.
He has cut the Drug En
forcement Agency and the Bor
der Patrol as well as the
AWACS patrols along the
Mexican border. Also he has
recertified Mexico as a partner
in the War on Drugs even
though the majority of drugs
that enter this country come in
through Mexico, and many
members of the Mexican gov
ernment, including the Defense
Minister, have been implicated
in drug related corruption.

Governor Bush has a bet
ter plan, in fact, he is the only
candidate in the general elec
tion with a plan for education.
Governor Bush believes that
parents and teachers should
run the schools, not the
teacher's unions and Washing
ton D.C. He believes that par
ents should be able to decide
where their children go to
school through a voucher sys
tem and charter schools. He

also suppoits an accountnbihn
system which would ensure
that the federal money that
goes to our schools is. working
and if not, would correct the
problem. Governor Bush be
lieves that discipline and values
should again be taught in our
schools so that our children can
grow up to be functional mem
bers of society.
Governor Bush correctly
realizes that parents and teach
ers are infinitely better
equipped to make decisions on
how their school is run than

any bureaucrat or politician in
Washington. One sized fits all
Washington programs, whether
in education or anything else,
simply do not work. The needs
in the Rocky Mountains of
Colorado are different from
those in the plains of Illinois
and the inner city of New York
City. Parents know what is best
for their children and they want
their children to succeed. Cei
tainly there are exceptions to
this, but the overwhelming
majority of parents deeply care
about their children.

Governor Bush also real
izes that there must be an ac
countability system for schools
that take government, specifi
cally Title One, money. That is
taxpayer's money, your money,
being spent, and in many
schools it is not being spent the
way it should. It is not getting
results. Governor Bush will in
sist on results.. He is going to
implement an accountability

swem based on stand.udi7ed
test scenes, and those schools
th.u do not perform will have
to race consequences. The best
must be expected and de
manded of oui schools, and
Govei noi Bush will do that; he
will not kowtow to the
teachei \ unions.
Governor Bush also sup
poits-competition in education,
both charter schools and
vouchers. As the only innova
tive idea Goi e has in education
is chatter schools, which he
pi obably stole from Bradley or
Bush (I'm still waiting for him
to claim he invented them), I
will not go into them here.
Howevei, on the issues of
vouchers, the Democrats, and
Gore m particular, have not
only been hypocritical but have
told outright lies to the Ameri
can people.

They have claimed that
vouchers will leave less money
for those who remain in the
public schools. This is a he. The
federal government spends
$6000 per student, on average.
The voucher is only $2,000 per
student. This leaves $4,000 per
student that takes a voucher to
be spread around, and when
that is multiplied by the thou
sands to millions who will take
the vouchers, that is a lot more,
not less money to be spent on
the public schools per student.
Also, the same people
who decry giving the average
American the ability to send
their child to private school, es¬

pecially Gore, were products of
private education and sent their
kids to private education. The
reason for this hypocrisy is ob
vious, he thinks that public
school is not good enough for
his children, but it is good
enough for yours.
Governor Bush also seeks
to restore discipline and values
to our schools. He supports the
placing of the Ten Command
ments, upon which our crimi
nal law I based, in our schools,
if the parents and teachers in

that school decide they want to.
He supports voluntary prayer
in schools, both of which are
opposed by Gore, despite the
First Amendment protection of
the free exercise of religion.
He supports legislation to
protect our teachers and
schools from lawsuits when
they do what they have to do
to maintain discipline. In short,
he realizes that the problems of
discipline and violence in our
schools are caused by the de
cline of morals in America and
not an inanimate object.

Al Gore has no education
policy. All of his proposals are
the normal leftwing response to
everything: give the govern
ment more control over your
life. Governor Bush and the
Republican Party feel differ
ently. We trust you to run your
lives, run your schools, and
raise your families. Governor
Bush has an education pro
posal. Gore does not, nor will
he ever have a real one.

"So ghetto": A reality check

by Jus"i in Arnold
Contributing Writer
On the weekend of
March 4, Phi Kappa Psi frater
nity hosted a "ghetto" party.
Along with my friends, I chuck
led at the absurdity of such an
event. Imitating "ghetto" life
reminds African people of the
constant exploitations and ma
nipulations of the global Euro
pean/American power struc
ture. Europeans created, main
tained and continue to perpetu
ate ghettos enforcing African
enslavement, be it physical or
mental, continuing with the
American theme of racism lead
ing into the 21st century.
The Black community in
North America is defined by its
sharing of common space, ex
periences, views and value sys
tems and social institutions. Its
common space, however, is a
bounded area of living—i.e. a

"ghetto"-wluch not only locks
Africans in the community, but
simultaneously shuts us oft
from the assumed access and
various opportunities available
in the larger, systematically in
stitutionalized European/
American power base.
Even when Africans
move beyond the original
bounded areas to these subur
ban enclaves, these integrated
areas of course, typically out
skirt communities, also become
linked to the central Black area,
as white Americans leave and
other Black people move in.
Moreover, even outside the
"ghetto", Black people are de
fined and treated like the ma
jority who remain bolted in
these urban containers like sar
dines in a can. White American
racism and discrimination di
rected towards African people
is alive and thriving through
out the U.S., regardless of eco
nomic class.

Six basic dimensions l ir

where Black people at e concen
trated into few subuiban en
claves. Also, racist _housing
opportunities huthei entiap
Black people from moving out
of the "ghetto."
Second, the ghetto is ia
cial/ethnic, i.e., essentially Af
rican and a product or a racist
society which poses race, 01
what I would suggest, color, a'
a central criteria for determin
ing lifechances, opportunities,
social status and human dignity
and worth.

Third, the "ghetto" is so
cioeconomic, i.e., bounded by
social and economic decay.
Symptoms of "ghetto" life such
as frequent illness, early death,
drug addiction, alcoholism,
unemployment, poor and di
lapidated housing, poor educa
tion and crime are all accented
by the primary systematic af
fliction of inferior racial status
in a society founded upon ra
cial hierarchy.
Fourth, the "ghetto" is
institutional, i.e., it has a com¬

plex community or organiza
tions, institutions, and enter
prises, which aie both positive
and negative.
Fifth, the "ghetto" is
clearly political, i.e. it is both
an expression and pioduct of
African powerlessness m Noi rh
America that pi events oui es
tablishment and woiks to end
our existence 1 1 his powei less

"ghetto" is eonti oiled horn the
outside, .wo] it is this external
contiol coupled with addi
tional taetois of 'ghetto" lite
which h_.nc led some to know,
such as imselt, that the
"ghetto" is an internal colon\,
eieated, maintained and pei
petuated b\ the white Ameii
can powei struetui e of this
countn. Finally, the "ghetto"
is psycho-cultuial, i.e., defined
by views, values and conscious
ness, not of its own origin, that
is intentionally negative to its
development and transforma
tion into a free, proud and pro
ductive community.
If a thief can no longer
steal, his once vibrant mode ot
income is brought to a halt.

Despite these enormous set
backs, we continue to produce
cultural venues centered in Af
rican authenticity. For example,
Hip-Hop or Rap music. We
brought the world this type of
music in the early 80s. Initially
it was mocked, degraded,
deemed to induce criminality,
mimicked and hiwHy co-opted
by Europeans for mainstream
consumption. Additionally, the
products ot this totally African
musical genre have made mil
lionaires out of the very people
who initially despised and re
jected it - talk about hypocrisy.
Capital gains continue to ensue
m the white American main
stream as a i esult ot urban out
erwear such as Fcko, Mecca,
FuBu, DaLmkWent, Ph.it Farm,
Fince, I'_elie Pelle, Avirex, Kail
Kam, Dada and Triple 5 Soul,
to name a few.

We were told by design
eis to sta\ a\\a\ from then
clothing lines (do DKNY,
Abei ci ombie & Fitch, 1 1/

Polo etc. img a bell) so we set
oil to build out o\\n empne to
clothe oui own people. As a
u'sult, we make it \ou take it.
Untoi nmateh, Hip-Hop music
is becoming as American as
chci i \ pie. I his is the case be¬

cause young white Americans
have no cultuie; they just co
opt the cultui e ol Black people.
lie it wearing what we wear,
talking how we talk, acting
how we act etc., white Ameri
cans survive and _thn\e off of
Black people both on the con
tinent and, more specifically, in
the Diaspoia.
Finally, the next time you
begin, end or aie in the pro
cess ol one of your conveisa
tions and use "that's my dawg,"
or "whattup dawg" or "yo son"
or any variation of our lan
guage to communicate to
people, remember that you are
stealing from Black people, cul
ture, and history. This is the
strongest and most realistic ex
ample of the massive continual
co-opts on the part of white
Americans.

In conclusion, first, you
are free to go partying in Bed
Stuy, Yonkers, Newark, Soutl
Bronx, Compton, Dallas' 5th
Ward, Chester, New Orleans'
8 th Ward, Harlem or any over
whelmingly horrific places to
live or be. But until you do,
do not pretend that you have
the slightest clue as to what it
means to be, look, talk or live
"ghetto". It's not possible to
be disenfranchised for a night;
nor is it humorous to pretend
to be. Those who come here
from ghettos and attend school
nine months out of the year,

realize one thing that you
don't, they have to go back! For
you to trivialize this noxious
environment into a theme that
can be enjoyed (by you alone)
tor one night is as funny as a
sketch comedy skit about Jews
in ovens or mass showers. It's
_,m experience unparalleled and
\ou can't get it from listening
to DMX, Jay-ZJa Rule. While
\ on listen to it, we live it.
Speaking out language, wear
ing what we wear, and listen
ing to the \oices ot oui lives in
\oui apaitmentoi at the week
end haternity party won't get
sou the inescapable reality ot
"tihetto" lite.

Nudity
continued from page 11

ment can lead to some crime
and violence. Many women
who are employed in this kind
of work are the objects of such
violence. When I first heard of
this case, I also jumped on my
feminist soapbox and was pre
pared to argue that women
should not have to do such in
decent work to earn a living.
Whoever would go to the strip
club could use there imagina
tion to picture whatever is un
der the G-stnng or the pasties.
Women should not have to bare

it all. Then I stepped off of my
feminist soapbox and reverted
to the Jerry Springer- watching
college student that I am and
examined Justice Ginsburg_'s
aigument. Why should these
dancers and these establish
ments be suppressed because of
people who think that nude
dancing us indecent? Why
should the action of nude danc
ing (or the degree of "nudity"
permitted) be affected by things
that are related to the world ot

seedy adult entertainment?
This is America for cry
ing out loud. We should be able
to get as naked as we want. If
women feel comfortable danc
ing in the nude, having them
wear pasties and G-stnngs are
not going to help matters
much. They don't cover up
much either. I think that if
people know what they are get
ting into when they join up
with the world of adult enter
tainment, then they are respon
sible for their own well being.

We, as Americans who
love our freedoms, cannot pick
and choose what is worthy of
being protected of First
Amendment rights. We cannot
say that nude dancing is not
"good enough" to be protected
by the First Amendment. That
is not our judgement call.
Americans need to protect the
fiee expression of everyone,
whether you believe that nude 1
dancing is lewd or that it is _,i
legal profession. We can't be
snobby with our rights.

Rain doesn't stop Bullets Track
from shining in season opener

by Lauren Davis
Assistant Sports Editor
There was rain and there
was wind, but the sun finally
came out yesterday evening to
welcome the Bullets' track team
into the spring season. In spite
of wet conditions for most of
the meet, Gettysburg athletes
shone all around as both the
men's and women's teams fin
ished second in a quadmeet
with Messiah, Johns Hopkins,
and Columbia Union.
The men's team finished
with 164 points, just behind
Messiah (170), while defeating
Johns Hopkins (152) and Co
iumbia Union (10). The victory
over conference rival Johns
Hopkins was significant, as it
proved that the Bullets' defeat
of Hopkins in the indoor con
ference meet was no fluke.
Senior Mike Williams
and junior Jon Catlett high¬

lighted the men's meet; both
were victorious in two events.
Williams far outdistanced his
competitors in both the shot
put (43'02 1/4") and the discus
(134'08 1/2") to pick up 18
points for the Bullets' cause.
Classmates Gene Kraus
and Scott Grabus added points
in the throws as well, Kraus
took 2nd, 4th, and 5th, in the
discus, shot put, and javelin
while Grabus threw 145'06" to
finish 2nd in the javelin, just 3
inches behind the first place
throw.
Meanwhile, Catlett initi
ated the men's scoring on the
track with a firstplace time of
10:04.26 in the steeplechase,
followed by sophomore Bryan
Brander in third place.

Catlett came back to win
the 5000, coming from behind
to take the lead in the final 800
meters of the race and secure
the victory in 16:08. Classmate
Jason Rose was ten seconds
behind, taking third place for

the Bullets.
Gettysburg also had sev
eral single event winners. Jun
ior Nick LaPorta dashed to a
12.07 in the 100, while first
year hurdlers Chris Buchanan
and Phil Ferarro each won an
event, Buchanan taking the
100-hurdles in 15.5 1 and
Fprarrn in the 400-hnrHles,

(58.47).
Other notable pei for
mances for the Bullets included
3rd places from sophomore
Evan Merkhofer in the 1500
(4:16.29) and junior J.T.
Fan ell, who ran 52._^6 in the
400, and the 4x400 team that
closed the meet with a victoi y
in 3:29.82.
On the women's side, the
Bullets scored 174 points, 10
points behind first-place Mes
siah and far ahead of both
Johns Hopkins (103) and Co
lumbia Union (10).
Senior Anne Schenck
proved that she can do it all,
picking up victories in both the

high and long jumps (5' and
15'06 3/4", respectively), as
well as the 100 (13.23) and 200
(27.22). Classmate Cathy
Spangler took care of business
in the throws, winning the shot
put in 32'08 1/2" and the dis
cus in 97'03 1/2".
First-years Joanna Silver
and Lara Knudsen each
chipped in 9 points with first
place finishes in their events.
Silver took the 400-meter
dash, blowing the field away
with an impressive time of
_S_9.2 3, suieiy a promise of even
better things to come as the
season progresses.
Knudsen thiew the jav
elm I()6'()i 1/2, six feet further
than her nearest competitor.
The Bullets also captured
gold in the 4x100 and 4x400
meter relays with times of
S2.55 and 4:14.17, respec
tively.

The distance team con
tributed points as well. Junior
Tracy Swackhamer finished

third in both the 1500 (5:11.2)
and the 800 (2:36.24). Sopho
mores Emily Lanning and
Kristin Roberts picked up seven
points apiece with second place
finishes, Lanning's in the 800
(2:34.87) and Roberts's in the

3000 (11:18.35).
Both coaches and athletes
were pleased with the team's
overall performance this early
in the season. "Despite the less
than-desirable weather, each
member of the team put forth
his or her best effort, and
seemed pleased with the re
sult," said Roberts.
The Bullets travel to the
Christopher Newport Invita
tional in Virginia this weekend,
where they will face stiff com
petition against several Divi
sion I schools.
"It will be a good test of
our team's strength and depth,"
said Roberts.
With Tuesday's showing,
both teams have proven that
they are up to the test.

Lady Bullets achieve back-to-back victories
Gettysburg Women's lacrosse ranking climbs from 15 to 10

by Lisa BnnrM>\N
Staff Wri _ter
This past week proved to be an
other exciting and victorious one for
the members of the women's lacrosse
team. The Bullets climbed from
No.15 to No. 10 this week in the
National Coaches Poll with two vic
tories on the week.
Last Thursday, the Bullets trav
eled to Messiah College for a non
conference match up. The learns
battled scorelessly through the first
eight minutes of the game until fresh
man attacker Katie Merriken scored
off a pass from first-year midfielder

Megan Murphy.
Sophomore Anna Haugen
hammered in two of the next three
goals to put Gettysburg on top 4-0.
By the end of the half, the Bullets
were leading 11-1.
In the second half, first-year
Kathryn Grassel set the tone early,
finding the cage just 11 seonds in.
From there, the Lady Laxers breezed
to a 20-4 victory.
Junior Susie Mitchell, sopho
more Becky Bucha, and senior Amy
Stambaugh were among 13 players
who scored goals for the Bullets.
First-years Regina Brouk and
Abbe Carr recorded their first colle
giate goals in the contest.
Following that performance

the Bullets prepared foi their first
Centennial Conference match up,
and home opener, against No.-10
_Ursinus.
The opening minutes of
Saturday's contest proved-deceivmg
for both teams, as the Bears jumped
to an early 4-0 lead. Then within 34
seconds, Merriken and Bucha
chipped in goals. After one more
slipped by goalie Michelle Centrella,
the Bullets tore into Ursmus's defense
with six unanswered goals, staking a
three goal lead they would never re
linquish.
The Bears found the cage one
more time, but within seconds

to a 13-7 halftime lead.
"After Ursinus took the lead, we
shook them off, and when Merriken
made that first goal, we knew we
could take them with confidence and
speed," said Haugen.
In the opening minutes of the
second half, Gettysburg found the hot

ning streak to five and marked the
fourth 20-goal game in the last five
contests.
This season's theme, "Find a
way to make it happen. Whatever it
takes" certainly seems to be holding
true. These women certainly are giv
ing it their all and finding it within
themselves to get the job done.

spots two more times to increase
their lead to 15-7. Bucha led the
Bullets with a career-high six goals,
while Haugen and junior Jessica
Seedorf both recorded hat tricks.
Senior midfielder Kim Fernandez
aided the rampage with two goals.
Bucha's performance earned
her Centennial Conference Player of
the Week honors. She has now
scored four or more goals in six con
secutive games.
Gettysburg outshot Ursinus 46
30 and lead in draw controls 23-16.
The 24-14 victory marks only the
third win in 20 tries for the Bullets
over the defending Centennial Con
ference Champs.
