TKE_'s troubles
trivial ?
House closed, but not for long

by Rebecca Babbit
The Tau Kappa Epsilon house, which
planned to undergo a $500,000 renovation
this year, sustained $30,000 in damage when
an unknown number of TKE brothers
"kicked in walls and windows," said TKE
president, Danny Smith.
The incident occurred during final
exam week last semester on May 8 and 9.
"There were 10 to 15 people in the house,"
said Smith. "There was really nobody
around."
Legal action is being taken against the
brothers accused of vandalizing the prop
erty. All disciplinary action against the
brothers accused of causing the damage has
been initiated by the TKE Board of Advi
sors, a group of alumni who act as a hous
ing corporation. Neither the college nor
TKE nationals have taken action against any
of the brothers regarding this incident.

TKE's renovations were set to begin
this summer, however, "'because of the
amount of damage, the project has been
pushed back a year," said Smith.
TKE alumni were able to raise
$550,000 to pay for renovations-the most
of any house on campus.

The College was considering loaning
up to $300,000 to TKE as part of a program

to renovate fraternity houses on campus, but
is now reconsidering the offer.
"We are not prepared to give them
money, until we are convinced they are
moving in the right direction," said Dennis
Murphy, Dean of Greek Organizations.
Most of the brothers are living off
campus, according to Smith.
"The house is not livable," said Jason
Gareis, President of the Interfraternity coun
cil. "We basically told them, 'you're on
your own'" said Murphy. "This is an un
usual situation. We're not in the position to
house 25 more students."
TKE is "running the same," said
Smith. "We are not in trouble."
"This adds pressure from sources that
had negative ideas about the greek system,"
said Gareis. "It's fuel for the fire."

"We're going to have to work hard to
get more positive publicity," said Gareis.
The Psi chapter of TKE was founded
at Gettysburg in 1926 and currently has 33
active brothers.

Student Senate highlights: 9/1/97

byDanLarkin
News Editor The Gettysburg College
Student Senate held its first meet
ing of the 1997-1998 academic
year Monday evening.
President Abbey Rodgers
opened the meeting by welcom
ing back the returning senators.
Rodgers stated that Senate's main
goal for the year would be "alter
native social programming," and
the majority of senate business
should focus on this goal. She
also stated a desire to reduce the
time of senate meetings, with an
emphasis placed on "quality, not
quantity."
It was announced that elec
tions for first year senators and

class officers will be held on
Wednesday Sept. 10 and Thursday
11. All first-year students who are
interested are encouraged to attend
information sessions held in the sen
ate offices.
The formation of a commit
tee was announced to submit a pro
posal to the College for the creation
of a dance club in currently vacant
warehouse space beneath the Ma
jestic complex. Ideas for this club
include a disco and a bar for stu
dents over 21. Ideas for this project
were said to be "very vague right
now." Senate treasurer _.Sara
Zalewski announced that Senate's
budget currently stands at around $

16,000. According to Zalewski, the
budget was cut about 5% from last
year. Due to the budget cut and the
cost of outstanding bills, all senate
sponsored student organizations
were cut 20% of their previous bud
gets. She said that money was re
moved from Senate's budget to
help fund the _organisations. She
urged organizations to spend their
money wisely, and to co-sponsor
events with other organizations.
She also announced that Sen
ate will begin implementing fines
this year for poor attendance and
failure to meet other responsibili
ties. All senators, officers, and or
ganizations will be subject to these
fines.

College Store committee makes decision

byDanLarkin
News Editor

A committee formed to re
view and redefine the mission of
the Gettysburg College Store has
reached a conclusion concerning
the direction of the bookstore. The
store has begun to implement these
changes this semester.

The College Store Re
view Advisory Committee com
prised of faculty, administrators,
staff, and a student was appointed
in the fall of 1996 by Vice Presi
dent Jennie Mingoielli to set a vi
sion for the College Store and to
identify key initiatives and direc
tions for (he future.

Much speculation and
rumor concerning the College's
plans for the store created contro
versy on campus last semester.
Concerns were raised about the
possible outsourcing of the store
to a large corporation, such as
Barnes and Noble, and the poten
tial budget and personnel problems

that would bring with it.
As part of the review pro
cess, the committee solicited sug
gestions from members of all sec
tors of the community; visited
bookstores on other college cam
puses; interviewed and heard pre
sentations from the Gettysburg
College Store staff; and met with
an architect to review design op
tions. The committee resolu
tion states that "two major themes
emerged from our review of the
current situation: first we recom
mend that the College improve the
selection and offering of trade
books in the College Store and sec
ond, we recommend that the Col
lege Store be oriented more toward
supporting an intellectual atmo
sphere on campus."
With regard to the
Store's location, the resolution
states: "The issue of location of the
store/bookstore is absolutely criti
cal to the success of the store. We
believe the store must be in a high
traffic location."

It continues to state that
"We lack consensus within the
Committee on whether to separate
the college store physically from
a new bookstore, or whether the
bookstore can encompass the Col
lege Store and share a location."
The Committee recom
mended two phases to resolve the
location issue: "Phase 1 — an ex
pansion in or around the present

We need
writers
x6449

phtoto by Mark Astrom

location, with emphasis on short
term, low cost options; Phase 2 -
a new space renovated, built or
acquired to design specifications."
The Committee also rec
ommended to move immediately
into Phase 1, and "hold off on any
major expenditures until we have
two to three years of experience to
evaluate the success of Phase 1."
In conclusion, the Advisory
Committee stated: "The store must
house a stronger selection of trade
books and that the store must play
a more significant role in foster
ing an intellectual climate on cam
pus. The store can become far
more fully engaged in promoting
a lively conversation about books
among students and faculty. The
store can serve as a natural venue
for intellectual book-centered pro
gramming and casual interaction.

We seek a bookstore with a
bookstore ambiance. We aim for
a program which not only sells
books, but which celebrates the en
joyment of books as both a soli
tary and communal activity. By
implementing the recommenda
tions proposed above, we believe
the College Store can better
achieve this very important aspect
of its mission."

Paparazzi to face probe for
role in Princess' death
PARIS
A French Judge tuesday de
clared seven paparazzi to be sus
pects in the death of Princess Diana
early Sunday morning in a car
crash. The Princess' armored
Mercedes-Benz sedan crashed af
ter a high speed chase by celebrity
hunting photographers on motor
cycles through a tunnel.
Newly disclosed informa
tion, however, has pointed at a com
bination of deadly factors leading
to the Princess' death.
A police analysis found
that chauffeur Henr i Paul's blood
alcohol level may have been almost
four times the legal limit at the time
nf the crash.

The photographers had
been in custody since being ar
rested at the crash scene Sunday
morning. Judge Herve Stephan
placed them under formal investi
gation for "involuntary homicide,"
the French equivalent of man
slaughter. They will not necessar
ily be formally charged with any
cr ime. The paparazzi will also be
investigated for failing to aid people
in danger, under French "good sa
maritan" law. If they are charged
and found guilty, the paparzzi face
potential punishment of up to five
years in jail and $100,000 in fines.
Huge crowds engulfed St.
James Palace earlier this week
where Diana' s body lay in state
until Saturday's funeral.

Senate investigates VP's
role in temple fund-raiser

As White House officials
again proclaimed Vice President Al
Gore's innocence, Senate investiga
tors Tuesday prepared to lay out a
strong case that Mr. Gore knew all
along that an election-year event he
attended at a Buddhist temple in
California was a fund-raiser.
Senate sources said in

video-tape of the April 1996 lun
cheon at the Hsi Lai Temple out
side Los Angeles. They plan to re
trieve the video form the Temple's
headquarters in Taiwan.
In effort to clear the Vice
President of any wrong-doing,
White House officials stated that he
was in the dark about the session,
which raised more than $166,000
for the Democratic Party.
Of the event, Mr. gore said
"It was a mistake. BUt I was told it
was not a fund-raiser, and that's a
fact." Postal worker attacks wife,

The man left his station at the counter when he saw the two
women enter the post office about 1 p.m., said a police spokesman.
Each victim was shot once, and then the gunman walked away
casually, police and witnesses said.
"Exited the post office, went to a tree, looked up in the air and
shot himself in the face," the spokesman said.
Police identified the gunman as Jesus Antonio Tamayo, 65. A

Catholic school teachers begin year on picket lines
Lay teachers at the 22 Catholic high schools in the Archdiocese

signs, then headed to the archdiocese's downtown headquarters to form
a picket line for their first strike since 1976.
The old contract expired at midnight Sunday; the archdiocese
refused to negotiate past last thursday but indicated it would resume
talks this week.

New policies reduce diversity

College Press Service
Laura Rothstein, a Univer
sity of Houston law professor,
says she's gotten a taste of what
a classroom is like with fewer
minority students.
Speaking to a civil rights
advisory group in Austin,
Rothstein recounted how a recent
class discussions on housing dis
crimination was far less heated
than in past years, when more
minority students were in the
class. This year, only two black
students are enrolled in her pov
erty laws class.
"All of the students in my
class were harmed because of
that loss. Affirmative action
doesn't just benefit minorities, it
benefits all students."

plications from Hispanic students
fell 22 percent.
Applications from white stu
dents dropped too, by 14 percent, bul
overall more white and Asian stu
dents received offers of admissions
this year than last. That reverses a
trend toward increased college en
rollment of minority students over
the last decade, recently outlined in
report by the College Board.
In Texas, university officials
say one reason for the decline is a
new essay requirement that deters
less ambitious applicants. But
some blame "the Hopwood effect,"
a reference to the federal court case
that blocked most college sin Texas,
Louisiana and Mississippi from us
ing racial preferences in undergradu
ate admissions and scholarships.
In 1992, Cheryl Hopwood and
three other white students sued UT's
law school, saying they had been
denied admission so that less quali
fied minority students could be ad
mitted. A federal appeals court
agreed that the UT's policies were
discriminatory.
The Texas system adopted
a "race-neutral" policy and now
gives more consideration to an
applicant's experience overcoming
adversity or other special circum
stances. Still, fewer minorities have
been accepted.
Experts predict that many
minority students will accept offers
form private universities that still
offer race-based scholarships.

Even as national surveys
show solid gains in college en
rollment for minority students,
several campuses say the end re
sult of bitter affirmative action
battles is a sharp decrease in mi
nority applicants.
Following decisions to dis
mantle their race-preferential
programs, public universities in
Texas and California report that
applications form black and His
panic students for next year's
freshman class have plummeted.

The Greek Word

by Erin Patterson and Kevin
Howard Public Relations Chairs - Panhel
and IFC This is the introductory
article of a column that will in
form the public of any and all
Greek events. Since this is the
first one we don't have much in
formation to dish out, but we'll
give you what we've got.
Good news First-Year stu
dents ! At the IFC (InterFraternity
Council) meeting of September
1, 1997, the amendment to pre
vent First-year Students into any
registered social events at frater
nity houses prior to Reading

Days was repealed, so hrst-year stu
dents are now permitted to attend the
parties, assuming they are invited, of
course. Just some guidelines for you
to try to adhere to : the houses on
campus are the residences of many
students, and those students who live
in those houses take a lot of pride in
them, and would sincerly appreci
ate it, if you too would respect their
house as much as they do. The last
thing a brother wants to see in his
house is students vandalizing his
house in any way. Always remeber
that no matter how many people you
know, you are still a guest in another
person's house, and that person al
ways reserves the right to ask you to

leave. Hopefully this will not be a
problem, but we wanted to clarify
it just in case.
In other news, this week
end SAC put on another great show
with the Gibb Droll Band, and yes
you weren't mistaken, there were
two Greek organizations out there
setting up the stage Friday after
noon and taking it down later Fri
day evening. The brothers at Al
pha Tau Omega volunteered their
time to help with the logistics of
the concert by setting up the stage
and the band's equipment. Later
that evening, the brothers of Alpha
Chi Rho also volunteered their
time to "load out" the band's

equpiment and take down the
stage. We want to take this time
to congratulate those two organi
zations on a job well done.
On the sorority scene,
just a reminder that the meeting
time for Panhel has been changed
to 6:15 on Monday evening at
CUB 260. Make a note of this,
and remember anyone is welcome
and encouranged to attend. An
other minor change in meeting
time for IFC has also been made.
The meeting will now take place
at 8:30 and will still rotate from
house to house.
We want to take this time
now to ask all Greek organiza¬

tions who want to have something
mentioned in our column to con

Fall concert with "a peel":
Fiona Apple to rock CUB

byBarbDickson
Features Editor
The Student Activities Coun
cil has announced the singer who
will at the Fall Concert. On Satur
day, November 1, singer Fiona
Apple will be playing in the CUB
Ballroom. Tickets will be $ 18 with
Gettysburg College ID, or $21 to
the general public in the lobby of
the CUB (among other places), and
go on sale in mid-October
This 19-ycar old singer has
lelcascd only one album so far, but
that album, Tidal, has already gone
gold, having sold ovci 500,000
copies all over the woi Id Apple is
known ioi her songs "Criminal"
and "Shadowboxci," both ol which
have videos currently playing on
MTV Apple will peiionn on the
MTV Video Music Awards tonight
at 8pm, and she is up Ioi the
_avvaid ol Best New Artist

Apple's album consists
mostly ol the aitisl accompanying
herself on the piano, with peicus
sion or guitar on a few tracks Her
songs deal mainly with suffering
and pain, which is undeistandablc,
since Apple was laped at the age
of 12. "I've lived a lot in my little
lilc," she says, "but I'm not saying
that I know something about rela
tionships or life. I just say what I
feel and what I know."
Apple grew up in Manhattan,
the child of a former dancer and
singer and an actor. Her parents
never married. Apple was so de
pressed that her mother sent her to
a psychiatrist as a child, and she
developed an interest in writing,
from which grew a fascination with
songwriting She wrote to provide
an emotional outlet to satisfy the
desire to express herself. "I didn't
think of it as a fun thing to do," she
commented. "I thought it was the
only thing I could do."

Apple has very deep feelings
about her music, and music in gen
eral. "The way I feel about music
-any song, any style—is that there
is no right and wrong, only true and

SAC announces concert planned for November

false. If the music and lyrics
are conceived out of honesty
and if the production of the
song goes along with its origi
nal message, then what has
been expressed is art, regardless
of what anyone's opinion is of
it. So things arc a lot simpler if
you just tell the truth."
Apple didn't envision

herself as a performer when she
was younger. "It wasn't that I
didn't think I had a nice voice, but
I consider myself more of a
writer. I've played piano since I
was about eight, and always
wrote songs—I sang them be
cause it wouldn't make sense for
anyone else to."
And her throaty, smoky

Iionapics/picl20 Ipg
voice is perfect for her songs. "People
expect me to be an old black woman
when they hear my music," Apple
commented. She was influenced by
blues singer Billic Holliday, which
may help explain this.
Many students were thrilled
when they heard that Apple would be
coming to Gettysburg. "lam thrilled!"
exclaimed sophomore Jody Robertson.
When asked to describe Apple's mu¬

sic, Robertson replied, "She re
minds me of Tori Amos, though
their singing is not similar. I...just
like it."
Sophomore Juniper Day
agrees with Robertson and ex
picssed excitement about the im
minent concert. "She has a unique
sound," Day .said of Apple. Both
sophomore just got to know
Apple's music this summer.
Apple played with Lilith
Fan, the all-female lour conceived
by Sarah McLachlan. Other art
ists who performed with the Fan
include Mary Chapin Carpenter,
Tiacy Chapman, Sheiyl Crow,
Susanna Hoffs (of the Bangles), the
Indigo _Guls, Jewel, Lisa Locb,
Joan Osbouinc, and Su/anne Vega
Wilting songs and perfoim
mg "is something 1 think I've al
ways wanted to do," said Apple,
"but didn't say aloud--I wouldn't
admit it to myself, because admit
ting it meant making myscll vul
nciable to the possibility that it
might not happen, and that thought
was unbearable."

It wasn't until Apple felt that
making a move would be the nghl
thing to do that she moved to Los
Angeles to write That's when "I
decided the doois were open foi
me. It's not so much that this is
my destiny, but I made it my des
tiny—it's impossible to imagine life
not doing what you want to do."
Tidal was released in July
of 1996, and was produced by An
drew Slater, the manager of the
Wallflowers. Apple's first single,
"Shadowboxer," went Top Ten, and
she was then likened to "the high
priestess of soul" Nina Simonc,
and her song-writing was com
pared to that of Carol King.
Clearly this teenager will go far.

Jane pleases without
being obnoxious

byJonFr oehlich
Staff Writer
"G.I. Jane", starring Demi
Moore ("A Few Good Men,"
"Ghost") as Lt. O'Neil, and di
rected by Ridley Scott, is a movie
that attempts to comment on how
men and women arc constantly
being treated differently, both in
the US military and in society at
large. This movie not only tries to
tackle the above gender issues, but
also offers a fairly entertaining
story. After a shady political deal
between a female Senator and the
newly elected Secretary of the
Navy goes down, Lt. O'Neil be
comes a test subject in an experi
ment regarding the complete and
total integration of women into the
US Navy. But this proposal, along
with Lt. O'Neil's opportunity, are
simply for political show.
As part of this experiment,
O'Neil becomes the first woman

ever to be admitted to what is most
often considered the toughest mili
tary division in the world - the
Navy SEALS.
From this point on, "G.I.
Jane" takes on two distinct mis
sions. One is to tell the story of
Lt. O'Neil and attempt to give au
diences an accurate picture of
the Navy SEALS. The other, done
on a more subconscious level, is
to shed some light on attitudes to
wards gender in politics and the
military. "G.I. Jane's" message
about equality is an unavoidable
one simply because of the plot.
The more entertaining of
"G.I. Jane's" two missions, and
most likely the one that will draw

people to the theater, is the first
one. Because O'Neil is the only
woman in her class, she is natu
rally treated as the "new kid" and
scorned by many of her male crew
members. In the SEALS, O'Neil
finds only unequal treatment. Not
only is O'Neil frustrated by her
crew trying to make things more
difficult, she is also upset at how
the Navy tries to make things
easier on her relative to the men.
With these two forces work
ing against her, O'Neil seems
blocked at every turn by a defense
mechanism on the part of the Navy
to avoid embarrassment should
their plan back-fire. It doesn't take
long for her to realize that no one

expects, or wants, her to succeed.
But instead of giving up as every
one expects, O'Neil's determina
tion is immeasurably increased.
This turning point can be symbol
ized by what is perhaps the most
well known scene in which O'Neil
ceremonially shaves her head like
the rest of her crew.
From then on, "G.I. Jane"
progresses into what audiences
might predict - a proud story of a
woman finding the inner strength
and determination to overcome
both political and social obstacles
to infiltrate what was traditionally
a man's world. Where she once
found only closed minds and harsh
attitudes, she eventually uncovers
the kind of camaraderie that we all

crave. Though it may be difficult
for audiences to shake the cliche
"This is not a drill!," perhaps the
actual combat that the director
throws in at the end of this movie
is necessary to prove something.
In this movie, which involves a
woman who is constantly having
to prove herself, some actual per
formance in combat may be re
quired to put many of the issues
approached to rest.
"G.I. Jane" fits right in with
many of director Scott's other
films. Having directed films such
as "Alien" (starring Sigourney
Weaver) and "Thelma and Louise"
(starring Geena Davis and Susan
Sarandon), Scott seems partial to
using strong, and sometimes quite

masculine, heroines in leading
roles. Though "G.I. Jane" may not
have the heart stopping action of
"Alien" or the emotional suspense
of "Thelma and Louise," it does
avoid negative feminist stereo
types, and harbors a story line that,
while fairly predictable, will most
likely be satisfying to audiences.
With especially good perfor
mances by Morris Chestnut
("Boyz N the Hood," "The Last
Boy Scout") as a fellow crew
member and Viggo Mortenson
("Crimson Tide," "Witness") as the
ominous Master Chief in charge of
the recruits, "G.I. Jane" is a decent
movie that, while it may not make
you want to join the SEALS, will
make you respect all those who
have stood up against injustice to
defend their beliefs.

The Curtain Call
Exciting year planned for theater

The O&N, as many in the
theater like to call it, is formally
known as the Owl and Nightingale
Players. This is a student group
that, in conjunction with the the
ater department, is committed to
enhancing live art on campus.
The O&N performs fall,
winter, and spring productions
each year. The shows frequently
represent various styles and peri
ods. Shows have included dramas
such as Tennessee Williams' Cat
on a Hot Tin Roof (4/97), post
restoration comedies like Richard
Brinsley Sheridan's The Rivals (2/
97), classical Shakespeare such as
Macbeth (2/96), modern comedies
like Lee Blessing's Fortinbras (4/
96), musicals of the same ilk as
Kander and Ebb's Chicago (2/93)
and many others.

department

In addition, the O&N pro
vides opportunities for students to
be involved in student-directed
"lunchtimes" (fifteen minutes
scenes usually performed over the
lunch hour) and one-act plays.
The lunchtimes are directed
by the students in the Advanced
Directing class: Phil Anderson,
Glen Beck, Alec Beekmans,
Samantha Gregg, Brian Hershfeld,
Tim Johnsen, Jeremy Katz,
Duncan Niederer, Dan Novall,
Erica Strang, and Alexa Warren.
The lunchtimes beginning

on September 15 include such
scenes as, "The Jest of Hahalaba,"
"Street Scene," "Here We Are,"
"No Problem," "Graceland," "Me
Ow," "The Hat," and "Business
man." A student executive board
encourages and fosters involve
ment to promote the theater on
campus. This year's board is al
ready in the process of enacting
several changes that will give stu
dents who are interested in theater
more opportunities to become in
volved. Such changes include the
revival of the Theater Honor Soci
ety.

The student board lor this
year is Glen Beck (president), Tim
Johnsen, Alec Beekmans,
Samantha Gregg, and Megan
Manthey.
In theater news, the fall show

Roosters, by Milcha Sanchez
Scott, has been cast. The cast in
cludes Sam Gregg (Juana), Jenni
fer MacMurtie (Angela), Megan
Manthey (Chala), Dave Schoffner
(Hector), Paul Lapato (Adan), Rob
Thompson (Gallo), Jeremy Katz
(Abuclo), Alec Beekmans
(Zapata),- and Mary Cordero,
Michael Ferrer, Colleen Hubbard,
Jeffrey Jones, and James Kohn as
Shadows.
The production will be di
rected by Dr. George Muschamp
and assistant director Glen Beck.
The set designer is Jerry Hanson,
stage manager is Duncan Niederer,
and student technical director is
Jody Robertson. Dr. Muschamp
hopes to get the community in
volved with the production, so if
you have an interest in being in
volved with the production, please
don't hesitate to contact Dr.
Muschamp at the theater.

For the first time in recent
years, the O&N announces the full

year's season. Roosters is the fall
show, set to open Family Weekend
In the winter, the players will per
form Cotton Patch Gospel, a blue
grass musical similar toGodspell.
Finally, in the spring, the produc
tion will be Landford Wilson's Hot
L Baltimore.
The theater department is
also looking for anyone who is in
terested and able to play blue-grass
music (on drums, guitar, banjo,
etc.). Please contact Glen Beck or
Professor Emile Schmidt if inter
ested. This year promises to be a
particularly good year for theater,
so keep your eye on Brua Hall.
The first performances of the year
will be the lunchtimes, which open
on September 15. Look for more
information in future issues of the
Gettysburgian.

This column will run every
other week, alternating with a col

Students find ways to add spice and life to their rooms

Looking for ideas to liven up your room? Bored with your

byMelodieFoster
StaffWriter Do you ever walk down the
hall of your dorm, look at the other
rooms, and think "Gosh, why can't
my room look like that?" Well, fret
no more. You too can have a room
that will attract visitors, entertain
friends, and be comfortable to sit
around and do nothing in...oops..I
mean to study in.
What makes a room great?
Well, there are many factors: fur
niture, posters, rugs, and accesso
ries such as a TV, stereo, plants,
pictures, curtains, and art work.
How these things are used depends
entirely on the person, but a few
generalizations can be made. For
example, when you walk into a
room, you can immediately tell if
the occupants are male, female,
first-year, or upperclassmen.
There are huge differences
between girls' rooms and guys'

rooms. Girls rooms are cute,
comfy, homey. They are more
likely to put up curtains, match,
and hang aesthetically pleasing
posters; says one junior, "I'm not
afraid to hang up pictures of cute
animals."
Girls' beds have lots of pil
lows-the body pillow is popular
and stuffed animals. Their post
ers differ greatly from many in
guys' rooms. Posters that girls have
hanging often include sunsets,
little kids, animals, people kissing,
collages of photographs of friends.
In a guy's room, especially
if he has an apartment, one finds a
common theme: beer. Posters of
beer bottles, of beer cans, and
scantily clad women holding beer
are all over the walls. Lighted beer
signs, pyramids of cans, and win
dow displays of empty alcohol
bottles also add to the overall ef
fect.

Perhaps the most important
two items to have in a room are a
rug and a couch. Not only does a
rug protect bare feet from the cold
tile in the middle of winter, but a
rug can make a room look bigger
and more inviting.
A couch is a very good thing
if you have the space. Sophomore
Andrew Lee purchased a five-sec
tion white couch this summer from
a furniture barn for $ 139 because
"it was necessary for the sanctity
of the room." The mammoth
couch covers an entire corner, and
this makes Lee happy: "Now I
have my refrigerator, my TV, and
my couch all in one place; I'm
never going to move again."
A TV, though a big distrac
tion and excuse to procrastinate
("But Paity of Five is on—I'll start
my paper at ten, really"), brings a
little of the outside world into a
room. It can also be the focal point

stuff? Sick of your posters ? Look her el

of your room.
Junior Jay Henniger ar
ranged his room in Patrick last year
around his entertainment
centerwhich consisted of a big TV,
stereo, and big speakers. His room
was the home of hall football par
ties and viewings of movies such
as Independence Day that need a
big screen and big speakers with
lots of bass to do them justice.
The best things to have in a
room are interesting conversation
pieces that will draw people in
from the hallway, such a a big
couch, a crazy poster, a life size
cardboard cutout of Elvis (just ask
Marybeth Misluk), an odd chair,
or strange pieces of art.
Lisa Wingenroth, a sopho
more, brought with her this year a
plaster of Paris sculpture of a
dancer from a play put on in her
hometown. She commented laugh
ingly "it's a dancer; I couldn't let

them throw it out." The residents
of her floor hope to make the statue
a hall mascot, and plan to deco
rate him for holidays.
Where can you get all this
cool stuff? The Poster and Plant
sale sponsored by the College is a
good place to start. This year's sale
will be held next week. Yard sales,
attics, basements, and Wal-Mart
are all good places to find inexpen
sive, and often original decorations
and pieces of furniture. So get
motivated, get imaginative, and get
out there and start looking. There's
lots of great stuff to be found.

Dear Casey...

Dear Casey,
I need advice. I'm con
cerned about my friend. She
won't tell a guy who she's friends
with that she doesn't want to date
him. Meanwhile, she's interested
in a couple of other guys and is
thinking about asking one of
them out without telling Guy #1
that she "just wants to be
friends." I really don't care who
she dates, but I just don't want
her to get hurt. Please help.
A Confused Reader.
Dear Confused Reader,
This problem does not re
volve around whom your friend
likes, but whom she might not like:
herself. Everyone likes attention
and attraction, and of course it is
always an ego pat when someone
thinks you are special. It seems as
if your friend is enjoying this atten
tion too much to give it up. Hon
estly, though, who would want to
give it up?

men to dote on her.
Don't be fierce, but be hon
est and firm. Humans are not toys,
but they can be broken easily.
Dear Casey,
There's this guy I was re
ally good friends with last year
When I got here this semester, I
realized I liked him as moe than
a friend. I am really shy and
could never just tell him how I
feel. What do you think?
A Shy Heart
Dear Shy Heart,
One of the best things about
solid and healthy relationships is
that they re always changing and
taking different directions. And of
ten, good friendships with the op
posite sex have the possibility of be
coming strong "more than friends"
relationships. This will often take
time. It happened to me once, but
it took 12 years, and just happened
naturally.

I admire your concern about
her getting hurt in this situation,
but I personally would be more
concerned about the guy she is
leading on. People and emotions
should not be manipulated as ex
periments or as ego pats, and I
think you and your friend should
have a heart to heart about a few
issues—mainly respect. Respect for
this young man who has serious
feelings for her, and respect for
human emotions in general. But,
more than both of these, she should
have some respect for herself, and
not need to have an entourage of

I understand that you may
have qualms about losing him as a
friend by being direct, so take your
time, enjoy your friendship and let
things evolve naturally. All things
happen in due course. Who knows,
maybe you will find yourselves dis
cussing relationships over a cup of
coffee, and both of you will realize
that you would make a great pair.
But if that never comes to pass, en
joy having a friend of the opposite
sex. They are great for advice. Good
luck. If you have a question for
Casey, please write to Box 434.

Pachyderm's Pulpit

The summer is now over,
students are heading back to
school, family vacations are com
plete, the time to work has re
turned. According to most eco
nomic indicators as well as the
feeling in country there is plenty
of work out there. Unemployment
is down, the stock market, while
recently taking a slight plunge is
soaring, inflation and interest rates
are virtually non-existent. Not
only is the economy doing well,
but the budget is being balanced,
people are fleeing from the wel
fare rolls, and crime is falling, par
ticularly in our major cities. At the
most recent G-8 Summit of indus¬

trialized nations held in Denver,
Colorado President Clinton stood
atop his pedestal to explain how
his American model is so success
ful. The world must hope that the
President's fellow summiters do
not take his advice. Iftheydothen
they will have higher taxes, a bud
get in deficit, and a national pro
gram of socialized medicine. A
key reason that the United States
is doing so well is that Bill
Clinton's agenda was rejected.
Rejected by the Congress over
health-care and rejected by the
American people in 1994 when the
elected the first Republican Con
gress in 50 years.

Following that historic
rejection the President wisely
rolled over to the popular Repub
lican agenda of lower taxes, a bal-

by John Dunlap
anced budget, and welfare reform.
Rather than being the national
leader he rolled over and became
a "Me-too" President. The Repub
lican agenda worked during the
Reagan era, largest peacetime eco
nomic growth in our history, lower
crime, and yes we happened to win
the Cold War when some liberals
wanted us to retreat from the Com
munist threat. The Republican
Congress passed welfare reform
and after vetoing it twice, the
President finally signed it with the
1996 election approaching, when
the Republican Congress and the
Republican Presidential ticket of
Bob Dole and Jack Kemp called
for tax cuts, there was Bill Clinton
saying me-too. This summer af
ter fighting them for months de
spite taking credit for what the
Congress was doing, President
Clinton signed the first balanced
budget in a generation.

The most interesting as
pect of the balanced budget bill
was the Medicare provision. The
same medicare plan that Bob Dole
supported and Bill Clinton trashed.
Along with organized labor and
foreign campaigning cash, Bill
Clinton, said over and over that
Dole-Gingrich are cutting Medi
care. Well, Mr. President, Bob
Dole and Newt Gingrich were
right and you admitted that by
agreeing to their demands. It is a
shame that day and day out the
media is not pointing out the

President's hypocrisy, that only
shows their left-wing bias.
If President Clinton re
ally wants to know what makes our
nation so successful then he had
better sit down with Governor John
Engler ofMichigan who cut taxes
and balanced the budget, which
brought his state back from eco
nomic ruin. Or Governor Tommy
Thompson of Wisconsin who re
formed welfare in his state and
found that people do not starve, the
find work. He should also sit down
with Mayor Guilianni of New York
who showed leadership, took on
criminals and won. They are all
Republicans and they are carrying
out the Reagan agenda.
Now even devout liberals
are caving, while the rest of the
nation is growing, Maryland for
instance, with its liberal leadership
is staying behind.

President Clinton has be
come the Mikhail Gorbachev of
America. Like Gorbachev, the
President is watching his ideology,
liberalism, die. Die at the polls, in
the states, and in Congress. No one
can run on a liberal platform in
mainstream America. Mr. Clinton
had to move to the center and he
still only received 49% of the vote.
Just as Gorbachev made conces
sions to save Communism, our
making concessions to save big
government, but election by elec
tion the President is failing. That
is the American miracle.

Consider this . . .

A lot of attention has been
paid to this little paper over the past
two semesters. And with good rea-*
son. On the eve of our 100th an
niversary, we became the first
newspaper to print the tragic story
of our classmate Brian Peterson.
Our historic anniversary was
marked by parties and receptions.
We traveled up and down the East
Coast attending conferences where
we were recognized nationally.
We are currently contenders in the
"pulitzer prize of student journal
ism" --the Pacemaker Award.
Most importantly, the con
tent and coverage of the
Gettysburgian changed. Our staff
increased in size and we were able
to cover more campus events and
do so in a more complete fashion.
The design and layout be
came more reader-friendly and
modern.

But all these changes came
with growing pains.

We quickly outgrew the
computer system we had been us
ing for many years and after many
tribulations, we were able to pur
chase over $15,000 of the latest
newspaper computer technology.
New machines should make
everything new and improved,
right? Not so at the Gettysburgian.
Through a series of circumstance
beyond our control, including but
certainly not limited to the UPS/
Teamsters strike, we have been

unable to get everything up and
running as we had originally
hoped.
This sometimes disastrous
situation has led to obvious flaws
in recent issues that are far below
our normal standards.
We at the Gettysburgian sin
cerely apologize for the lax report
ing and poor design of our beloved
newspaper.
Please bear with us as we
work out the many problems that
have been plaguing our transition.
We will continue to bring
you the latest news, the most in
triguing commentary, the best Bul
lets sports coverage, and the best
coverage of campus entertainment
and features.
We will supplement our
usual coverage with a technology
section, themed features, and by
making our publication available
on our web site.

We have changed our adver
tising policy to increase revenue

ana _oe using -or--an
photography, layout, and informa
tion gathering techniques to bring
you increasing coverage of the
campus community.
In the coming weeks you
will no doubt notice substantial
improvements in the newspaper,
including a few surprises.
We look forward to a pro
ductive year filled with many more
adventures.
Thank you for your continu
ing support and patience.

Conflict and Consensus

Dear Editor:
on August 26, police found a dozen students passed out in a fraternity on the LSU campus. One, 20
year old Benjamin Wyyne, was already dead as the result of acute alcohol poisoning, three other students
were hospitalized.
Unfortunately, the behavior which led to Benjamin Wynne's death is far too common on our own
campus. Our March 1997 CORE Survey revealed that 67% of our students "binge drank" in the two weeks
before the survey. There is no reason, other than luck, which accounts for our not having experienced an on
campus alcohol related death in recent years, colleges around us (F&M, Dickinson, York) have not been as
fortunate.
Most of us know what alcohol does at high levels in our bloodstream. But it's not just the alcohol that
killed Benjamin Wynne. To protect ourselves, we often assume that bad things happen only to "bad" people.
But the fact is that tragedy can occur to any of us, "good" or "bad". Other factors in Benjamin's death were
the campus drinking culture, the way group dynamics influence individual choices and behavior, and inaccu
rate assumptions we make about "normal" college drinking.
I often hear students say that Gettysburg is a "safe" place to drink because drinking doesn't usually
involve driving. Bloomsburg University has lost seven students to alcohol-related deaths in the past five
years... none of these deaths involved cars. Gettysburg is not safer than Bloomsburg, F&M, Dickinson or
LSU. Let's all keep in mind that bad things do happen to good people and that we want to rely on more than
just luck to get us all through the year safely.

Sincerely,
Hariet Marritz

Women s Lax
makes EC AC bid

from Gettysburg Sports Release
A junior-dominated scoring
punch, aggressive defenders and
a stingy goalie added up to a suc
cessful 1997 campaign for the
Gettysburg College women's la
crosse team.
Head Coach Carol Daly's
squad concluded the season with
a 12-5 record. The Bullets fin
ished second behind Johns
Hopkins in the Centennial Con
ference and advanced to the East
ern Colleges Athletic Conference
(ECAC) Mid-Atlantic Champion
ships. A trio of juniors—Kim
Fritz, Leslie Marotz, and Chrissy
Nordhoff—accounted for more
than half of the Bullets' 193 goals
in 1997.

Fritz was the team leader in
both goals (47) and assists (13).
Marotz was a close runner-up in
the scoring department with 41
goals and nine assists. Nordhoff
furnished the Bullets with 32
goals and 11 assists.
With one season of eligibil
ity remaining, Marotz ranks
fourth in school history in career
goals with 125. Fritz and Marotz
are two of only six players in
school history to surpass 100
goals during their careers.
Another junior, Kris
Sullivan, was the Bullets' fourth
leading scorer in 1997. She had
21 goals and five assists to go
along with her team-leading 85
ground balls.
The only three seniors on

the Bullets' 1997 roster were key
contributors to the program's suc
cess. Goalie Carolyn Holmes
made 211 saves and allowed only
134 goals while playing every
minute of every game. She departs
Gettysburg as the career leader in
saves with 728.
Fritz and Marotz made the
all-region squad's first team at at
tack, while Sullivan was placed on
the first team's defensive unit.
Holmes was Gettysburg's fourth
all-region player.
Kate Mason was a solid per
former at both ends of the field and
was in the Bullets' starting lineup
37 times during her career.
Holmes and Mason were in
vited to play in the third annual
North/South All-Star women's la
crosse game on June 7 in Balti
more. Thirty-six of the sport's top
seniors, representing 30 different
Division III schools, were selected
to participate in the contest.

Four players were placed on
the 1997 Brine/Intercollegiate
Women's Lacrosse Coaches Asso
ciation Division III All-Central
Region team.
Fritz and Marotz made the
all-region squad's first team attack,
while Sullivan was placed on the
first team's defensive unit. Holmes
was the fourth all-region player.
Randi Ball had the best year
of her career as a senior, scoring
10 times and dishing out nine as
sists. Three freshmen—Kelli
Brennan, Sharon Coghan, and
BethFallon—started all 17 games

Men's Tennis Update

from Gettysburg Sports Release
Junior Brandon Cutter and
senior Justin Milne were the lead
ing players on the Gettysburg Col
lege men's tennis team.
Gettysburg posted a 10-4
overall record and was 5-3 in the
Centennial Conference, good for
fourth place.
Cutter, playing out of the
number one singles spot all year,
was 10-4 and was named to the
All-Centennial Conference first
team. He and Milne formed
Gettysburg's number one doubles
team, completing the year with a
10-4 record.

Milne was Gettysburg's
leading singles player with an 11 -
3 mark, going 9-2 at third singles
and 2-1 at second singles
Senior Justin Horn, playing
out of the number three singles
spot, posted a 10-4 record. He
matched that mark as a number
two doubles player, but he had
three different partners. His most
successful partner was sophomore
Chris Rippey. The tandem was
undefeated in six matches.
Rippey was 5-6 at number two
singles.
Gettysburg completed its
ninth season under Head Coach
Dave Wright. The Bullets are 84
30 under Wright's leadership.

Football is Life...
bySteveJenkins
Sports Editor
As the aromas of pork rinds,
charcoal grilled sides of beef, and
hot wings fill the air, America
knows that is is once again time
for another season of NFL and
College football. This Sund
marks the beginning of twenty
solid weeks of cheers, jeers and
testosterone levels that go through
the roof_.
Hey, what other sport can
you purchase tickets to see fat,
middle-aged, tattoo emblazoned,
and blatantly drunk fans root thier
team on to victory? (Okay, besides
WWF Monday night raw). Yes,
now that football is here all Ameri
cans will rejoice with remotes and
popcorn in hand as "The Pack,"
"The Birds," and "Americas
Team," all make their runs at a
Super Bowl Title. Is,

As a consummate fan of
football, I myself have constructed
a beginners approach to watching
and understanding the game.
Football is a game of execu
tion, speed, mental toughness, and
heart. Okay, I know what you are
thinking: "How smart do you have
to be? It is just a bunch of guys
smashing heads together. When
one team smashes more heads than
the other they win the game. How
hard can it be?"
Ah, there is much more be
hind the game than smashing and
punching. You sec each time the
big guys line up to block for the
smaller, faster guys, the coaches on
one team are trying to trick the
coaches on the other team. What
they do is called a "play."
Evcrytime the offense runs a play,
all the guys with one color shirt
have a specific assignment to block
the guys in the other colored shirts.
One player messes up, and the play
goes right down the tubes.

You see, the players who
have the ball arc trying to get past
the players without the ball in or
der to accumulate points. When
you see guys dancing, jumping
into the stands, and back-flipping
in Iront of the cameras, this usu-

Nothing else Matters
ally means the team with the ball
has gotten to the endline and has
augmented their scoie.
Aftei about thirty minutes,
the well conditioned athletes need
a break, so they head back to the
locker room for a rest. During this
intermission, the coaches are
calmly explaining to their players
why the opposing team is pound
ing them into oblivion, or
conversly, how to keep pounding
the opposing team.
If you arc watching at home,
you usually do not see this part of
the game. What you usually see
at halftime is four or five balding,
ex-NFL players trying to re-live
their usually ill-fated careers by
showing and analyzing highlights
from games shown all around the
country. All in all, watching these
guys is pretty fun, but the second
half is the part of the game that any
fan lives for.

When the second half be
gins, both teams have made the
appropriate changes and are ready
for another half of the elegant bal
let of dives, counters, receptions,
sacks, and pass-rushing. The fi
nal quarters tick away as every fan
sits on the edge of his or her seat,
waiting patiently for their team to
make its move.
If you are unfamiliar with
the game, do not be startled by the
empty beer bottles flying by your
head, or nachos protruding from
the mouth of the angry fan next to
you. Just know that this is the pin
nacle of dedication to a team. All

fans strive to reach this plateau, but
many often lall short in their quest.
When you sit down to take
in a game this Saturday or Sunday,
enjoy all that is going on around
you. Whether you are sitting in
you living room, or you actually
go to a game, it is important to un
derstand that football is not easy.
The game is played by hard-work
ing, focused athletes who deserve
some loyal fan support. So as you
stuff your face with pork rinds and
smear barbeque sauce all over your
face, just know that it is all for the
good of the game we know as loot
ball.

Women's Soccer looks to shoot down

Lady Bullet sophomores and
freshmen into a tight and cohesive
unit. The sophomore contingent
of Lady Bullets include Lauren
Scott, Maureen McBnen, Lauren
Frankford, Emily Brown, Laura
Zinck, Lauren Morrell, Traci
Bcigen, Stacey Elwood, Patsy
Cors, and Annie Pryor to name just
a few. The real test will be for this
particular group of girls. If these
ladies can work together and help
each other with the experiences
that each of them gained last year,
there is no telling what this squad
can accomplish.
During last year 's women's
soccer campaign, lack of confi
dence, experience, and injuries
riddled a season lilled with many
challenges. This season, with the
experienced team and 7 returning
starters, the team seems poised for

Leadership, heart, and ma
turity are the three qualities that
the Gettysburg women's soccer
team aie relying on this season.
With the loss of only four start
ers and many freshman seeing
time last season, the Lady Bul
lets are experienced and ready to
lead the charge to the Centennial
Conference Title.
Captain Beth O'Boylc
leads a group of women who had
somewhat of a lackluster season
last year, but are ready to pound
out the competition this season.
O'Boyle, along with fellow Se
niors Paula Connard, Robin
Kn/.a_, Knssy Doyle and Juniors
Sabnna Luciano and Shannon
Blair, are going to help mold the

greatness.
After a large turnout for pre
season camp, the roster has been
refined in order to establish a pow
erful lineup for this weekend's up
coming tournament. With games
scheduled for two regionally
ranked opponents, it is necessary
for the Bullets to "bring the noise"
in this weekend's games to find ou
what their squad can really accom
plish. "We have a great chance to
do well," said veteran Lauren
Frankford, "With the players that
we have back, and a talented fresh
man class, the whole team is very
optimistic."
This weekend's tournament
has the Lady Bullets playing host
to regionally ranked Cortland and
Mary Washington. Along with
Moravian, the Bullets will round
out the four team tourney.

Bullets ready to rock the house in 1997

byJoshEyler
Assisstant Sports Editor
As the leaves begin their
change, and Autumn shows signs
that he will soon be "bringin' in da
noise," the competitive football
season is just about to get under
way. Fresh off their annual Orange
and Blue game, the Bullet's grid
iron squad are looking forward to
a scrimmage this Friday night
when they travel to Reading, PA,
to take on Albright College, ranked
second in the nation in Division III.
The Orange and Blue game
was played this past Saturday and
was very successful, even includ¬

ing the fact that several key play
ers were sidelined due to injuries.
Sophomore defensive back Chris
"Sweet Lou" Lunardi said about
the game: "The defense was very
successful, but both sides of the
ball still need to improve. The of
fense showed that it has big play
potential, and hopefully can be
come more consistent. Overall, it
was a lot of fun to finally play in a
game situation and the whole team
is looking forward to scrimmaging
the number two team in the na
tion." This enthusiasm, undoubt
edly shared by all of Lunardi's
teammates, seems to be a trade
mark of the 1997 Bullets.

Predictions for this year's
finish in the Centennial Confer
ence range from sixth in national
publications to third in some local
newspapers.
A veteran packed defense
led by Kevin Gurski, Rob Sena,
Tom Olchon, and Chad Mire in the
backfield_, linebackers Joe
Hodakowski, Jason Osborn, Chris
Felton, and Brian Murphy, and a
stellar line anchored by Justin

"Killer" Domingos and Pete "Wild
Man" Scaffidi, both tackles, and
Scott Grabus and Gene Kraus
playing defensive end should
pound the opposing offenses into
submission this season.
Two questions still remain
ing in Bullet camp concern the of
fense. The first question revolves
around who will lead the offense
at quarterback. Will it be veteran
Chris Fugaro or sophomore
Weston Wells? The second ques
tion concerns who will fill the
empty spot at left guard. Vying

lor this position are Mike Lorge,
Steve Jenkins, and Kevin Cache.
Whoever wins this spot will
be surrounded by an experienced
offensive line that includes Bill
"The Animal" Beining, Bryan
Willard_, Kurt Ritter, and Justin
Ogorek. Junior Mike Holm and
freshman Nate Dahloff will com
plete the line as tight ends. In the
backfield, Paul "Schwarzenegger"
Smith, Matt Helwig, Don
McNellis, and Dan Sheats will all
see significant playing time. Se
nior Wayne Rumsey will return to
handle the kicking duties.

Sophomore Sensation Paul Smith (37) rumbles for yet another touchdown. Paul leads a tough
contingent of starters returning for the Bullets.

Already, in this early part of
the season, one can see that the
Bullets are hitting harder and are
lit with intensity. In the words of
senior linebacker and Bullet cap
tain Joe Hodakowski: "We have a
lot of experience back on both
sides of the ball. Little improve
ments in certain areas will turn
mistakes of last season into wins.
When you look at our schedule,
there is no team that we can't beat.
We had a great off season and ev
eryone is very optimistic." You get
the feeling that the guy is probably
right.

Cordova era comes to a close, but
Bullets stock up with young talent

from Gettysburg Sports Release

another school mark.

ting two triples in a single game.

son for the Gettysburg College
baseball team and, right in the
middle of the action was senior
outfielder Joe Cordova.

season with a 15-21 record and 10
8 Centennial Conference mark.
However, no less than nine school
records were either tied or broken.

belted 55 hits in 127 plate appear
ances. The 55 safeties breaks the
old mark of 53 for a single season.
Cordova led the team with 37 runs
scored, 32 runs batted in, 13
doubles, and 13 stolen bases. He
completes his collegiate career
with a .406 batting average, setting

record broken. Sophomore second
baseman Mike Wallo accounted
for 81 assists, breaking the old
mark of 69.
Five Gettysburg players
were named to the All-Centennial
Conference team. Cordova was
joined on the first team by senior
designated hitter Joe Trani.

Woods and Manzo and receiving
honorable mention was senior
pitcher Chris Volpe. Trani batted
.340 and drove in 20 runs. Volpe

with a 4-3 record, completing four
of the eight games he started. He
had 53 strike-outs and gave up 34
walks.
