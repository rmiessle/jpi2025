Staff Reporter Former US Senator, Senate
Majority Leader, and 1996 presi
dential candidate Bob Dole will
provide a free lecture open to the
public on Monday, April 13, at
7:30 pm in the CUB Ballroom.
Dole is the 1995 recipient
of the Eisenhower Leadership
Prize. The award was presented
to him by Gettysburg College and
its affiliate, the Eisenhower World
Affairs Institute in Washington,

D.C. The Eisenhower Leader
ship Prize is an annual award
which publicly recognizes a leader
who is influential in national and
international affairs and honors
a person whose lifetime accom
plishments reflect Dwight D.
Eisenhower's legacy of integrity
and leadership.
Other recipients include Lt.
Gen. Brent Showcroft, Gen.
Colin Powell, former Secretary of
the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen,
former US president George
Bush, and international human
rights advocate and Nobel Prize
laureate Elie Wiesel.
It is understood that all re
cipients of the award will even
tually come and speak at
Gettysburg.

Born in Russell, Kansas,
Dole has a distinguished carreer
of public service that spans'half a
century. Serving as a platoon
leader in the Tenth Mountain Di
vision in Italy, Dole was wounded
and decorated for his service in
combat in World War II. His
decorations include two Purple
Hearts and a Bronze Star with
Oak Leaf Cluster.

"GRAB" a chance at adventure
see page 6

He has had nearly unparal
leled experience in the American
political arena.
Dole has served as a county
attorney, a state legislator, Chair
man of the Republican Party, a
member of the House of Repre
sentatives, the Republican nomi
nee for Vice President, Chairman
of the Senate Finance Committee,
Senate Majority Leader, and a
candidate for President.
Dole retired from politics in
1996 after being defeated by Bill
Clinton in the Presidential Elec¬

tion. President Ronald Reagan
has said of Dole that "his title of
Leader is not just a job title, it's a
description of the man."
Dole's effectiveness as con
sensus-builder and his commit
ment to deficit reduction and eco
nomic growth have earned him
accolades from his peers — Re
publicans, Independents, and
Democrats alike.
Dole is currently married to
Elizabeth Hanford Dole, Presi
dent of the American Red Cross.
He has one daughter, Robin.
The plans for Dole's visit
were just finalized over Spring
Break. Dole will privately meet
with a group of several hundred
specially invited students on the
afternoon of April 13. Specially
invited students will also attend a
dinner with him. The public ad
dress will be given at 7:30 that
evening.

Dole's lecture is untitled as
of yet. It is expected that he will
speak on the world of federal poli
tics and federal government with
an emphasis on leadership.

Acclaimed short story writer to speak tonight

by Daniel Larkin
News _Editoi
Short story writer and
novelist Judy Bidnitz will read
from her writings tonight at the
Junction in the College Union
Building, at 8:00 p.m.
Bidnitz's debut collection
of short stories, Flying Leap,
met with much critical acclaim
when it debuted in January.
J.D. Biersdorfer, in The
New York Times Book Review,
writes: "Budnitz takes highly
imaginative leaps of faith and
logic in 23 stories about love,
despair, escape and hope. And
she doesn't look down."
Rachel Cusk of the Vil
lage Voice comments "Budnitz's
humorous and original story
ideas and the bold strokes with
which she delineates them are
the indispensable allies of her
lyric intelligence. They are
what makes Flying Leap an in
triguing and mature debut."
Newsweek says "There's

no filler and none of
those pretentious
stories about "real
life" where nothing
happens but we're
all supposed to pre
tend that something
did... Here is a col
lection that makes
good on the hype. .
. I don't know what
planet Budnitz
comes from, but I'm
happy to have her."
Kirkus Re
views calls it "Im
pressing by its au
dacity and original¬

ity ... Budnitz s j ucjy Budnitz will speak in the Junction tonight. f.i8photo
wry, conversational

tone is mcely leavened by pre
cise lyrical passages . . .
mordantl funny."
Compared with Margaret
Atwood, Paul Rudnick and
Shirely Jackson, Bidnintz tells
stories with a wide range of
topics. These include "Dog
Days," a tale of a man in a dog
suit in post-apocalyptic

America, "Got Spirit," about
cheerleaders so caught up in
school spirit that they set them
selves on fire for a football rally,
and "Guilt," a story of a son
convinced to donate his heart
to his dying mother.
Budnitz, 24, grew up in
Atlanta, and graduated magna
cum laude from Harvard. She

is now earning her Masters' de
gree from the NYU Creative
Writing Program.
In addition to her writ
ing, she is currently a cartoon
ist for the Village Voice, and has
drawn and produced an ani
mated film, "Hershel."
Budnitz's reading is spon
sored by the Writing House.

Women in black

by Libby Main
Staff Reporter On Monday, March
23, over two hundred
Gettysburg College Women
dressed in black to emphasize
the involvement of Greek
women in the campus commu
nity. Among the participants
were the former President of
Student Senate and Co-direc
tor of the Women's Center, the
Advertising Manager of the
Gettysburgian, the President of
the Art Society, the Chair of the
Student Alumni Association,
the Concert Mistress of the
College and Community Or
chestra, the Treasurer of the
College Democrats, the Vice
President of the Dance En
semble, the Secretary of Circle
K, the Choreographer and
Founder of the Indoor
Colorguard and the captains of
many sposall teams.
Greek women ac
tively participate in more than
sixty organizations on campus
including Allies, APO, Chapel
Choir, the Common Hour
Committee, the Commission
on the Future, Soccer, Softball,
Ministries at Christ Chapel,
SAC, Skeptical Chymists,

and the Pre-Med Society.
For many perspective
and first year students, a Greek
woman is the first Gettysburg
student they meet. This is be
cause this year, twenty-eight
Greek women have served as
Orientation Leaders, twenty
seven sorority women are cam
pus hosts, and twenty are tour

guides.
Last semester, the Greek
women's composite GPA was
3.043 while the non Greek
women's composite GPA was
2.939 and the all women's GPA
was 2.967.
The women dressed in
black to protest what they con¬

sider to be the prevailing atti
tude on campus, which is, that
Greek women are uninterested
in activities outside of their so
rorities. By doing so, Greek
women hoped to show that
they contribute a lot of time,
energy and leadership to many
aspects of Gettysburg College.

Take a GRAB at outdoor opportunities

by Erin Howe
Staff Reporter "You can learn more in
one hour of play than in a
whole day of conversation." -
Plato The Gettysburg Recre
ational Adventure Board
(GRAB) provides experiential
education opportunities to the
Gettysburg College campus
community. The overall mis
sion of GRAB is to provide an
environment which fosters per
sonal development and respect
for individual differences
through adventure-based ac
tivities, such as backpacking,
rock climbing, caving, and
leadership seminars. GRAB
creates an understanding of
safety procedures for trip suc
cess and recognizes that having
fun is still one of the top pri
orities. GRAB has sponsored
more than 25 trips this year.

In the past month alone,
there have been trips to North
Carolina, West Virginia, Vir
ginia, and Maryland. During
spring break, GRAB sponsored
a 63-mile backpacking trip to
the highest peak in Virginia,
Mt. Rogers.
First year student Kate
Welton described her experi
ence on the spring break trip
as "absolutely amazing" be
cause "you have the opportu
nity to do things you would
never think you would be able
to do, and can reach beyond

your own expectations in a re
ally positive atmosphere."
While the trip to Mt.
Rogers was lead by Paul
Hutchinson, Mark Rostafin_,
and Poppy Goforth, the new
GRAB facilitators went to Cold
Mountain, North Carolina,
where they experienced freez
ing temperatures, waist-high
snow, high winds, and torren
tial downpours during the Wil
derness Institute.
The Institute is an inten
sive week-long introduction to
trip and group facilitation.
Through workshops and dis¬

cussions during the training,
staff members get firsthand ex
perience in technical skills and
leadership development. The
staff is challenged on their per
sonal vs. professional facilita
tion styles, such as understand
ing gender and diversity issues.
Additionally, through spending
so much time together in this

numerous opportunities for students to participate.

kind of setting, the staff come
to rely on each other, and on
each other's judgement.
The second half of the
week was spent at Stone Moun
tain, North Carolina, where the
staff learned about rock-site
management, anchor and
rappel systems, and vertical
rock rescue techniques. Facili
tators concluded their week
with a 4-pitch, 675 ft. climb
and rappel on the face of the
rock. The week was a great
chance to strengthen leadership
skills and build group unity.
"Through these challenging
adventures and activities, we
benefitted from each other's
strengths and weaknesses as
individuals and as a whole

group," said first year facilita
tor Becca Sargent.
GRAB was developed and
created in the spring of 1996
by John Regentin, with the sup
port of President Haaland and
Dean Ramsey, recognized the
assets of what an experiential
education program could offer
the campus community.

GRAB is composed of 26
student facilitators who have
experience in a variety of out
door areas. All facilitators re
ceive training in backcountry
skills, wilderness medicine, and
expedition ethics by Regentin,
Alan Baker, and Dr. Gary
Nussbaum, Chair of the Leisure
Services Department at
Radford University.
The facilitators are also
dedicated to two central phi
losophies, the Full Value Con
tract and Challenge by Choice,
which emphasize the necessity
to uphold safety standards and
to respect yourself and the
group. Many Gettysburg stu
dents may have been exposed
to these two teachings while
participating in ropes course

activities. Essential to the func
tion of GRAB, these philoso
phies are necessary in that they
provide a framework for the
emotional and physical safety
of all the participants of any
GRAB sponsored activity and
therefore are never subject to
compromise.
The Full Value Contract

is the component of the GRAB
philosophy that allows both
participants and staff to get the
most out of their experience
and to define and achieve their
goals. The contract is an oral
or written statement guarantee
ing individual respect in a
group setting. Its purpose is to
stimulate each member to think
about their own role in the
group and to push themselves
to their own limits, while be
ing safe in the process.
While encouragement
from the Full Value Contract
allows groups to work together
and provide productive feed
back, the Challenge by Choice
element of the GRAB program
encourages participants to "try
potentially difficult and/or

frightening challenges in an at
mosphere of support and car
ing." In other words, anyone
has opportunity to back off and
say "I'm not sure I want to try
this," and their decision will be
supported by the group.
Casey Jaykus, who re
cently went on a caving trip,
appreciated the atmosphere
created by these philosophies.
"The staff was really support
ive and I didn't feel forced to
challenge myself more than I
wanted to."
Many students are intro
duced to GRAB through AS
CENT trips offered to first year
students. According to Welton,
the ASCENT trips "allow in
coming students a chance to get
to know other people even be
fore Orientation." Led by
GRAB facilitators, the trips ad
dress issues and questions
which concern incoming stu
dents about academic and so
cial expectations at Gettysburg
College.

GRAB also offers pro
grams for the communty. They
have a partnership with a Bal
timore high school, and some
of the male staff work with an
agency to start an adolescent
male involvement program.
As for the campus, GRAB
welcomes all students, staff,
and faculty to join them, re
gardless of experience level.
First year student Kate Cosseo
explains, "Outside, you can
learn more about yourself than
you could ever imagine."

Reel Hits & Misses

Marshals , Marshals , Marshals

by Dan Larkin and Mike Petro
Movie Columnists
Okay, how many people
out there didn't see The Fugi
tive? Well, those of you who
didn't see that classic summer
movie featuring Tommy Lee
Jones and Harrison Ford, you
are in for a surprise with U.S.
Marshals. For the millions of
you who did see the first install
ment, well, you won't be sur
prised by the premise of this
quasi-sequel.
The Fugitive was one of
the first of the classic TV-to-sil
ver screen films that swamped
the box office in the early nine
ties. It's also one of the best
(though with competition like
The Beverly Hillbillies and A
Very Brady Sequel . . . ). But
just when the glut of television
inspired movies seems to have
passed, we get this oddball.

Spinning the minor char
acters of a successful movie re
make of an old television show
into their own feature presen
tation may even be a first for
Hollywood, an attempt to lure
audiences on recognition ap
peal. "I've seen that before, it
must be good." (What's next,
Alice, the Bradys' maid in her
own feature film? )
Here goes. Picture a
man, Mark Sheridan, a former
CIA operative, framed for mur
der. He is arrested and placed
on a plane bound for a federal
penitentiary. The plane goes

through a spectacular crash
landing and Sheridan goes run
ning. Unfortunately for him,
U.S. Deputy Marshal Samuel
Gerard, a man with blood
hound instincts and the same
weathered looks (just kidding,
Tommy), is on his trail.
Sheridan, with the search
teams in hot pursuit must seek
to clear his name and get his
life back. Wesley Snipes
{Money Train, The Fan), plays
the hunted, Tommy Lee Jones
(Volcano, The Package) re
prises his Academy Award win
ning role, and they are joined
by the same supporting cast
members, the most notable be
ing Cosmo, played by the very
likeable Joe Pantoliano
(Congo, Calendar Girl).
The main appeal of The
Fugitive was the character of
Richard Kimball, played by
Harrison Ford. We believed in

his character, and wanted him
to escape. Snipes' portrayal of
Sheridan doesn't elicit the same
sort of sympathy that Ford did.
This is not due to Snipes' short
comings as an actor as much as
to the amount of screen time
that he is given. Where Ford
and Jones received equitable
amounts of screen time in The
Fugitive, U.S. Marshals is
clearly Jones' movie.
Jones does a respectable
job playing Gerard again, but
without the "Valjean -Javert"
style relationship of the origi
nal, his character is not as ex¬

citing . He won't be winning
any Oscars this time around.
The chemistry between
Jones and his fellow marshals,
however, is nicely portrayed
and probably the best part of
the movie. I'm sure they'll all
be back for another sequel in no
time. Maybe next time they'll
get to chase somebody who ac
tually did something wrong.
The team is joined by an
FBI counter-terrorist specialist,
John Royce, played by Robert
Downey, Jr. (Air America,
Heart and Souls) and proceeds
on a cross country search. You
don't need me to tell you all of
the near misses and deceptions
which twist the plot of this
movie, especially if you saw the
first.

Dustin Hoffman, in a re
cent interview, called Robert
Downey Jr., "the most gifted
actor of his generation." I'd be
more inclined to agree with him
if Downey didn't do stuff like
this. His character is never fully
developed and his performance
is rather uninspired. This is a
real waste of talent.
I was not overly im
pressed with this movie. It was
not as funny, nor engaging, as
its predecessor. However, I did
find myself enjoying the two
hours I spent with it. For the
enjoyability and the feeling of
a decent amusement park ride,
I give U.S. Marshals a three
stars. However, since the
weather is improving, your

money may be better spent go
ing to a real amusement park.
To me, U.S. Marshals was
more like watting in an amuse
ment park line. / mean, the
weather's nice, and at least
you're not at work, but get to
the good stuff already!
I've seen much, much
worse, but U.S. Marshals is
probably not a movie I'll re
member much about in a
month or so. Two and a half
stars (out of five).
And in a quick Oscar
redux, I'd like to say some
thing. Overall I was pleased
with the awards. Helen Hunt,

Movie Columnist
Of all the film genres, the
mob movie is one of the most
captivating. Since the birth of
the motion picture, gangsters
have been glorified. The mob
movie has evolved over time,
from the romanticized black
and white to the violent blood
bath of GoodFellas.
One of the most popular
and most quoted mob movies
of all time is GoodFellas. The
film was nominated for six
Academy Awards, including
Best Picture and Best Director
(Martin Scorsese).
The cast of GoodFellas is
a very talented one, starring
Ray Liotta (Eight Men Out;
Corrina, Corrina; Unlawful
Entry), Joe Pesci {Casino, My
Cousin Vinny), Robert DeNiro
(Wag the Dog), Paul Sorvino,
and Lorraine Bracco.
GoodFellas, like Casino
and Donnie Brasco, is based on
a true story. The movie itself

is based on the book Wiseguy
by Nicholas Pileggi.
GoodFellas begins right
in the middle of things. Henry
Hill (Liotta) takes the story
back to his childhood and his
dream of being a gangster. He
starts out as a run¬

ner for mobster
Paulie Cicero
(Sorvino), and
quickly moves up
the ranks. Even as
a kid, Henry be
comes very well re
spected and well
known, but be
cause he is only half
Sicilian, he could
never become a

"made man."
Henry, Tommy DeVito,
and Jimmy "the Gent" Conway
(DeNiro) are involved in rack
eteering, extortion, and hijack
ing. The movie follows
Henry's life in the mob from
errand boy to drug runner. Af
ter living the good life for a
while with wife Karen (Bracco),

lives of his wife and daughters,
Henry tells the feds what he
knows and Paulie and Jimmy
are sent to prison for their mob
crimes.
Joe Pesci's performance
as Tommy DeVito is unforget
tariis

Henry'_s world begins to fall
apart. Bracco, who received an
Academy Award nomination
for her performance, also nar
rates the story of Henry's life
in the mob.
Following the formula of

the mob movie, everything
comes to a climax after surveil
lance by the FBI. Henry faces
a long sentence if convicted on
narcotics charges. He also
stands the chance of being
killed by Paulie's men for his in
volvement with drugs, some
thing which was strictly prohib
ited. To save himself and the

most memorable line from Taxi
Driver. GoodFellas has even
been parodied in Steven
Spielberg's Animaniacs.
"Goodfeathers," a cartoon
sketch about three pigeon
wiseguys, draws largely on
GoodFellas, as well as on other
films in the genre.
Joe Pesci's performance

me, over-me
top character is
volatile and unpre
dictable. Pesci's fa
mous line "Funny
how? I'm a clown,
here to amuse you?"
is etched into film
history and is
quoted almost as
much as Robert
DeNiro's "Are you
talking to me?" the

h this movie is almost comi
cal, as he plays the melodra
matic wiseguy. Pesci received
the Best Supporting Actor Os
car in 1990 for his performance
as Tommy. DeNiro's soft-spo
ken, yet commanding presence
is among one of his greatest
performances. Although
Pesci's role as Nicky Santoro in
Casino, which also starred
DeNiro, is very similar to his
portrayal of Tommy, his role in
this film is much more likeable
and convincing.
GoodFellas is extremely
violent and explicit, but in or
der to tell the story properly,
these elements are necessary.
The use of flashback and sus
pended animation at pivotal
points are very effective tools
in telling the story. The voice
over done by Liotta and
Bracco's characters gives the
film a Wonder Years kind of fla
vor. The difference: Kevin and
Winnie are heavily into co
caine, and are now in the Wit
ness Protection Program.

Paper from here to the Pacific

GECO Columnist
By 2005, when it
reaches capacity, the Fresh
Kills Landfill on Staten Island
will be the tallest peak on the
East_/Doast between Maine
and Florida.
The U.S. recycles only
11% of its total waste com
pared to Japan, which recycles
50%. Sixty-five percent of our
trash goes to landfills, half of
which will close within five
years. U.S. businesses buy an
estimated 5 billion cubic feet
of polystyrene foam "pea
nuts" a year. That's enough
to fill the Empire State Build
ing more than 135 times.
! The U.S. produces 70%
of the world's solid waste.
Paper:
¦

It takes 390 gallons of
oil to produce one ton of pa
pier. That ton of paper, when
disposed of, takes up nearly
eight cubic feet of public land
fill space.
That public landfill is
approximately 36% waste
paper products.
Every one million pages
of paper not printed saves 85
pulp trees.
In prehistoric times,
60% of the earth's surface was

covered by forests; today, that
amount has been reduced by
30% and is still shrinking.
Paper and paperboard con
stitute 36% of the total amount
of solid waste produced.
Paper can be recycled
about four times before it loses
its tensile strength.

Making new paper,from
old paper uses up to 55_^K>iess
energy than making paper from
trees and creates much less air
and water pollution.
Every year, Americans
throw away enough office paper
to build a wall 12 feet high
stretching from LA to NYC.

If only 100,000 people
stopped their junk mail, we
could save about 150,000 trees
every year (and think of all the
junk mail we get!)
If we all recycled our
Sunday papers, we could save
over 500,000 trees each week.

months to rebuild our entire

Making cans from re
cycled aluminum cuts related
air pollution (for example, sul
fur dioxides which create acid

rain) by 95%.
It takes 19 times as much
energy to manufacture an alu
minum can from raw ore than
from recycled aluminum.
The average aluminum
can goes from the supermarket
shelf to scrap and back to the
shelf in 42 days.
The average American
uses about 42 lbs. of aluminum
each year, while the average
Chinese or Mexican uses less

Q: Is it too late to sign
up for an RPC?
A: Heck, no. It only takes
about 24 hour notice. You
should sign up in the blue book
on the reference desk in the li
brary—just give them 24 hours
between the time you fill out
the request and the time you
want the appointment.

to develop

research strat
egies for a paper or project.
Appointments may be
made between 10 a.m. and
noon, Monday-Thursday, and
between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m.
Monday-Friday. If none of
these times are convenient, spe
cial appointments may also be
arranged.
During the consultation,
the librarian will discuss strat¬

egies for finding the most rel
evant resources for your topic

clude, for example, how to use
subject and word searches in
MUSCAT to find books, how
to find materials in other librar

tain appropriate information
and how to use these efficiently,
how to discover if good topi

CONFLICT & Consensus

A plea for sanity

To the Editor:

ing that individual here, divide
the hosting responsibilities, and
share the marketing for the lec
ture. . For example, WSPAC, in
setting up its programming for
1998-99, sent a letter to all
departments and programs ask
ing whether they would be in
terested in cosponsoring speak
ers. Positive responses came
from three departments, and
next year's series (diminished
in size) will include at least two
cosponsored speakers.
3. If voluntary compli
ance is not effective, we might
think about reducing our bud-

As we are in the middle
of scheduling events for the
next year, I hear everyone
complaining about our fren
zied calendar of events. In an
effort to bring some sanity to
the scheduling process, let me
review the facts and then sug
gest some remedies.
The Facts:
1. Scheduling as it now
exists operates on free market
principles: as many events are
scheduled on one night as
space is available, and atten
dance occurs on a demand ha-

S1S. 2. This year, at least four
groups which strive to educate
the entire campus community
about other cultures scheduled
events against each other: the
Senior Scholars' Seminar, the
Intercultural Resource Center,
the International Students, and
the Area Studies Symposium.
Many other major conflicts
occurred as well.,
3. We have chosen not
to exert any control over
scheduling; no advice is of
fered as to possible conflicts
which may occur. This laissez
faire approach is exacerbated
by the use of Gopher for
scheduling purposes. It is now
possible to find out whether a
particular space is available on
a particular evening and to just
ignore what else is going on
that night. It is also possible
to check the campus schedule
by date , but some would per
haps prefer not to know.
_> * r
\\F a i,
tt
_t

have little money available to
bring in lecturers and perform
ing artists.
5. Moreover,-something
like a turf battle seems to have
erupted between certain pro
grams and departments. If a
series already exists in conjunc
tion with one program, then it
seems that each must mount a
spate of lectures or an addi
tional series in an effort to
prove competitive.
6. Despite the fact that a
large portion of tuition money
is expended on speakers and
performances, most students
do not attend these events un
less they are required in con
junction with a class. Many
professors hesitate to require
students to attend events out
side of class, either because
they themselves do not live
nearby and cannot attend, or
because they are reluctant to
require peripheral intellectual
experiences.

7. We may have confused
the student cry "there isn't
enough to do at Gettysburg"
with the need to pour money
into our Lecture and Perform
ing Arts budget ant to sched
ule more and more events. (Ad
mittedly a conjecture rather
than a fact.)
Possible Remedies:
1. Every group which
sponsors a series of lectures or
performing arts might think
about reducing the number of
such events. All of us are
stretched too thin} Next year's
Area Studies Symposium, for
instance, will offer fewer pre
sentations than in past years.
The topics will be provocative
ones, however, dealing with
controversial issues in Latin
America.

4. We have created
Common Hour to bring the
campus community together in
a mutual intellectual experi
ence, but we have not dimin
ished the amount of evening
programs which are being
funded. Very few. programs
are well attended, even Com
mon Hour, which includes that
rarity, a free lunch. The "Com
mon Hour Effect" occurs natu
rally on those _campuses that
,
F s r r r r

2. Co-sponsorship may
be one way to encourage larger
attendance at lectures. Thus,
two _' ciepartments or groups
would mutually agree on a
speaker, share the cost of bring-

gets for such programming in
future years. In their place, we
might set up a Faculty Presen
tation Series in which certain
individual faculty members or
departmental teams did presen
tations on such offbeat topics
as their own research, film criti
cism, or politics and world af
fairs. The Socratic Club is a
great student venue for student
debate and needs to be encour
aged. In other words, we need
to stimulate each other and
model for each other the pro
cess of making sense of the
world in which we find our
seives.

4. Of course, we have no
intention of cutting ourselves
off from that world or of ceas
ing to bring new ideas and per
forming techniques onto our
campus from other places.
However, we might try to cul
tivate an attitude of what the
Buddhists call "mindfulness" in
our- scheduling. Such an atti
tude would require that every
individual, every program, ev
ery department commit them
selves to considering carefully
what else is scheduled and
whether it would be a thought
less gesture program a signifi
cant event against some other
program of similar content. We

Consider this

Three hundred people
have spoken, and they want a
dance club.
Last Friday night, the So
cial Life Committee sponsored
a BYOB Video Dance Party in
the CUB Ballroom.
Poor attendance has often
plagued such events, and the
party did start out slowly with
only a handful of people mill
ing around the Ballroom, per
haps due to the fact that stu
dents were mesmerized by co
median Alonzo Bodden. After
his show ended around 11 p.m.,
the Ballroom quickly filled up
with dancers.
The video dance party of
fered dancers the opportunity
to request songs, and although
some choices, such as ABBA's
"Dancing Queen," were ques
tionable, even the security
guards could be seen occasion
ally mouthing the words to
songs.

This one-time event was
a success, but does that imply
that a permanent dance club is
a feasible option for Gettysburg
College? Will the novelty of a
dance club wear off? Will atten
dance decline as time goes on,
or during Rush or other special
events?

The success of college
sponsored social events in the
past varies with the event. En
thusiasm is currently high for a
dance club, but many activities
and events look good on paper.
A one-time turnout does not
guarantee success in the future.
The target _audience for
the dance club is likely to be first
year students, possibly as a
means of discouraging them
from attending fraternity par
ties. However, students will be
required to be 18 years of age
in order to enter. Some first
year students have not turned
18 by the time they enter col
lege. Is it fair to bar thern from
campus events?
What to do about this di
lemma?

Before finalizing any

school should consider sinking
a lot of money into a dance club.

CONFLICT & Consensus
The Pachyderm y s Pulpit

Maryland republicans? If spossible.

by John Dunlap
Political Columnist
A few miles to our south,
as we all know, stands the state
of Maryland, one of the most
Democratic states in the coun
try. For 30 years Democrats
have controlled the state's Gov
ernorship and for over 65 years
the state General Assembly. In
1992, with the exception of
Arkansas, Maryland gave then
Governor Clinton his biggest
majority in his election as Presi
dent. In recent history, only
President Ronald Reagan in

1984, and President George
Bush in 1988 were able to
break the Democratic hold 1 on
the state.
Today things are chang
ing in the Old Line State, as the
Republican Party is finally be
ing competitive. For years, the
GOP was a carbon copy of the
Democrats in the state. Repub
lican candidates tended to be
very liberal and many times
from Washington, DC, not
Maryland. Individuals like
Reagan Aide Linda Chaves ran
for office, not native Maryland-

ers. Democratic leaders were
usually firmly based in the
greater Baltimore area. That
too is changing. The state's
largest counties are Montgom
ery and Prince George's Coun
ties. Both sit right outside
Washington. These people do
not read the Baltimore Sun or
watch Baltimore television, but
instead read the Washington
Post and get their news from
the nation's capital.
In 1994 for the first time
in over a hundred years, some
one from the Washington sub
urbs, Prince George's County
executive Parris Glendening
was elected Governor.
Now the GOP has cre
ated a farm team and is creat
ing a statewide network to win
elections. Four of the eight
members of the Maryland del
egation to the United States
House of Representatives are

Republicans and GOP numbers
in the General Assembly are
rising. Republicans hold 41 of
141 state House of Delegates
seats and 15 of 47 State Senate
seats. This means that Repub
licans are building a base and
the party is doing this by mov
ing to the right. No longer are
Maryland Republicans "Want
to be" Democrats, but they
now stand for a conservative

set of principles.
The 1994
midterm election
was

a watershed year for Maryland
Republicans. First, the minor
ity leader of the House of Del
egates, Ellen Sauerbrey of Bal
timore County shocked the
state's political establishment
by defeating the party's pre
sumptive nominee United
States Congresswoman Helen
Bentley. Mrs. Sauerbrey's vic
tory was a win for the Repub
lican right. Sauerbrey is a con
servative Republican who
based her campaign on her pro
posed 24% state income tax cut
as well as holding the line on
future government spending.
Sauerbrey attacked Mrs.
Bentley for being too cozy with
Democrats, such as Governor
William Donald Schaiffer,
whom Sauerbrey had battled in

the legislature. By a margin of beat the Governor and make
52% to 38% Sauerbrey de- major gains in the General
feated the Congresswoman. In Assembly in 1998. Even with
the general election, Mr. the economy growing and
Glendening attacked Sauerbrey crime dropping, Parris

Republicans for the first time

would take the Governor's
Mansion. On election night,
the race was to close to call, and
with the counting of the absen

one fundraising edge came in
handy as he was elected Gov
ernor by two-tenths of a per
cent. His victory was marred
by accusations of fraud in Bal
timore City. Sauerbrey even
took the election to court but
her case was denied.
Today however, many of
Sauerbrey's accusations of
fraud are being confirmed. In
the past four years the
Maryland GOP has continued
to grow in numbers. Republi

' _™ sions testing and
state funding of football
stadiums have hurt the
governor.
Governor Glendening is
facing trouble within his own
party as he has trouble keep
ing Democrats together. Hart
ford County Executive Eileen
Rehrman is giving the governor
a strong challenge within his

own primary.
Retired Washington
Redskins football player Ray
Schoenke is also taking on the
governor. If the governor can
make it through the primary,
then he must defeat Mrs.
Sauerbrey again. Unlike four
years ago, today Sauerbrey has
high name recognition, a great
deal more cash, and has been
campaigning virtually non-stop
for governor for the last three
years. She has also softened her
image talking more about edu
cation, something she knows a
lot about considering she was
a biology teacher in Baltimore
County.
The issues that Sauerbrey
is concentrating on are the
economy, education and ethics.
She promises to bust up the
"cozy clique" who run Annapo
lis and to stop runaway state
spending. Howard County

Executive Charles Ecker is tak
ing on Sauerbrey in the Repub
lican primary, accusing her of
being overly conservative. This
does not appear to be working
as Sauerbrey is far ahead in the
polls and has the state GOP vir
tually united behind her.
National GOP figures are
rushing into Maryland to help
out her campaign like Gover
nors Tommy Thompson of
Wisconsin, John Engler of
Michigan and Terry Branstand
of Iowa. Former Governor
William Weld of Massachusetts
and Governor Christie
Whitman of New Jersey, both
moderates have paid visits.
Former Vice President Dan
Quayle, the 1996 Republican
Nominee for Vice President
Jack Kemp and Congressman
John Kasich all have helped
Sauerbrey raise money.
A recent visit by retired
Marine Lieutenant Colonel and

the 1994 Republican Candi
date for the United States Sen
ate from Virginia, Oliver
North, caused controversy as
both Democrats and Republi
cans attacked Sauerbrey for in
viting the very conservative Mr.
North.
The balancing act that
Ellen Sauerbrey must perform
is difficult. The Maryland Re
publican Party has one of the
most liberal members of Con
gress, Connie Morrella, and
one of the most conservative
members of Congress, Roscoe
Bartlett, in its leadership. It is
up to Sauerbrey to hold them
together and win enough
Democrats in this overwhelm
ingly Democratic state to be
come governor. With Parris
Glendening's unpopularity and
a divided Democratic Party
than this could be the year.

The election of a Repub
lican governor in 1998 can fur
ther strengthen the national Re
publican party by making one
more state competitive; never
again will Republicans have to
concede Maryland just because
it is Maryland.

Sanity

reporters be more concerned
with gaining American atten
tion and interest in their coun
try rather than what our presi
dent is doing behind closed
doors? The African country,
Ghana was extremely excited
to host Mr. Clinton. He spoke
before a very large, enthusias
tic crowd. In his speech he
stated, "Democracy requires
human rights for everyone, ev
erywhere. For men and
women, for children and the
elderly, for people of different
cultures and tribes and back
grounds. A good society hon
ors its entire family."
President Clinton is ex
cited about promoting free
markets and democracy and
aiding the African people, who
are in need. However, my con
cern is, why aren't the efforts
being made to make America
better?

by Cammie Grant
Columnist

President Clinton is on a
twelve day tour of Africa. He
is there to assure Africans aid
and attention from the United
States and he is speaking out in
support of democracy and free
markets.
Prior to beginning his
journey, to Africa, some specu
lated that the president was
leaving the country to avoid the
Lewinsky controversy. The trip
to Africa has been planned for
at least a year. It is a coinci
dence that the trip and the in
vestigation are occurring at the
same time. There is no reason,
unless the president was called
to testify in court, that the Af
rica trip should be canceled.
James Bennet, The New
York Times wrote, "This trip
has come at a propitious time
for Mr. Clinton, who is under
pressure at home from the in
dependent counsel investigat
ing his relationship with
Monica S. Lewinsky". But it
was clear that the President

would not escape his troubles
in Africa. The Times stated that
"Ghanaian reporters grilled
their American colleagues
about details of the crisis"
Once again, it is sad to see
that other countries are aware
of President Clinton's lack of
morals. A few weeks ago,
Saddam Hussein was running
clips of Wag the Dog in addi
tion to airing Clinton's Cabi
net members being shouted off
stage in Ohio. Now, the Gha
naians are questioning Ameri
cans about Clinton's alleged
affair. Shouldn't the Ghanaian

Thousands of American
citizens claim their homes on
city streets under bridges; jails
are filled to capacity; the bud
get suffers; when is the execu
tive office going to focus its
undivided attention on our
country's problems, before ad
dressing problems in other
countries and giving aid?
I am proud of the United
States. I take tremendous pride
in our government and its
structure. It is, however, an
embarrassment to read in
magazines and newspapers that
foreign countries are aware of
Clinton's personalcn ' s/s and
even more so, want to report
on it. I do, however give ku
dos to Clinton's foreign policy
efforts.

These people
bring their pets. __
outside for a walk across^^
campus. Of course their dogs
don't seem to need leashes.
And it doesn't matter if the
dogs run beyond their owner's
immediate reach, after all they
are perfectly behaved.

You should keep your dog
on a leash when you take them
out for a walk. They are ani
mals and like any animal can
not always be predicted. I'm
not saying that unless we put
all those dogs on leashes their
WILL be an attack. But
stranger things have happened.
On a more considerate level be
considerate of people who may
not like dogs or even be afraid
of them.
One night as I was walk
ing back to my room a dalma
tian that was off its leash took
off from its owner towards me.
I've lived with dogs my entire
life and could tell that this one
was just being friendly. What

if in my place you put some
one who does not know what
this animal is doing or how to
react to it?

spirit of the liberal arts tradi

learned from programming in
some other area of interest than
our own, and that we should
not deny that opportunity to
others on campus.
I do not believe that we
have to stand helpless before
the "scheduling frenzy" that
seems to have overtaken us

Schmucker or across the Tiber
and you will see what I mean.
These owners do not care if

Random
thoughts

Free floating hostility

by Sara Sprenkle
Random Thinker
It's a small campus.
Duh.
What that means,
though, is that when you speak
loudly of a person, someone
nearby could be his or her
friend/roommate/signif leant
other. On Monday night, I was
at Servo, minding my own busi
ness, when I heard a certain
female speak of one of my
friends and call her a not-so
nice name. She didn't seem to
care who heard her, or maybe
she was ignorant of the fact that
one of her verbal victim's
friends might hear. So, I guess
I was within my right to tell her
that I thought she was out of

ne. I feel bad that I didn't
defend my friend because what
the verbal assaulter said was
totally not true, but I felt out
of line since I didn't know the
girl or anyone she was talking
to. The point is remember
the next time you complain
about (your TA/a classmate/a
person down the hall) someone
nearby may overhear you and
take issue with what you said
about his or her friend.
Now I'm in a bind. I
want to write about another
rude person, but that doesn't
seem very random. Oh, wait, I
thought of something else be
fore I write about that.
The snooze button is ev
ery college student's friend.
Every alarm clock I have had
has an alarm that goes off seven
minutes after the snooze but
ton was hit.

Why seven minutes? Was
there some study done that
found that seven minutes is the
optimal time for someone to
wake up after a first warning
alarm? Just wondering. I'm not
saying there wasn't. If anyone
knows, send a letter to the edi
tor, Box 434.

I like cherry flavored
stuff, but I don't like cherries.
I know other people who like
some flavor, but they don't like
the real thing, so I'm not that
weird.
Anyway, back to the rude
guy... My friends and I went to
Myrtle Beach over Spring
Break, and we went to the
Hard Rock Cafe.
I ordered The Pig sand
wich because the menu says
that I haven't been to the Hard
Rock Cafe until I've had that.
I have been at the Hard Rock
Cafe in New York before, so if
I wanted to tell people I had
been there, I had to get the
sandwich.
The waiter took my order
as an invitation to mock me.

When he brought the
meal, he asked, "Who is the
barbecue chicken?" Then, he
asked, "Who's the pig?" I re
luctantly answered-fodder for
the fire.
After that, the waiter
would stop by and comment on
how quickly I ate my food and
how much of my food I ate. He
did not do this once or twice—
he did this every time he
stopped to check for refills, to
ask how our meals were, to
pick up our plates, to get a
desert order. Every time.
I don't know why the
waiter thought that this was a
good way to score tips. It
seems that my tablemates
found this amusing, but I was
not amused.
The guy ended up with
over a 20% tip, under my pro
test. My tip suggestion was 94
cents. However, it seems that
my tablemates thought other¬

. I understand that some
restaurants have some strange
service philosophy with pur
posely rude waiters, but Hard
Rock isn't one of them. Like
improvisation in rock and roll,
an impromptu waiter is some
times good but not always.

Opinionated Editor
Okay Gettyburgian fans,
given the fact that I was aban
doned by a couple of my writ
ers this week, you're all in for
a special treat. As editor, I am
usually consigned to reading
what others write. However,
today I trade in that hat

to become a writer
Actually, I have
traded in nothing,
rather, I am pull
ing double duty
tonight!
As a re
sult, I give to _JF
all the loyal _jdj
readers out 5_^
there a «_2
written _^Cm
contnbu- _^JJ
t i o n .
However, if
you are a
glass is half full
person, I highly
reccomend that
you stop read
ing this
right now.
Tak¬

ing
theme from the
comedic

,
George Carhn, I offer to the
readership something known as
"free floating hostility." Enjoy
Kids and guns. I know
that our violence prone society
has desensitized many of us to
violence, but surely there must
be many out there that share
my abhoration at the shootings
which took place in a small
Arkansas town. How is it that
we have denegrated as a soci
ety so much that two thirteen
and eleven year old kids can
shoot fourteen classmates and
a teacher?
¦ There are apologists out
there that would be inclined to
think that it is just the actions
of mentally unstable and impul
sively immature kids, however,
where the hell did a thirteen

and eleven year old get a veri
table arsenal of weapons?! Not
only should these kids be pros
ecuted to the full extent of the
law, but those who had the
weapons within reach should
be brought up on a few hun
dred charges of endangering
the welfare of a child, one for

each student at that school.
Okay, enough of sound
ing like a real right winger.
Moving on. Turn signals. Vir
tually all of the readers of this
publication are drivers. When
is it that people stopped using
turn signals? There is a reason
that the law requires that ev
ery car has them, so people
know where a car is going! Has
it become so difficult to move
that little lever up and down?
Please, for everyone's benefit,
use your damn turn signals!
' The media. When did we
become' a 'society of scandals?
Ever since Watergate, every
hack with a tape recorder and
a camera crew is trying to be
come the next Woodward-and
Bersteui. Why is it that Bill
Clinton is off in Africa and the

main story CNN runs is that a
reporter asked him about the
allegations? Who the hell
cares? Personally I take an inter
est in our foreign policy, and
making headway in Africa is
much more important than
some contrived scandal. I don't
give a damn who he slept
with! If he co¬

erced people
to lie, im
peach him,
otherwise
leave it
i alone!
i Re
I sponsibil
|_ ity. Why
P_^ 1 is it that
it seems
as if ev
eryone al
ways has
an excuse?
If you make
_t a mistake,
P own up to it.
If you make a
commitment
to someone,
follow through
on it. There
used to be a thing
called honor. A
person word

_^^B s was
_^^_B seen as a bond.
Where did those days go?
I'd be a lot more forgiving if
people would just own up to
their faults.
Finally, let me say a few
things about complacency.
Don't people care anymore.
Why is it that it takes someone
Greek bashing to bring a letter
to the editor to this paper?
What ever happened to people
climbing on a soapbox and tell
ing others what they think.
People, it is okay to get angry,
it is okay to voice your opin
ions! It doesn't take long, and
trust me, it can be rather
therepeutic. So I challenge all
of you opinionated people out
there to sound off at the top of
your lungs. Maybe if more of
us did this, less people would
feel the urge to blow fellow
human beings away.

More than just a prejudice, Rutstein
suggests that racism is a form of
prejudice that has evolved into an
obsessive psychological disorder that
deeply affects perpetrator and target
alike. Hailed as "a brutally honest
portrayal of racism that offers a
solution and does not leave us with
hopelessness", Rutstein's book
"Racism: Unraveling die Fear" was

much of his adult life. His personal
experience of the holocaust has led him to use

You may recommend yourself or someone
else. This would be an April, Sept.-Nov.

The NCAA Men's
by Steve Jenkins
Sports Editor
It is March again, and
nobody cares about coming in
like a lion or that stupid lamb.
Any sports fan with a heartbeat
knows what has been going on
for the last two weeks. In
jected with passion, feeling,
and the way sports were meant
to be, March marked the be
ginning of the NCAA Division
I Basketball tournament; oth
erwise known as March Mad¬

ness. Why is it called March
Madness you ask? What is so
mad about it? Well, March is
the time of year when the
NCAA brings the 64 best bas
ketball teams in the country
together for one big, rip-roar
ing clash of the most intense
gritty, powerful, and exciting
basketball in the world.
" "But I like the NBA," you
say. "I just go watch the Wash
ington Wizards." Yeah. The
Wizards are a good team to7

Basketball Tournament has been whittled down to four teams. Who will overcome?

homeruns, 80 yard runs, and
power play goals; rather, they
are supposed to mean some
thing. Sports are great because
of the way you feel when your
team loses, or when you see
guys like Christian Laettner hit
a 20 footer with .2 seconds on
the clock. The emotion is the
reason we love sports.
"The Tournament,"
which started with 64 teams
has now been whittled down to
four. Sixty teams are now at
home thinking of the season
that could have been. With all
the heart in the world, and the
NCAA championship on the
minds of the four remaining
teams (North Carolina, Ken
tucky, Utah, and Stanford),
emotions will be running high,
and some hearts will be sink
ing low. But what you will see
is guys diving for balls, sweat
ing, bleeding and crying to
gether, and playing sports how
they should be played- not for
the money...for the love.

Pump the B.A.S.S

This group of guys keeps the spirit of our campus up

by Ben Wolf
Contributing Reporter
The B.A.S.S. (Bullet Ath
letic Support Squad) house is a
special interest group whose
goal is to build team support
on campus and in the commu
nity for Gettysburg College
teams. Since each member has
been a collegiate athlete here,
it was obvious that there was
something lacking at most
sporting events spirit.
They felt that there was
a pessimistic and uninterested
attitude towards many sports.
This was brought to their at-

Members

tention with evidence of poor
attendance and very little en
thusiasm at the games.
Viewing this over and
over again, the group decided
to make it their goal to change
the campus's athletic spirit by
forming a special interest
house. Through forming this
team, the group aimed to make
changes in the community and
the campus to reverse the un
enthusiastic athletic attitude.
Working through the special
interest program format, the

house created several "pro
grams" which hoped to draw
attention to the sporting events
on campus.
Some of the programs
that the house has initiated
over the past academic year
include: a homecoming ban
ner contest, the singing of the
national anthem at many home
events; the posting of Gettys
burg College athletic calendars
throughout the community and
on campus; the mailing of fli
ers; and a series of articles in
the Gettysburgian (like this

photo by fcmiiy _Ulatielter
If school spirit is what you are all about, then BASS may be the group to follow.

one), which highlight different
athletes and teams.
As for the individual
members of B.A.S.S., each feels
that he is working towards a
goal that will benefit his col¬

lege. House member Chris and it definitely has enhanced
Bowman adds, "This college their experiences here at Get
supports many successful ath- tysburg College_,
letic teams that win champion- Although B.A.S.S. recog-

ships, and we feel that it is nec
essary to recognize and support
their efforts. Our athletic pro
grams continue to grow, and we
feel that it is time for the stu
dent body to support the ef
forts of their peers."
Everyone in the house
shares these sentiments and
contributes something valuable
to the team. Also, the house
feels that working and living
together has greatly enhanced
the friendships that previously
existed among its members and
advisor (Kelly Jones). The
house says, "We love you
Kelly!"
The group credits their
personal growth and program
successes directly to the special
interest program of Gettysburg
College. The college has pro
vided them with a very unique
and interesting opportunity,

nizes that some progress has
been made toward achieving
their ultimate goal, they feel
that much more needs to be
accomplished. B.A.S.S. will
have another opportunity to
build on what they have
started, because they have been
granted the special interest
house again for the upcoming
year. You can be sure to see
some upcoming programs com
ing from this group. They plan
to continue their current pro
grams, and hope to create even
better ones for the future.
Some of the ideas being con
sidered include a sand volley
ball tournament, making T
shirts, a cannon for outdoor
home games, and much more.
B.A.S.S. looks forward to
the continued support of the
campus and would like to
thank everyone who has con-

Woods and Co. splits with Mules

by Ronnie Beeman
Staff Reporter The Gettysburg Bullets
baseball team opened up their
Centennial Conference season
Wednesday with a spilt against
Muhlenburg College.
In the first game, the
Bullet's won 4-3. Paul Koether
pitched a complete game to
pick up his fourth win of the
season. Koether fanned four
and walked one in seven in
nings of work.
The offensive and defen
sive star of the day was Bill
Neston. In the top of the sixth,
with a runner on second,
Neston made a spectacular
catch in the right-center field
gap to prevent Muhlenburg
from taking the lead.
In the bottom half of the
sixth inning, Drew Lavenburg
led the inning off with a
double.

Chris "Sweet Lou
Lunardi followed with a sacn

fice bunt to move Lavenburg to
third, setting the stage for
Neston. Once again Neston
was up to the challenge. He
plated Lavenburg, the game
winning run, with a sacrifice
fl y; "In the second
game, the ball just
didn't bounce our

way. We can
come back."
In the second game of the
double header the Bullet's eight
game winning streak came to
an end with an 8-6 defeat to
Muhlenburg. The Mules took
advantage of several Bullet mis
takes to exploded for six runs
in the fifth inning. Freshman
Tom Boob(l-l) suffered his
first varsity loss.
The Bullets did not go
down quietly. After scoring a
run in the fifth, the Bullets

made a charge in the seventh.
Kevin Grimm hit a triple
with one out. John Woods
grounded to shortstop to score
Grimm. Bill Beining walked
but was left stranded as the
game ended.
Daryl Clancy, Bill
Neston, Kevin Grimm, and
John Woods each had two hits
a piece.
"The first game we
played well," said designated
hitter Bill Beining. "In the sec
ond game, the ball just didn't
bounce our way. We can come
back." The Bullets look forward
to an away game Thursday
against Juniata and a home
conference double header Sat
urday against Ursinas.

Congratulations to Daryl
Clancy for being selected to the
Centennial Conference Honor
Roll for his effort against
Catholic last week. Clancy
went 3-4, and plated the game
winning run in the bottom of
the sixth inning.

El Nino postpones softball
team's journey to greatness

From Staff Reports
The Gettysburg College
Softball team was idle last week
due to El Nino and had three
postponed games.
The rest last week, how
ever, makes this week a tough
one as the Bullets face two
make-up twinbills - at
Elizabethtown on Monday and
York on Friday - sandwiched
between two regular twinbills
- at Juniata on Tuesday and at

Swarthmore on Saturday.
Gettysburg handed
Elizabethtown two losses, win
ning decisively, 5-2 and 6-4.
The Bullets overall
Record stands at 4-3, and they
look to dominate the competi
tion for the rest of the season.
Traci Bullock, Jen White,
and Jess Rising have been pro
viding much of the offensive
support with Rising scoring a
team high ten runs.
Melissa Hazzard leads the

pitching attack for the Bullets
and has appeared in four of the
Bullets seven games thus far.
Mary Beth Korekjo is
ranked in the conference in
many offensive categories and
hopes to provide the senior
leadership that the young team
that may need guidance.
With all the talent and
hitting power that this team has
there is no telling how far they
can go. The more runs you

Sports Weekly —
Men's lacrosse ripping competition with offensive barrages

by Henry Fawell
Staff Writer This week, the Gettys
burg men's lacrosse team im
proved its record to 3-1 in
magnificent fashion by trounc
ing their opponents with a
combined score of 44-7. Two
outstanding victories helped
the Bullets move up two spots
in the national polls from No.
8 to No. 6.
Gettysburg's luck began
on Tuesday, St. Patrick's Day,
as unranked Wooster College
came in to town looking for
an upset. The Bullets dashed
all hope for that, or even a
close game, as they unloaded
22 shots in the game's first
period. Wooster's single shot
that quarter sailed wide of the
cage.

The barrage never ceased
as Gettysburg outshot their op
ponent 55-14 throughout the
contest. Before the smoke had
finally cleared, 15 different
players had scored for the Bul
lets in their impressive 23-2
victory.
Senior Scott Lowery led

the Gettysburg offense by rack
ing up four goals and an assist
on the afternoon. Juniors Lee
Hemming and Ross Garretson
both scored three times, with
Garretson dishing out a team
high three assists.
Defensively, Gettysburg

carried a shutout into the final
minute of the contest before
Wooster managed to sneak in
two goals to help salvage their
trip. Goalie Andrew Barter tal
lied four saves in his three quar
ters of play.
The Bullets also proved
their dominance in unsettled

situations as they collected 40
groundballs to Wooster's 14.
On Saturday * Head
Coach Janczyk_'s squad faced
No. 16 Amherst College at a
chilly Musselman Stadium.
The cold weather could do
little, however, to slow down
the Gettysburg offense, which
reeled off five unanswered

Lacrosse players huddle-up after their battle with Amherst College on Saturday.

goals in the first 10:50 of play.
The Bullets headed into halftime
with a comfortable 9-2 lead.
Little changed in the sec
ond half, except for the Amherst
goalies. Their reserves, however,
could do even less to stop a Get
tysburg offense which scores
over 15 goals a game. Hemming
and freshman Pete Milliman
each tallied four goals in the
drubbing, while Lowery added
two goals and three assists to a
convincing 21-5 win.
While the Bullets needed

little help with improving their
rankings, they certainly received
a boost from some of the best
teams in the nation. Defending
champion and top ranked
Nazereth College was upset by
Adelphi College on Saturday,
while third ranked "Washington
College fell to Roanoke, a team
the Bullets beat 10-9 in the sea
son opener. Ohio Wesleyan sur
vived the weekend's shake-up by
knocking off Salisbury State,
thereby claiming the Division III
throne.

The Bullets will travel to
Mount St. Mary's this Wednes
day before taking on annual ri
val Hampden-Sydney this Satur
day at Musselman Stadium.
