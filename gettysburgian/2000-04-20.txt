Protest in the nation's capital

by matthew j. _achhammhl
Staff Writer
Images of protestors in Washing
ton, D.C. bombarded the media this
weekend as peaceful demonstrations
ensued, directed toward the Interna
tional Monetary Fund (IMF) and The
World Bank.
The week full of rallies, protests,
and teach-ins began last Sunday, April
9. The events kicked off with a rally
for Jubilee 2000, which is a move
ment for the cancellation of de
veloping nations' debts so that* * g
they may spend the money on_^^i
urgent areas of need such _asp_^
schools, hospitals, and other so-*_flfil

cial services. I
The rally brought together
the first wave of demonstrators,
about 3,000 people in all, fromj
every walk of life. Senior citizens, j
teenagers, small children and
middle-aged individuals unitedl
on The Mall in D.C. They heard!
speeches performing ,
and voiced their support for the.
cause and the week ahead. The
activists then joined hands in ai
Capitol
that extended beyond the White
building, sym
bolizing the chains of debt and the
need to break them.

During the week, demon
strators swarmed the Capitol
building and presented their con
cerns to each state's senator and
representative as well as other
influential members in Congress.
This part of the protest was de
signed to influence U.S. involve
ment in debt relief.
On Saturday, about 650

marching without permits. These
arrests spurred on the activist who con
tinued to march the next day.
Sunday proved the focal point _of
the demonstration, as activists shut
down the streets of D.C. in an attempt
to stop the IMF and World Bank from
holding meetings. Streets were blocked
by human chains from 12th to 20th and
from Constitution to K St.
The main focus was around the
location of the meetings near 17th St.

_ors maiched around the city, and gath
ered on the Fllipse, between the White
House and The Washington Monument.
Neaily 10,000 people tilled the Ellipse
and surrounding streets, and once again
came together in sohdanty.
By Sunday evening, both activists
and law enforcement officials pro
claimed a victory. 1 he activists had suc
ceeded in drawing attention to two or
ganizations which are usually hidden

protestors faced arrested for during their protest

At each street, a line ot activists was met
by a line ot D.C. Police in full not gear.
The police and the protesters had mi
nor clashes throughout the day, but the
police respected the peaceful protests,
and the activists were able to maintain
order. Well-trained police avoided re
peating the scenario of the Seattle WTO
protests last fall, which.became violent
although they were intended to be
peaceful as well.
While core affinity groups of ac
tivists blocked the streets, the protest-

managed to keep the city under control
in the midst of over 10,000 activists.
The IMF and World Bank are or
ganizations created to help poor coun
tries with development by giving loans
and bonds.
The protestors demanded that
these two organizations be more con
trolled and that they begin to take re
sponsibility for their actions. They cited
the World Bank and IMF as the cause
of many of the world's most crippling

¦gmedia corruption, globalization
Bof industries, mistreatment of
^¦ workers, and corporate corrup
kwtion of governments, including

more arrests were made, bring

Srrested protestors went willingly,
and according to reports, the po
I Uice applauded protestor's for
I ...their efforts and civil disobedi-

B_» The World Bank and IMF
¦yjijmeetings went on despite the
9_Q _^ masses trying to prevent them,
f |but the directors heard the voice
_gof the people. One leader of the
IMF appeared on television, stat
ing that both organizations were
working hard toward the goals of
the protestors, including debt re
lief, AIDS relief, and reformation
of the two organizations to pro
vide better humanitarian aid that will
not corrupt the governments of coun
tries, environments, or the people, and
will begin to truly destroy the poverty
which exists in our world.
The organizers of the protests
noted that this is only one battle in a
war against poverty which we all must
join. This is a revolution of peaceful
prosperity and a time when the world's
problems have the greatest chances of
being solved.

Gettysburg ranked #1 most wired
College in Pennsylvania

From GCPR
Gettysburg College has
for the second year made an
impressive showing in Yahoo
Internet Life magazine' s 100
Most Wired Colleges. Yahoo
ranked Gettysburg 14th in col
leges and baccalaureate schools,
placing the College first among
Pennsylvania schools in that
category. Rankings will be
posted in the May issue of the
magazine, which is currently
available for purchase.
Contributing to
Gettysburg 's success this year -
a year in which the Yahoo!
rankings and criteria were
closely scrutinized - was the

continued development of
CNAV, the College' s campus
network system. CNAV is the
first software program devel
oped for use by an entire cam
pus. About 90 percent of the
campus community have used
CNAV; more than 80 percent
of students and 50 percent of
faculty use it regularly.
CNAV takes on different
personalities for different
groups on campus. Faculty
member' s CNAV tools allow
them to edit course informa
tion, access advisees' informa
tion and access budget infor
mation. Advisors' CNAV tools
allow them to track appoint
ments, access student records

and monitor mid-term defi
ciencies. Students' CNAV tools
provide access to campus
events, course catalog, elec
tronic reserves for onuses, pei
sonal financial information and
information on courses in
which they are cuirently en
rolled.
CNAV is also available to
parents, alumni and accepted
students, expanding the elec
tronic reach of Gettysburg ' s
campus to the extended com
munity.
The College 's Board of
Trustees recently voted to es
tablish a separate corporate
entity to market CNAV, based
on the success of the program
at Gettysburg, the enormous

mteiest it has generated else
where Mid .i preliminary busi
ness analysis. "The possibilities
ai e exciting roi both a financial
return to the College and for
enhancing our reputation as a
leader in educational technol
ogy, " said Provost Dan
DeNicola.
In addition to CNAV, the
Yahoo! rankings also consid
ered Gettysburg's ability to of
fer wireless access on campus,
houis of technical support,
computer labs and "smart"
classrooms equipped with the
latest technology.

LEGENDS AND MYTHS MAKE NOVEL
WORTH READING

by Anne Schenck Book
Reviewer
Susanna Kearsley.
Named of the Dragon. New
York: Berkley Books, 1998.
295 pp.
I'm not sure what com
pelled me to pick up Susanna
Kearsley's Named of the
Dragon, since I don't ordinarily
go for books labeled "roman
tic suspense," but I'm glad I did
this time.
Named of the Dragon is
set in present-day Wales during
the Christmas holiday. When
Lyn Ravenshaw, a literary
agent, and one of her writers
escape to London to enjoy their
holiday, they find their vacation
more disturbing than relaxing.

The young, widowed Lyn
continues to be plagued by
nightmares about the death of
her infant son. She is all the
more troubled when they be
come eerily similar to the his
tory and myth of the surround
ing area: the prophecies of
Merlin and the legend of
Arthur.
When Elen, the eccentric
neighbor, a young woman who
shares a past similar to Lyn's
and nightmares just as vivid,
claims that Lyn is the chosen
protector of her infant son, Lyn
becomes desperate to discover
the meaning of her dreams.
Elen is convinced her son is
being stalked by dragons, and,
as social services close in on
her, Lyn realizes there is more
truth than myth to Elen's
claims.

With the help of .1 reclu
sive playwright, Lyn sifts
through the mythology and leg
end that seem to have merged
with her life to uncover the
truth in her dreams and help
put to rest the fear and hurt
that have followed her since
her son's death.
Named of the Dragon
carefully weaves together the
realistic story of two women on
holiday and the magic of
prophecy from the days ot the
Knights of the Round Table and
heroes who never die.
Kearsley's attention to detail is
outstanding and the skill with
which she approaches both
angles of her story is both im
pressive and intelligent. Her
descriptions are lively and po
etic and her language is clear
and graceful. For the Ameri¬

can reader, Kearsley offers the
authenticity of an English
work: the spellings and nu
ances ot a language and culture
just ever so slightly different
from our own.
Named of the Dragon is

of the seafood was extremely fresh
and flavorful. The flavoring of the
fish stock added a great deal to the
seafood without overpowering its
natural flavor. This entree was ac
companied by a large homemade
crouton smothered in a strong
cheese, which offered a perfect
contrast to the light flavored stew.
One of the best compli
ments to my meal was the service.
My waitress was attentive without
being an annoyance. She was very
amiable and always came to the
table with a warm, comforting
smile. My dinner at the Blue Par¬

rot Bistro was one of the most
pleasant dining experiences that I
have had in some time. I could
tell by the preparation and presen
tation of the entrees that the chef
is truly a chef and not a cook. I
could also tell by the long list of
specials that the chef is extremely
creative and talented. There is an
ample variety of appetizers, light
entrees, and full entrees on the
menu. In addition, there is also a
long list of appetizers and entrees
on the Specials insert of the menu,
which are changed on a regular
basis. The Specials Menu itself is
as long as the full menu of many
other restaurants. At the Blue Par
rot, a meal can be found to satiate

any craving.
All portions at the Blue Par
rot are quite large, and the prices
are reasonable given these portions
and the overall quality. One can
expect to pay over twenty dollars
for a meal including an appe
tizer. A bottle of wine, or
drinks, will add to the total bill.
As with the meals, all drinks are
appropriately priced.

Virgil Kane s Culinary Corner

After the severe disap
pointment of my last dining
experience, I decided to return
to a restaurant in my beloved
Gettysburg. For this week's
installment of "Virgil's waist
line enhancement," I chose to
dine at the Blue Parrot Bistro
on Chambersburg St. It is
within easy walking distance
for most members of our col
lege community, and it offers a
wide and ever-changing variety
of meals to fit everyone's fancy.
After my meal at the Blue Par
rot I would recommend it to

anyone who is seeking an ex
cellent meal out, in a comfort
able environment.
The Blue Parrot Bistro
offers its patrons the choice to
sit in the casual bar and lounge
area or the beautifully ap
pointed dining room. The at
mosphere is relaxed and
friendly, and the staff is atten
tive and pleasant. For a simple
causal meal, a drink at the bar,
or a more formal meal with
friends and family in the din
ing room, everyone will feel
comfortable in the Blue Parrot.

For my appetizers I
chose to sample both the crab
bisque and the artichoke dip.
The artichoke dip was full of
artichoke chunks and a tasty
blend of cheeses. It is served
piping hot with toasted pita
bread for dipping. The portion
is very large and would cer
tainly be enough for two.
The crab bisque was di
vine. The rich creamy broth
contained a large quantity of
shredded crabmeat, which
teased my palate. I also believe
the broth was flavored with a
burgundy wine, but my palate
was still dancing from the arti
choke dip, so I cannot be sure.
Entrees are served with
bistro bread and a house salad.

With the bread, my waitress
brought olives and spiced
parmesan cheese, which
complemented the garlic-fla
vored olive oil already at my
table. Dipping my bread into
a plate covered in olive oil and
parmesan cheese was wonder
ful, even though I felt my belt
become ever tighter with each
bite. The house salad consisted
of a delectable mix of assorted
greens and all three dressing
options (a vinaigrette, a Caesar,

and a bleu cheese) are home- ordei any tvpe ol blackened
made. I tried the bleu cheese beef, because it is enss w> ovu
as well as the Caesar, and nei- season the meat. When this

cheese. Bleu cheese has a //

but in this case the taste \!
was not overpowering. I
felt as though I was eat
ing a salad, not just a
plate of dressing. The

light with a pleasant tart
ness. It had a full flavor,

away from spicy foods, and
I found the seasoning to be
quite complimentary to the
cut of meat. The spice of
the cayenne created a palpable
bite on the sides of my tongue,
without masking the rich fla
vor of the meat. In fact, I found
the seasoning amplified the fla
vors in the meat that are nor¬

mally extremely subtle. This
gave the meat a different, yet
thoroughly enjoyable, taste.
The second entree that I
sampled was the seafood stew.
This was a wonderful mix of
seafood steamed in a fish broth
flavored with saffron, onions
and tomatoes. I was pleasantly
surprised to find that the chef
used an ample amount of saf

more in its weight than gold,

In defense of
Homelessness Awareness
I was sin pi lsed and displeased by the
leauion to the cardboard village in
the papei last week. Authentic ex
pei ltnte, of couise not, it would not be
possible, and not expected, oi so I
thought, fheieal purpose ot the caid
board village was to raise money and
awareness, and both goals were accom
plished. With the help of Alpha Delta
Pi, Amnesty International, International
Club, Center tor Public Service, the
College Socialists, Student Senate, the
Education Club, the Writing House, the

Philosophy House, Chi Omega, Delta
Gamma, GECO and Habitat for Hu
manity, we laised over $400 that will
be split between the homeless shelter
in town and the Adams County Habi
tat tor Humanity. I consider that di
rectly helping the homeless through our
efforts. Fin thei more, for one day, there
was something in the middle of this
campus that reminded people that there
are homeless out theie. So many of us
live in this world where extieme pov
ert\ is far away; on that Thursday we
brought it a little closei to home.

To defend the environment of that
Thursda) night is harder because, for
the most pait, I was not involved. The
food and grill weie brought by several
organizations and because we urged
participation in our fundraising effort,
the oi gamzers ot the event felt it would
be haid to actually get these organiza
tions to quit their activities. As for the
hot chocolate and tea brought out by
the dming services, it was symbolic ot
the trucks that drive around cities pro
viding hot beverages to the homeless on
cold nights, we |ust couldn't keep the
truck out there all night. One of the

Where has all the
common sense gone?
Biowsing thiough the April 13,
2000 edition of The Gettysburg
tan, I read about what I consider
some of the most stupid things this cam
pus has had to witness, and frankly, I
am very upset at the lack of common
sense here at Gettysburg College.
For example, let's take the foun
tain issue. I, like many, am appalled that
someone would waste gallons of water
by dumping soap into it. However, if
we are still in a drought-like condition
in Adams County, then why is the Col
lege filling up the fountain in the first
place? Talk about the pot calling the
kettle black. Yes, I know it looks pretty,
but so does our environment.
Second, I was going to address the
cardboard village, but as I read Mary
Fichtner's article, I realized Fichtner
nailed the problem for me. I, too, saw

the village as a mockery. As 1 watched
laughing students tape boxes together
and listening to music earlier that
Thursday, it kind of reminded me more
of a nursery school project than a col
lege-level awareness project. In all due
respect, I hope it goes better next year.
Third, I understand students need
more parking spaces. However, for
those of you who are complaining about
tickets, perhaps you should learn to
obey rules on signs and feed the meters
like you are supposed to. You want more
parking spaces, yet you cannot even
handle the responsibility you have al
ready. As for double-parking with the
emergency lights on, well, you should
not even be double-parked to begin
with. Your car is sitting out in the lane
of traffic just so you can run in real
quick to get money at the MAC or talk
to a friend you could have easily called
on the phone. Those emergency lights

tra hours of sleep or free time for use as needed.
Imagine a world where no one felt rushed and everyone was
alert and attentive. The right entrepreneur could make this dream a
reality by opening a sleep or time banking operation. It's not just a
business, it's a public service.

le to store the extra sleep gained on the week
ends and over vacations for use later in the
semester. For example, the Winter Break is
approximately 30 days in length. If a student
slept for 10 hours a night over the break, that
would yield 2 hours per day, or 60 total extra
sleep hours. These could be stored in a sleep
bank and used later in the semester. Students
would no longer stumble into 8 or 9 a.m.
classes; they could simply wake up at 7, with
draw 4 or 5 hours of catchup sleep from the
bank, and enjoy a nice leisurely breakfast
before class.
Time could also be stored for later use.
One hour of useless time for each day from
the beginning of the semester could be stored
for use later in the term. All-nighters would be
virtually eliminated! At 1 or 2 a.m., a student
could simply withdraw 4 or 5 hours and get
started on work as though it were the early
hour of 8 p.m.

Of course the logistics of this plan would
be rather bizarre, and banks would most likely
charge fees or provide little interest on sleep/
time accounts. However, additional services
could be offered. Imagine how grateful your
friends and family would be if you wrote them
a check for 4 hours of time when they really
needed it...
Eventually, sleep and time banking would
move online (along with everything else),
opening the exciting possibilities of

could purchase, through a secure server, ex-

Ike Vdclntdenn'_s Pulpit

by John Dunlap
Political Columnist
Last week the Senate of
the state of South Carolina
came to a compromise on an
extremely delicate issue: the
presence of the Confederate
battle flag over the state capital
of South Carolina in Columbia.
The Senate voted to take down
the flag and move it to a war
memorial on the statehouse
grounds. Now the bill will go
to the House and to Governor
Jim Hodges.
The issue of the battle flag
has plagued South Carolina for
years. The NAACP has boy
cotted tourism to the state, and
in the recent presidential pri
mary the two major Republican
presidential candidates, Gover
nor George W Bush of Texas

grown as a human being be
cause of these four years.
I remember the fear and
excitement that I had when I
first arrived, and I remember
the long hours trying to find my
own place here. I suppose that
socially I have had a few prob
lems, simply because my plea
sures in life have always been a
little bit different than the av
erage person's, but those
passed once I found a group of
like-minded individuals to
share in the excitement of the
freedoms afforded in a liberal
arts environment. In all hon
esty I still feel suffocated by the
typical Gettysburg walk, wear,
talk and social climate, but I
have learned one important les
son of tolerance. Instead of
senseless bitching, I have
learned to ignore this small cli
mate of petty feuds and self
degradation.

What I will take most
from these years are the long
conversations with friends and
faculty about relevant intellec
tual issues, or just about life. I
cannot thank the faculty

and Senator John McCain of
Arizona said it was an issue for
the people of South Carolina,
not outsiders, to decide. Now
that the race is over and Bush
is the presumptive nominee of
the party, McCain has changed
his tune and is calling for the
flag to be brought down.
This is an issue that
crosses political party lines. In
1998 both gubernatorial can
didates, the then Republican
governor David Beasley and
Democrat Jim Hodges agreed
on the issue, calling for it to
come down. Two other former
governors, Republican Carroll
Campbell and Democrat and
current U.S. Secretary of Edu
cation Richard Reilly, have
joined them.

While both Bush and
McCain were right that the is
sue must be decided by the

enough, and truly, it is to them
and their inspiration that I owe
my education. Sure we have
all had a bad class here and
there, but I really believe that I
am leaving with exactly what I
came here for - an education.
Now not all of you are in search
of this, simply because a degree
gets you a better job, but this
was my purpose in coming and
I am damn glad that four years
later I have a Gettysburg degree
(well not yet - keep those fin
gers crossed).
We have all seen the Col¬

lege change, and in reality, tor
the better over these years. I
only hope that the underclass
men will always look to their
own individual needs in getting
this education. For example,
education is not about require
ments, and it is not about "get
ting out of this place." It is
about constant learning from
the whole of your experience
and coming out of this environ
ment a well-rounded and stron
ger individual. Be your own
person, learn for your own
needs and do nothing to re
strain the creative drive that all

people of South Carolina, that
does not mean that the rest of
the nation cannot voice its
opinion. The Confederate
battle flag should come down.
The Confederacy died in 1865
and that flag was placed atop
the capital in the late 1950s to
protest desegregation. It was a
slap in the face for the Civil
Rights movement and a mes
sage from the South to the rest
of the nation. South Carolina,
of course, was not alone. Other
states, such as Georgia and Ala
bama, made the Confederate
flag a part of their state flag.
Those states should also move
to change their flags.
Some people use the
Confederate flag as a symbol of
hate, and it should not be used
that way. The Confederacy
should have never been
formed, but it was, and by our

people have. Your passions are
the expression of your deepest
core emotions, and to strangle
them for the needs of the col
lective whole is to rob your sur
roundings of what could be in
spirational. Each one of us is
an artist, each one is a poet, and
each one of us has a deep well
of talent that we are often too
scared and too intimidated to
explore.
1 see people on a daily
basis with bitter dispositions
and horrible attitudes simply
because this place is too shel¬

tered tor them. I see people
hate what they really don't un
derstand - and that is shelter is
in our own bias and bigotry. 1
know this -1 walked around for
years complaining, and I even
went to London to escape, but
1 can tell you that Gettysburg
has truly won me over, and I
will miss sitting on the steps of
Weidensall with a large Coke
and rings under my eyes. I will
even miss people talking about
me at the bar behind my back.
Life is not about judge
ment, it is not about watching
and commenting on people as

ancestors. Men fought and
died under the Confederate
flag. They were Americans and
we should honor them. Mov
ing the flag to the war memo
rial is appropriate, and even
most African-American mem
bers of the legislature agreed
with this. The NAACP is not
accepting that, but they should
relent and help bring South
Carolina together. Thousands
of South Carolina's sons died
in the Civil War and they de
survc to be remembered. The
war memorial is a perfect place
to honor them and remember
South Carolina's history.
We cannot erase our
history. The anthem of my
home state of Maryland criti
cizes Abraham Lincoln and the
Civil War, but it should not be
changed. Lincoln did hold the
state legislature hostage with

they walk past. It is not about
snide comments and catalogues
in the mailroom. Most of all,
it is not about a perfect figure
(whatever that is) or ordering
the perfect drink, or seeing
how many notches you can get
in your bed post so your friends
think you're cool when, in re
ality, you're a destructive force
corrupting your environment
through your own insecurity.
Life is about constant
learning, and the finest expres
sion of this is through personal
expression and passion. I wish
that years ago, or even months

ago, I was thinking along these
lines, and I wish that my dream
of a higher education Utopia
had been realized here. But in
reality, it is exactly that - a uto
pia that even if I had I know I
could not appreciate. Instead,
I will take as a substitute a small
semi-closed minded liberal arts
college in southern Pennsylva
nia where I finally had the free
dom to think, the instruction
to inspire, and the desire to let
my passions roam free. After
four years, all the bad is irrel
evant, and I am left only with
the good in this place - and a

military force
so it would not leave the union
and it is a part of our history.
While we cannot change his
tory, we can help undo its
wrongs.
The Confederate battle
flag was not put atop the capi
tal to honor Confederate war
dead, it was put there as a sym
bol against civil rights, and that
is why it should be moved. The
African-American people of
South Carolina should not have
to live in a state that has a flag
flying above their capital which
is offensive to them. South
Carolina is a rapidly growing
state that can continue to ease
race relations while moving
forward economically by mov
ing the Confederate battle flag.

An experience cheapened: On getting paid to do what you love

by Jonathan
Hemmerdinger
Contributing Writer
Last summer I skippered
a twenty-four foot center con
sul Privateer for Outermost
Harbor Marine in Chatham,
Massachusetts: it was a child
hood dream - the perfect job.
My days were split between
running the beach shuttle to the
outer-islands and guiding seal
cruises for camera-toting tour
ists. The weather was pictur
esque, the scenery breathtaking
and the pay hefty. For a col
lege student, there is no better
summer job.
Getting paid to be on the
water seemed too good to be
true. Although the work
sounds glorious, running a fer
ryboat in your home waters
comes at a cost.

First, the merchant ma
rine credentials do not come
easy. I applied for the Twenty
Five Ton Master's License for
Vessels on Near-Coastal Wa
ters. This certificate would al
low me to skipper any vessel
under twenty-five tons
(roughly fifty feet in length)
anywhere in U.S. waters.
The requirements for this
license are 720 days upon the
water in the last five years, 300
of which must be on open
ocean. One day, according to
the Coast Guard, is no less than
four hours upon the water.
Days must be logged, certified
by the boat owner, are are sub¬

ject to scrutiny by the Coast
Guard.
Obtaining documented
hours is the easy part. Appli
cants must also submit drug test
results, CPR and First Aid Cer
tification, three letters of rec
ommendation, fingerprints,
and a notarized copy of an
original birth certificate.
Then the wrestling starts.
There are few organizations as
unorganized and unethusiastic
as the Coast Guard Testing
Centers. Having an application
approved is a spiritual victory.
The process took me six
months, after which I was eli
gible to take the test.The Coast
Guard Master's License Test is
divided into four sections:
Navigation Problems, Naviga
tion General, Deck General,
and Rules of the Road.

I passed the Master's Li
cense test in early June, then
moved up to Chatham to be
gin work. Cape Cod resembles
an arm bent at ninety degrees
-stretching east, then shooting
north. At Provincetown, the
end of the road, the cape swirls
back upon itself like a broken
wrist. Chatham is located at the
elbow of the "arm." It is a com
munity bunkered by the Atlan
tic Ocean to the east and Nan
tucket Sound to the south. In
addition, many bays, coves, and
harbors wind inland. Three
barrier beaches, nearly eight
miles in total length, protect
Chatham from the Atlantic.
Nantucket lies only fifteen

miles to the south. Chatham's
disconnected location earned it
the affectionate nickname
"First Stop of the F.ast Wind."
So powerful are nature's forces
that the landscape of Chatham
is in constant motion. The
beaches are continually bom
barded, being strengthened in
some areas and eroded in oth
ers. Ten years ago, a mythic
Nor'easter ripped through the
barrier beach and slammed the
mainland, taking houses, cars,
and lives with it. The map of
Chatham, like so many times
before, was redrawn.
I have spent much of my
life boating in this small town,
so the thought of doing so for
cash was intoxicating. 1 began
work for Outermost Harbor
Marine in mid-June, the start
of the tourist season. Outer
most Harbor Marine _Mts as the

southernmost point of
Chatham Harbor, making it a
prime gateway to the barnei
islands that surround the com
munity. These desolate beaches
attract tourists by the hundreds
in mid-summer to fish,
birdwatch, and relax.
In addition, the waters
surrounding Chatham sustain a
growing community of Grey
Seals--a curious and friendly
species that tourists adore. Seal
Cruises, hour-long excursions
through Chatham Harbor, are
a big seller. The seals have be
come accustomed to the boats,
cameras, and gawking faces
they often surface just feet from
the boats and look up with cu¬

rious eyes. Their facial expres
sions are so human, andtheir
interest in the people so in
tense, that they seem more in
terested in us than we are in
them. As a full-time captain for
Outermost Harbor Marine, I
spent hundreds of hours upon
the water. On sunny days, the
thirteen-passenger vessel was
filled to capacity all day long.
I'd burn seventy-five gallons of
gasoline and carry over 150
passengers. The stream of tour
ists kept me running non-stop
for nine hours; everything I ate
and drank was on the boat
while underway. My vessel
earned Outermost Harbor over
one thousand dollars on such
days. I made an even 25% com
mission.

Although those days were
some of the best of my life, it
was not the type of boating I
was accustomed to. Before get
ting a Captain's License, being
on the water was something
that I did for pleasure, not

money. It wasn't work--I
couldn't imagine it ever could
be. That's why I applied for a
Captain's License. I quickly
learned, however, that money
stole my basic enjoyment of
boating. Instead of being re
laxed and content, I was up
tight, stressed, and hurried.
Tight schedules and complain
ing passengers replaced slow
cruises and cold beers—I was
now entertaining the public,
not myself. It was more like
driving a school bus than pilot
ing a boat.
That's why, everyday af
ter work, I'd pack a few beers
and take a couple of friends
fishing. We'd go on my own
boat, through the same harbor,
pass the same barrier islands,
gawk at the same seals, and
catch fresh striped bass for din
ner. I needed that extra time on

the water to fill an emotional
void, not a monetary one. Only
when I'm on the water fishing,
without paying passengers, am
I reminded of what I love.

Common Sense

are for emergencies, not for
your own personal errands.
The same goes for people who
park along the yellow curb in
front of the Dining Hall with
their emergency lights on so
they can go in and eat dinner.
Just grow up, pay the tickets,
and obey the rules people, be
cause in real life, the police do
not really care if the "No Park
ing" area was the only spot you
could put your car.
Finally, if the College au
thorities are going to try to add
more parking spaces, they
should first clean up the park
ing problems in present lots.
Students living in Sophomore
Honors, Corner Cottage and
Colonial, among other residen
cies, sometimes cannot park in
the lot adjacent to their residen
cies because inconsiderate col
lege students who do not even
live in these buildings take the
spots. There are no rules

from page 9
against these non-residents
parking there. Also, the College
seems to add to the parking
problem in some respects.
There is a shed taking up two
spots behind the Sophomore
Honors House which is ru
mored to belong to the Athletic
Department and was supposed
to have been moved back to its
original spot after the snow
melted and final touches were
made to the area around the
tennis courts. I don't see any
more snow on the ground, and
I have not seen any workers out
there in months. You can add
all the spaces you want, but first
you need to fix the problems
you've got.
Well, I could go on about
other things, but I think I have
gotten my point across. So, in
the future, please be a little bit
more responsible, people, and

use some common sense.

Homelessness

to set the tone during a small
conversation about
homelessness, a conversation
that never took place because
of lack of interest. During this

clude facts about homelessness
as well as pointing out that our
experience, multiplied by 100,
may give the participants an
iota of what it feels like to be
homeless, but not much more.
I want to close by saying
two things. If you want an au-

thentic experience of
homelessness I suggest contact
ing the National Coalition for
the Homeless about the urban
plunge. In this program you
are sent into Washington D.C.
with your sleeping bag, the
clothes you are wearing, and
seventy-five cents for a week
end or longer. Also, instead of
going to the bar to cheer your
self up, think about this little
fact; the amount of money this
student body spends on alco¬

hol in a month is enough to
sponsor a Habitat for Human

the country.
We would like to thank
all those who participated and
supported our efforts. A spe

Habitat for Humanity and the

Baseball "reaps" benefits Women's golf on par
of Grimm's big day at Dickinson Invite

Steve Jenkins
Staff Reporter
After some curvy roads
and flat tires the Bullet Base
ball team re-fueled with high
octane, as they rolled past
Dickinson 7-3.
It looked as if the needle
was desperately fading to the
"E" but luckily, Kevin Grimm
was there to fuel the car with
the good stuff.
Grimm, normally known
for his slick fielding, used his
stick against Drckinson to drive
home four runs. Appearing at
the plate with the bases loaded,
Grimm tripled to clear the
bases. In his next at-bat Grimm
laced a single to right field driv
ing in another run.
"Sometimes you just have
those days, " said Captain John
Woods. "The ball looks like a
big beach ball coming in. You

just feel the flow. Today was
Gnmmy's day."
A good day it certainly
was for the Bullets as the of
fense, defense and pitching all
came together and performed
well. "We played fundamen
tally well today," said first-year
catcher Jeff Ebert.
"Drew pitched well, guys
were hitting, we didn't make
any errors, and it showed on
the Scoreboard."
Nick Marzella went 2 for
3 with two doubles that hit the
fence so hard, the chain-links
actually started to shed tears.
Marzella racked up two RBls
for the Bullets, putting him just
shy of 30 total for the season.
Leadoff specialist Jim
Nastasi scored 3 runs, and Jack
Tanner had a plate appearance,
to finish off the Bullets output.
Drew Chiesa was a rock
of consistency once again,

pitching nine complete innings
to wrap up the win on the lull.
Chiesa only allowed i runs,
and the Bullets played flawless
defense behind him, putting the
onus on the offense to get the
job done. A job they obviously
didn't take lightly.
"Hopefully this will jump
start us" said center-fielder
Chris Lunardi.
"We have to play really
well from here on out to win
this thing, and hopefully this is
just the first step."
So, the pioverbial i_ai
keeps on chugging. It mav not
be the Porsche rh_.ir it once was,
but have you evei heard the
story of the tin tie and the lab
bit? It wasn't the fastest oi the
nicest competitor that won the
race was it? Nosu. It was the
competitoi that nevei quit.
Nobody says it's going to be
easy, and luckily for the Bullets

This past week was the

made a successful trip to

The Bullets had already
breezed past Haverford and
Western Maryland, so this was
perhaps the team's first true

more at stake in this game.

The Bullets stormed out

Lauren Davis
Assistant Sports Editor
The hometown crowd, a
familiar track, a week of solid
training...the members of
Gettysburg's track & field team
had a lot going for them when
they walked into the Mason
Dixon Invitational last week
end. Throw in several record
breaking performances and
what do you get? Two teams
that captured victors' cups by
the day's end.
The men's victory on Sat
urday came a week after Mes
siah edged them out of second
place at the Messiah Invita
tional. This time, the Bullets
turned the tables on their home
turf, outdistancing the Falcons'
59 points with 140 of their own
while overtaking second-place
Dickinson.

These athletes were all awarded
the men's Silver Spike for then
combined efforts.

2-5 Gettysburg finish in the
hammer throw, earning silver
with a throw of 129' 0". Class
mates Gene Kraus and Williams

throws of 127; 4 1/4" and 111
5", respectively. First-year Carl
York rounded out the scoring
with a fifthplace throw of 93
7". On the track, junior Nick
LaPorta and first-year Ryan
Foster finished 3-5 in the 200

with times of 23.11 and 23.53.
respectively. Junior J.T. Farrell
concluded scoring in the open
sprints with a sixth-place time
of51.09inthe400.
In the distance events_,
junior Jon Catlett established a
new meet record on his way tc
victory in the steeplechase. His

the relay has gone under the 4
minute mark.
By the day's end, both
teams had clearly outdistanced
and outraced their competition,

scoring in nearly event and win
ning a total of 9 events on the
day. The men and women re
turned to action yesterday at
Dickinson for the Little Three
Meet, an annual tradition where
they face off against conference
rivals Dickinson and Franklin tk
Marshall. Although neither
team captured the win, there
were several outstanding perfor
mances on the day, and it must
be recognized that the meet's
scoring system, which allows just
two athletes from each team to

score in any event, cannot accu
rately depict any team's strength
and depth.
The Lady Bullets tallied
120 points to Dickinson's 149,
while F8cM scored 96, placing
the women second.

umph but have also been humbled by
defeat.
Last Thursday the Bullets met
Centennial Conference opponent, Bryn
Mawr in an at home sweep. After three
goals apiece from senior Kim
Fernandez, sophomore Becky Bucha,
and first-year Katie Mernken, the Bul-

Goalies Michelle Centrella and Kate
Auman combined for nine saves in
Gettysburg's defense.
As the Bullets cruised to an 18-3
victory, they improved their record to
11-1, the best season start in the 29
year program's history.
Gettysburg then pushed its win¬

ning stie_.ik to 12 aftei defeating Cen
tennial _ConfeieiKc inul, Muhlenberg
on their tint held in Allentovvn, PA on
Saturday.
The Mule defense couldn't stop
senior Amy Stambaugh who hammered
in tour goals, while teammate Bucha
launched hve past the Muhlenberg
goalie.
By halrtnne the score stood at 8
4, but the second half proved lethal for
the home team. Sophomore Anna
Haugen hummed two shots in the cage,
while juniors Jessica Seedorf and Susie
Mitchell, and first-vear Megan Murphy
each sank a shot apiece.
Relentless defense was played by
junior Lynsey Ward who dominated on
ground balls and mid-held checks.
By the end of this match-up, the
Bullets were victorious over the Mules.

14-7. On Sunday, Gettysburg met No. 4
ranked William Smith on Memorial
Field in a non-conference competition.
Not only had the weather heated
up, but the competition had as well, be
cause the Bullets were looking to settle
a score that was waged last year, in a
William Smith victory over the Bullets.
This team was hot on the trail of re¬

venge.
Gettysburg began the scoring with
an unassisted goal by Haugen and
shortly after, Murphy snagged a draw
control and pushed the lead to two.
The Herons quickly retaliated
with a four-goal streak that put them
ahead 4-2.
Stambaugh answered with a free
position shot and teammate Seedorf tied
it 4-4. Before the half, William Smith
penetrated the Bullets defense for a half
time score of 5-4.
When play resumed after half
time, the Bullets came up short on a 6
l Heron scoring spree. Despite lead
ing the Herons in ground balls, 33-23
and 37-23 in shots, Gettysburg lost their
first game in a twelve game winning
streak.
Yesterday the Lady Bullets de
feated conference opponent Western
Maryland, 15-9.
With this 13th win on the season,
Gettysburg tied a program record.
Their record now stands at 13-2
overall, 7-0 in the Conference..

The Lady Bullets' host their next
competitors on Memorial Field next
Wednesday.
Gettysburg will take on
Swarthmore at 4 pm.
