The book-bargaining battle:
best buy or a far cry?

Buying textbooks through the
internet is a relatively new phenom
enon, but sales have grown rapidly as
college students have discovered the
conveniences of completing their aca
demic book shopping by merely click
ing a few buttons.
The thought of bypassing the
Book Rush and its unpleasant crowds
and lines is appealing, even more so
when one considers the simplicity of
purchasing texts online.
Avoiding the hassle of lugging a
heavy cart around the CUB Ballroom
certainly sounds appealing.
The real question is; which
shopping technique is more economi
cal overall?
In considering whether or not
to utilize an internet textbook mer
chant, one must look at the big pic
ture. First decide which kind of books
you would otherwise choose to
purchace at the College Bookstore:
new, used, or reserved. This in itself

Online textbook merchants create
competition for the College
Bookstore, but are they worth your
money?

for exceptionally cheaper prices. Ac
cording to the Bookstore, the Text
book Reservation Program saved stu
dents over $30,000 on Fall textbook
purchases.
Next, keep in mind the shipping
fees attached to online sales. Request
ing an order overnight can potentially
add a sizable shipping and handling
sum to your bill.
Choosing to receive your order
within five to seven business days can
lessen the cost of ordering through the
internet.
Finally, online purchases require
the use of a credit card pin number.
This eliminates the option of buying
through the internet for students who
do not have access to credit cards.
The College Bookstore main
tains that its prices are reasonable and
compare favorably with those of
online merchants.
The bottom line when deciding
whether to shop online or visit the
Bookstore is to examine your priori
ties: which do you value more - price
or convenience?

Violence proving a persistent problem

By Nadine Hoffman
News Editor
Another episode of violence tran
spired early Sunday morning, adding
yet one more account to this year's
alarming list of such violations at the
College.
At approximately 1:25 a.m., jun
ior Michael LaPuma was assaulted with
a lead pipe by an unidentified male on
Barbehann Alley.
LaPuma, who had been partici
pating in a party at his residence on
Stevens Street, was summoned outside
when a female student informed him
that three males were "egging" the
house. Upon being confronted by

LaPuma, one of the trio of vandals ran
in the direction of the alley, and L aPuma
began to pursue him as the other two
fled. He returned inside without catch
ing any of them, but went back to the
scene of the confrontation and saw that
two of the young men had returned.
One of the two jumped LaPuma
and hit him in the head repeatedly with
a weapon that appeared to be a lead pipe.
LaPuma recalls being hit once, knocked
to the ground, and then beaten repeat
edly about eight or nine times about the
head and body.
LaPuma was transported to
Gettysburg Hospital and treated for se
vere lacerations to the head, a broken
hand, and other less serious injuries to
the ankle and hamstring. He was re¬

leased following treatment of the bro
ken bones and a three inch gash across
his face, and proceeded to make a state
ment to the Borough Police, including
a description of his attacker.
The perpetrator wielding the
weapon was described as a white high
school age male, approximately 5_'6" to
5'8". None of the suspects have been
apprehended as of yet, although the po
lice are conducting an investigation.
Of the incident, LaPuma states, "I
no longer feel safe on campus." He has
invested in pepper spray and says of
campus safety, "We should be more
aware and not assume that our school
is safe."

Senator Ted Stevens to Speak

From GCPR
U.S. Senator Ted Stevens
(R-Alaska), recipient of the
1999 Eisenhower Leadership
Prize given this past spring by
Gettysburg College and The
Eisenhower World Affairs In
stitute of Washington, D.C.,
will deliver an address at
Gettysburg College's Christ
Chapel at 5:30 p.m. On Octo
ber 15.
The Eisenhower Leader
ship Prize publicly recognizes
a leader who is influential in
national and international are
nas and honors an individual
whose lifetime accomplish
ments reflect Dwight D.
Eisenhower's legacy of integ
rity and leadership.
Stevens, who was ap¬

pointed solicitor of the Depart
ment of the Interior by Presi
dent Eisenhower in I960,
worked successfully for
Alaska's admission to the
Union as a 49th state. A mem
ber of the Senate for 30 years,
his tenure in the Senate makes
him the sixth most senior mem
ber among his colleagues, and
second among Republicans.
He currently serves as chair
man of the Senate Appropria
tions Committee and Defense
Appropriations Subcommittee.
Born in Indianapolis, In
diana, in 1923, Stevens was a
pilot in the China - Burma -
India theater during World War
II, supporting the Flying Tigers
of the 14th Air Force. He re
ceived two Distinguished Fly
ing Crosses, two Air Medals

and the Yuan Hai medal
awaided by the Republic of
China. Following the war, he
graduated from UCLA and
Harvard Law School, and piac
ticed law in Washington, D.C.
In the early 1950s he moved to
Alaska, at the time a terntoiy
of the U.S., and practiced law
in Fairbanks.
In 1964 he was elected to
the Alaska House of Represen
tatives. Following the death of
Alaska's Senator E.L. Bob
Bartlett in 1968, then-Gover
nor Walter Hickel appointed
Stevens to fill the vacancy.
Under Alaska law, he had to
stand for election in 1970 to
complete Bartlett's term, which
expired in 1972. He was sub
sequently elected for a full term
in 1972, and re-elected in
1978, 1984, 1990 and 1996.

"Asteroid Patrol" discovers
asteroids, tracks motion

From GCPR
If you are worried that a
doomsday asteroid, like the
ones in Deep Impact and Arma
geddon, will hit earth anytime
soon, relax. Gettysburg
College's Larry Marschall and
his merry band of asteroid ob
servers, the Gettysburg College
Asteroid Patrol, are keeping a
watchful eye on the sky.
Asteroid impacts that
lead to death and destruction
occur only about once every
100 million years or so, accord
ing to Marschall, a professor of
physics at Gettysburg College.
Those aren't bad odds, consid
ering that 40,000 asteroids
have already been catalogued

and thousands more are wait
ing to be discovered.
During the 1998-99 aca
demic year, Marschall and the
Asteroid Patrol (a group of
Gettysburg faculty and stu
dents) added two new asteroids
to the database at the Minor
Planet Center at Harvard Uni
versity and tracked the motion
of several other faint asteroids.
They used telescopes at the
National Undergraduate Re
search Observatory in Flagstaff,
Arizona, and the Gettysburg
College Observatory. " We use
small cameras to take pictures
of the sky at different times,"
Marschall said. "We then com
pare pairs of images, looking
for objects that move from one

shot to the next - asteroids.
Once an asteroid, an ir
regular chunk of rock, is iden
tified, the Asteroid Patrol relies
upon software developed by
Glenn Snyder, a research asso
ciate/programmer at the Col
lege, to determine its location.
Snyder's software displays a
chart of the star field around
the asteroid by calling up posi
tions of stars for a reference
catalog. By identifying at least
three reference stars from the
catalog with stars in the pho
tos, the software can then de
termine the astronomical coor
dinates of the asteroid.
In addition to discovering
the asteroids, Marschall and his
students determine the coordi¬

nates of already known aster
oids; this data helps astrono
meis refine their predictions of
where the asteroid will be in
the future.
Marschall and his stu
dents then e-mail their findings
to the Minor Planet Center of
the International Astronomical
Union, which is responsible for
collecting, checking, and dis
seminating astronometric ob
servations and orbits for minor
planets and comets.
"Though we haven't
found a doomsday asteroid yet,
we are having a lot of fun and
are contributing to the rapidly
growing knowledge of the
smaller members of the solar
system," said Marschall.

Faculty member awarded $80,000 grant to
study plant reproduction

From GCPR
Veronique A.
Delesalle, associate
professor of biol
ogy at Gettysburg
College, has been
awarded an
$80,000 grant
from the National
Science Founda
tion (NSF) to
study the repro
duction patterns of
an annual flower
ing plant.
During the

five-year research
project, Delesalle
will study the
Clarkia species, a
group of annual
flowering plants
found naturally
only on the West
Coast. Delesalle,
along with
Gettysburg Col
lege students act

in California each

Clarkia's flower-

Professor Veronique Delesalle rececntly received a sizable grant from the NSF to study the
reproduction of the Clarkia !

ing season.
"Plants
reproduce in
one of two
ways; out
crossing re
production,
during which
pollen needed for
reproduction enters the
flower from
external
sources, in
cluding in
sects and the
wind; and
selfing repro
duction, dur
ing which the

necessary pollen is pro
duced by the
plant itself,"
Delesalle
said. "Most
flowering
plants, in
cluding the
Clarkia, have
both out
crossing and
selfing spe
c 1 e s . "

Delesalle added. "These spe
cies differ in how they allocate
their resources to the male/fe
male functions of reproduc
tion. The different combina
tions of these resources being
allocated result in variations of
flower size, pollen production,
and seed production in various
species of the same flower."
Delesalle will study each
species of Clarkia. A selected
number of the 44 species will
be transferred to the College's
greenhouse for additional
study during non-flowering
seasons. In the greenhouse,

Delesalle will manipulate the
reproduction process to ob
serve the traits of the resulting
plants.
Delesalle joined
Gettysburg College in 1993 fol
lowing faculty positions at
Emory University and Michi
gan State University. She was
a post-doctoral research asso
ciate at Ohio University as part
of a previous NSF grant. She
earned her bachelor's and
master's degrees from McGill
University in Montreal and her
doctorate in ecology and evo
lutionary biology from the Uni
versity of Arizona.

The recycling saga continues as Gettysburg
strives to conserve

By _Kristine Meier
Staff Writer
Walking down the halls
of dorms, housing and campus
buildings the past few weeks ,
you probably noticed a lot of
white boxes along with many
green and white containers.
These are for recycling, an idea
that was put into action by
Emily Celano ('00) and the Re
cycling Taskforce here on cam
pus. "Like anything, the easier
you make it [recycling] for
people, the more they are in
clined to utilize it," said Tina
Grim, Program Manager at the
Civil War Institute. Celano re
searched and visited many col
leges and universities this past
summer with the Recycling

Taskforce, which was formed
this past spring. They decided
that having the various types of
containers was something that
would promote recycling here
at Gettysburg.
The white boxes can be
found in campus administrative
buildings and other offices
along with some student hous
ing. The green containers pro
vided for each dorm room were
purchased from Rubbermaid,
while the white containers were
bought from Turkey Hill Com
pany because they were going
to be thrown away.
"We thought it would be
a good idea to help close the
recycling loop," said Celano.
This is the first year for
all administrative, faculty and
supports staff desks to have re
cycling containers by each desk.

They are in all of the dorms and
regular campus housing. Other
types of housing like fraterni
ties for example, have either
the containers or a large white
box for recycling.
The green containers are
for paper, while the white con
tainers are for other co-mingled
recyclables including plastic
bottles and aluminum cans.
Additional information outlin
ing what can be recycled can
be found on the containers
themselves, in flyers handed
out prior to their distribution,
and on signs hanging up
throughout campus.
The contents of the con
tainers can be discarded in the
first floor lobbies of each dorm.
Housekeeping picks up the re
cyclable material from the
various buildings, offices and

dorms around campus. The
materials are then taken to a
dumpster behind West Build
ing. The main goal is to have
a recycling center behind the
Facilities Services of the West
Building, according to Celano.
Students could then drop off
additional materials. She also
mentioned that an on-campus
composting site next to the
Dining Hall is one of the next
hopes for promoting recycling.
The other is a "reuse room" for
reusable furniture and other
items that would be especially
useful at move out time.

But for now, "our future
plan is to get this program solid
and everyone comfortable with
it," said Celano, (referring to
the recycling containers.)
"I feel that recycling is
great and it is a shame that not
everyone does it," said Chris
Foehl ('03).
Gettysburg is at the top
of many lists, and with campus
recycling going at its current
rate, it will soon be added.
If anyone did not receive
these containers or has any
questions, Celano can be con
tacted by e-mail at
s378612@gettysburg.edu.

Gettysburg College students off to battle... again

by Tim Orr
Contributing Writer
The 26th Pennsylvania was in rare
form. Following a painful wound in the
right arm that made him let out a
mournful scream, my corporal, Andrew
Dangel, threw Private Tom Leupold
over his shoulder, and, in a fireman's
carry, bore him from the fields of battle
to a waiting, makeshift
field hospital where sev
eral of the 26th's ladies . i
of the sanitary commis
sion treated their
ghastly wounds. Mean
while, in the field, the
rest of the 26th put up _^_k

a stubborn defense
against the advancing
Confederate battlehnes
while the 26th's hospi
tal steward, David
Wiseman, valiantly left
his post to treat the
wounded from both
sides during the on
slaught.
I, meanwhile,
limped from the fields
of battle with a wound
to the head and right

The Twenty -Sixth Pennsylavama Emerqency Milita Reqiment enjoys a moment of peace

knee using my enfield rifle as a crutch.
I approached a random spectator and
handed him a blood-spattered letter that
I had written to my parents and other
loved ones back home. I asked the indi
vidual to mail the letter to my parents
and inform them that I had done my
solemn duty in battle. I attempted to
stagger off but collapsed from my
wounds. The crowd watched in horror
as I convulsed in violent death throes.
Afterwards, I was taken to the field hos
pital where I was given my last rites
shortly before succumbing to my battle
wounds. Overall, Gettysburg College
was well represented while hamming it
up at the 136th Anniversary Reenact
ment of the Battle of Gettysburg.
In all, sixteen Gettysburg College
students made it to at least part of the
two day battle reenactment on the
weekend of September 25th and 26th,
1999. All were members of Gettysburg
College's living history and reenactment
unit, Company A of the 26th Pennsyl
vania Emergency Militia Regiment, and
were depicting either military or civil
ian personnel of the 19th ctntury. It is

fitting that the unit represents the Union
infantry company that was formed in
June 1863 in an immediate response to
the invasion of Pennsylvania by the
Army of Northern Virginia and com
prised 61 students of Gettysburg Col
lege (then Pennsylvania College).
Throughout the two day event
near Bushey Farm, some four miles
southwest of Gettysburg, the unit par

5,000 spectators made their way to
Gettysburg on that weekend to partici
pate in or view the weekends activities.
There were about 500 civilian
reenactors and 1,000 military
reenactors, which allowed for some
awe-inspiring battle scenes.
Although this was the 26th's first
battle reenactment, the 26th has done

The idea for the formation of a
college living history and reenactment
group was conceived back in early 1998
by the unit's founders, Jay Spiese, Ian
Isherwood, and Andrew Dangel. In that
first semester, the fledgling unit was a
mere handful of members with no real

appeared little more than
a home for relocated

you for 30 minutes or more.
They will do some checking

be?" In this week's newspaper,
President Haaland replies.

because I felt that I could bet
ter influence the direction of the
institution in that role. I was
honored and excited to be cho
sen as the President of
Gettysburg College because I
wanted the opportunity to
work with a fine ' up and com
ing' liberal arts college."

Sean Rooney, '02:
"Where is all of our money
going?"
Answer: "It will probably
come as no surprise to you,
Sean, that the largest portion of
the College' s budget goes to the
salaries of the faculty, admin
istrators, and support staff who
teach the courses, run the of
fices, and serve the students'
needs. Another large expense
is the financial aid budget,
which is necessary to assure that
students from all economic
backgrounds have the opportu
nity to learn at Gettysburg Col
lege. The Academic and the
College Life programs also re
ceive a large part of the college

budget. The tmth is that tun
ning a high-quality liberal arts
college is an expensive opera
tion. In fact, the actual cost of
each student's education ex
ceeds the full tuition rate. Gen
erous gifts from alumni and
friends, as well as interest from
the college's endowment, offset
the full tuition cost."
Jaime Fold,'01: "If you
could do one thing to make
yourself moie a pait of student
life, what would you do?"
Answer: "This is a great
question, laime. A college

president's life is filled with
commitments that often take
him or her away from the cam
pus, and my life has been no
exception to that rule. I've
tried, though, over the years to
talk to students whenever pos
sible, to have lunches with stu
dents, and to hold town meet
ings to discuss key issues. These
attempts have had mixed suc
cess. If you, or anyone else,
would like to suggest ways of
getting to know one another
_bettei, I'd be glad to heat your
ideas."
Linda Moses,'00: "Why
don't you leciuit moie students
who don't fit the following de
scription: white, uppei-class,
and from the Noitheast?"

Answer- "/ have two an
swets to _youi question, Linda.
Fust, I would challenge youi
presumption that the vast ma
jouty of out students fit youi
description. It's true that most
of our students are white, and

many come from the mid-At
lantic and the Northeast, but
it's certainly not true that most
are upper-class. Sometimes ap
pearances deceive. In fact, more
than 50% of Gettysburg Col
lege students are on significant
financial aid, and their families'
profiles would certainly not be
considered upper-class.
But the other answer to
your question is important: We
are making great efforts to di
versify the student body, as well
as the faculty, administration,
and staff of the College. We are
having some success, but the
changes that we see around

campus are subtle,
rather than dra
m at i c .
There are
more stu
dents of
color,
more in
t e r n a -
t ion a I
students,
and more
students
from various
parts of
the coun¬

try and from differing economic
backgrounds now than in the
past. We are by no means sat
isfied that we've achieved our
goals, but we're working hard
to have Gettysburg College bet
ter reflect the complex world for
which we are preparing our stu
dents. Everyone here can help
in this effort by making sure
that our community welcomes
_difference of all kinds."

Letters to the Editor

The right to, live
A fter reading Rick Deutsch's Sep
tember 23 column entitled
"Think Hunting is a Sport? Ask
the Deer," I was ecstatic to finally see
someone have as high a respect for liv
ing beings as I do. However, Jeremy
Kuhar's letter to the editor a week later
greatly angered and saddened me.
Mr. Kuhar noted that humans are
now "the only predator of the deer"
since we killed off all its other natural
predators. What Mr. Kuhar fails to re
alize is that if perhaps humans had not
killed to the point of near- and/or to
tal-extinction in the first place, the
present killing of deer would not be an
issue. If humans were not so unneces
sarily barbaric to begin with, such kill
ings would not have to continue.
Mr. Kuhar claims that the only
reason why Mr. Deutsch is against the
killing of deer is because they are "cute."
Mr. Kuhar feels that deer (as well as
Exercising the right to choose

An opinion was expressed in last
week's Gettysburgiau (Septem
ber 30) that caught the attention
of women on this campus and evoked
anger and resentment among many of
us. We feel as though words and
thoughts were expressed on behalf of
the female population of the student
body that in no way reflect the way we
feel and perceive ourselves.
"Women Still Have Far To Go"
referred to the theme of a social event
and a picture on a t-shirt as "highly de
grading" and "terribly offensive." We
respect the opinion expressed as one
held by some of the students and ad
ministration, but we are writing this let
ter in order to present a different opin
ion - one from knowledgeable partici
pants of the questioned social event.
The writer accepted the presence

mice) should be killed because they are
"dirty, carry disease, and damage prop
erty." I ask you to take a look around,
Mr. Kuhar. Humans, and especially
college students, also are dirty, carry
disease, and damage property. Accord
ing to Mr. Kuhar's theory, a large num
ber of our fellow Gettysburg students
then must also be killed off.
Finally, Mr. Kuhar argues that the
killing of deer to prevent starvation is
humane and that we should not neglect
them just as we would not neglect
people. Following this theory, Mr.
Kuhar is saying that we should then kill
off all starving people, just to be hu
mane. How much sense does this
make?!? All living beings should be held in
the high respect - mice, deer, and col
lege students all the same. You be care
ful, Mr. Kuhar - you may come back as
a deer in your next life.

With the so-called "Reading Days" almost upon usHt's hard to
believe that yet another semester is nearly half complete. In liejj 'of our)
usual sarcastic comments and campus observations, this week Con
sider This offers you a few suggestions on how to slow down the re
lentless pace of the school year.
1. Get up earlier! Don't do work, though, but have breakfast with
your friends, watch a sunrise or simply take a walk. Spend one day not
rolling out of bed five minutes before class.

ductivity, but make sure you vary your routines
enough to enjoy school and life.
So if you aren't lucky enough to have a ride home or a ticket to
somewhere more exciting this weekend, don't spend all four days in
front of the TV. Explore the town, go to the Apple Harvest Festival, and
most importantly, do something to break through the wall of negative
stereotypes dividing this campus from the town whose zip code we
share.

2. Go somewhere on the weekend be
sides Servo or the CUB. Get tickets to a foot
ball game, or a concert. Break the normal
weekend habit of oversleeping, and under
working. Make a conscious decision to defer
homework, and spend the free time well.
3. Take a battlefield tour. A surprising num
ber of students at this college probably know
very little about the important Civil War battle
fought here. Take a day and learn about our
history, so we can tell the rest of the country
with confidence that Gettysburg is not in Vir
ginia. 4. Spend part of the weekend doing work
for the upcoming week so weekdays don't be
come so tedious. Mondays can actually be en
joyable if you have nothing left to do after
classes.
5. Do something completely random. Dis
cover unknown parts of campus buildings, go
to a new restaurant in town or even take a drive

around the surrounding countryside. Life is too
short to spend every day doing the same thing.
In general, the point is to make each day
as unique as possible so they don't blend to
gether in a blob of work and over-tiredness.
College only takes four years of life; it takes a
lot to make the time go slowly enough to be
enjoyable. Following a routine is good for pro-

Open _lifes, Open tars Insider's Info: The Bullet Hole

by Rick Deutsh
Columnist
All writers know that not
every piece they write is going
to win awards. What do you
think Michael Crichton was
thinking when he wrote The
Lost World } Actually, it was
probably something to the ef
fect of "Damn, I could buy four
more houses with that."
Needless to say, I couldn't
buy my mom a new doormat
with the profit this article will
make me, however, I do believe

that when all else fails, when
you've nothing dynamic to say
about the state of the world,
, or
the state in which you A
live, you can at least M
entertain. W.'

In three years
here, I have
found some
common of .
stranas or interest
the student body.

among
For ex
ample, drinking games, sex,
and the J. Crew catalog all
come to mind as areas of im
portance for the average
Gettysburg student, and I
am proud to say I take a
vested interest in all three.
And for all the inter
est they have generated and
ears they have perked, there is
one other topic that has
brought awe and wonder to the
faces of the young like I haven't
seen since Saved By The Bell
started airing every
weekday...The Bullet Hole.
Only recently have I dis
covered, in social situations
outside of the Bullet Hole, how
fascinated most people are with
all facets of its operation, and
lets face it, so are you. So let
me tell you, as a veteran Cafe
101 staffer of three years, some
things you may not have
known about the Bullet Hole,
but always wanted to know:

-The chicken breast, my
friends, takes a long time to
cook because it goes through a
series of cookings before you

throw lettuce and tomato on it
at "the front line" (that's in
sider talk). First, because
they're frozen, they need to be
warmed once through the top
oven: elapsed time, one minute
and 20 seconds. Then, it gets
put by itself through the bot
tom oven where the majority
of the cooking is done: elapsed
time 5 minutes and 30 seconds.
Finally, it goes through the top
oven for a second time, only
this time with the cheese and
bread: elapsed time, another 1
minute
anri ^^^^^^^_fc^—

"If you're feeling
frisky, give the pizza
a shot"
20 seconds, for a total of nearly
10 minutes. Why can't you just
put the cheese on it through the
bottom oven and save a couple
of minutes? Because the cheese
could never stand to be at tem
peratures that high for that
long and would burn right off.
Amazing, right?
-If you haven't tried the
new pizza, you really should.
They changed pizza crusts (we
now get them from Elios, who
also make those great frozen
pizzas) and it's made all the dif
ference. It's very soft now,
reminiscent of Dominos Deep
Dish, and I'd almost go as far
as to say that it is the slightest
bit Pizza Hut-esque. Don't go
crazy, by all means, eat your
pizza bagels and TBLTs on a
regular schedule for nutrients

and vitamins, but if you're feel
ing frisky, give the pizza a shot.
-If you come in and
there's no soup, unfortunately
the chances are, and I hate to
say it "No soup for you." Soup
is another one of those items
that just takes a while to cook.
If you happen to be the one that
discovers that there's none left,
unless you're willing to stick
around for 20 minutes or so, it
just wasn't meant to be. By the
way, if you don't have any plans
for the night, try the Seven
Bean soup...it's surprisingly
good.

-If you notice that
_^^ the weekly specials are
~^_k a bsent from this
year's menu, it is
_?_f because the man
| _^^^ ager who worked
^^^ on that has very re
cently changed jobs. He
had some very creative

items and he's sorely missed by
all, especially those of you who
liked to stray from the
chicken breasts and
quesadillas on occasion.
-The coffee cart, which
proudly serves Starbucks
coffee at a fraction of the
chain's astronomical costs,
has been on a bit of a hia
tus, but you'll be glad to
know that more people are
being added to work there. It's
open most nights now so keep
your eye open for it.
-Finally, I should inform
you that if you like Mexican

and can't afford Lupita's every
night, upstairs at the Bullet
Hole from Monday through
Thursday from 5:30-6:30,
Casa Ortega is proudly open
for business. Casa Ortega cov
ers the basics in Mexican food,
with nachos, tacos_, and Mexi
can lasagna served nightly.
There are also refried beans
and Santa Fe chicken in an oth
erwise fixed menu. It's usually
next to empty, and serves as a
nice alternative to waiting in a
twenty-minute line.
Unfortunately, the en
lightenment ends here. Maybe
I'll get a call requesting a se¬

quel, and that's when the cash
starts flowing. But it's never
been about that for me, or for
the Bullet Hole. That's just not
a Bullet Hole mentality. It's
about providing the students
with a place where they can
relax and sink their teeth into
a soft, cheesy pizza bagel and
escape into a world where their

are no exams, papers, or
classes. It's about the excite
ment you get when you hear
your number called. And it's
about keeping you coming back
and ordering the same three
things every time because you
just can't get enough of the
damn place. Because, be hon
est, you love the Bullet Hole.

Good clean thoughts ...
fresh from the shower

byJeph McGowan
First Year Columnist
I got to thinking in the
shower, while staring out the
wide-open window at the
slowly turning leaves on an ab
solutely frigid morning a
couple of days ago, while I was
half awake and still half dream
ing, that I'm kind of getting
puzzled by this great big conun
drum that happens to be my
life. I'm wondering about ev
erything now, only because
there's nothing much else to do
there. Important issues, like
which pants to wear and if the
universe is just some clock tick
ing away the seconds.

you feel on the one single day
in the heat wave when the air
conditioner breaks; you know
how valuable it is then.
I think about what it
would be like if I hadn't come
here, if by some complete
oddball chance I chose some
where else and moved up there.
Who would I meet? What
would I be doing? Would the
breakfast be this good?
So many interesting

things have been going on
lately that just can't be com
plete chance. You have to be
lieve, sometimes anyway, that
some occurrences are past ran
dom and are playing them
selves out according to some
pre-written script that no one,
no matter how much they want
it, has the copy of. This was
about the time I dropped the
entire shower caddy on the

in complete coincidence or not,
it's still a little bit spooky some-

I wore jeans, by the way,
but only after I dried off. Get
ting dressed in the shower is
not, and should not be consid
ered, a good idea.
I'd like to think, at least
for my sake, that this whole
enchilada isn't just some mega
jumble of completely random
events playing themselves out
in near isolation. That's just
what I hope, though.
The things that were
meant to happen, not just the
things that do happen, are quite
special when you get right back
down to it. Like people who
change your life forever in
some amazing way and make
you wonder how you could
ever function without them;
almost in the same way that

times. I'm finally getting settled
in, and getting all my difficul
ties ironed out. I owe much of
this to the dynamic duo down
stairs in the room next to the
trash room. Both of them have
been lending their ears, they've
been quite helpful, and for that
I thank them muchly.
All settled in, just in time
to leave for the weekend. As
much as I like it here, the trip
home is going to be a wonder
ful little vacation. And won

Two weeks ago the cover
of this prestigious newspaper
was the subject of much debate
after the issue of tcwn/campus
violence was raised. The recent
string of attacks has adminis
trators perplexed, students
afraid to walk alone, and the

very surroundings?
When I was living in Lon
don, I can't remember ever
feeling truly afraid of my sur
roundings. There I was a for
eigner, living in a pretty bad
area, and walking the streets of
one of the largest cities in the
world. I can honestly tell you,
though, that after hearing
about the last three attacks, and
after hearing more stories from

townspeople and college stu
dents alike, that I am now ques
tioning my surroundings based
upon a primal fear of insecu
rity. I find this fact striking. In
addition, after conversations
with my peers who live adja
cent to the campus community
I find it striking that as a result
of these attacks campus escorts
are being utilized and that stu
dents are actually watching
their backs in case of assault.
It would be easy if we
could just pass all of our blame
to Safety & Security. It would
be just as easy to blame these
assaults on the work of
drunken rebellious college stu
dents. The fact of the matter
is that these assaults have been
random acts of violence per
formed by local youths against
our friends and neighbors.
This is what makes these at
tacks so frightening. That de
spite proactive measures like
lights, call phones, and patrols
the situation has gotten worse.
Safety & Security has tried for
years to be more proactive so
that we as a community feel
safe and comfortable. The
simple fact is that no matter
how many people we hire, or
how many measures we take,
these occurrences will happen.
What changes the situation is
the fact that these instances
have increased significantly
over the last few years. Cam
pus security has not become
worse, in fact it has become
better. The assailants involved
are attacking students who are,
or live, relatively off campus.
It is a classic example of town
verses campus hostility but in
stead of exchanging words or
dirty snares, fists are now the
approved method of venting
this tension.
What is the solution?
Well, we all wish that we knew
the answer to that question. I
think a fundamental problem is
a lack of communication be
tween the Borough and the stu
dent body. In any discussion
the administration has about
these issues, the Borough po¬

lice need to be involved because
these instances are still within
their jurisdiction. In addition,
we are a significant part of the
population of this town; for
nine months of the year we
have a voice and our protection
is just as important as that of
your average resident. We all
have to live together in this
charmingly quaint town and
the Borough police, as well as
campus security, are respon
sible for protecting and serving
our needs.
I think the college com
munity can also have a serious
impact on Gettysburg culture.
We have such a wide base of
talent, and in addition, we have
service organizations that actu
ally do help, or have the po
tential to help, the community.
Since most of these assaults
were by Gettysburg youths,
then maybe we need to bridge
the communication gap be
tween the youths of this town
and ourselves. We are not all
stereotypes.
The closing of Majestic
Theatre is a very sad thing be
cause by closing a center of lo
cal entertainment, you are in
fact limiting the options of lo
cal young adults even further.
Just look at the local Citgo sta
tion after 9p.m. on Friday and
you'll see Gettysburg High
School's finest meeting and
cruising through. I charge our
service organizations to inves
tigate proactive ways to help
our community at large to
hopefully discourage violence
and to cut down the powerful
and unjust barriers which ste
reotypes can create. They
don't interact with us, and
largely, we don't interact with
them. The safe distance we
have created within our own
comfort zone is in fact coming
back to haunt us.
As residents of this small
community we all need to work
together to solve these issues.
It is not a College problem, it
is a cultural problem affecting

The Apple Harvest Festival: not just for
locals anymore

by Brent LaRosa
Contributing Writer
When the average stu
dent talks about Gettysburg
College, the usual complaint
that there is just not enough
do in this little town to sustain
the active social life of a col
lege student. Well, I can tell
you from personal experience,
that is not true.
"But I am not a Civil War
buff!" you exclaim. Answers
like that tell me that you are
just looking for an excuse to
live your lives in an alcoholic
haze, because that is all you can
do to fend off boredom in Get
tysburg, right? Wrong. You do
not have to be a Civil War en
thusiast, a jock, Greek, or oth
erwise to find stimulating ac
tivities in the area. Heck, for
most of the exciting events held
in the area, you do not even
need a car.

The Gettysburg area of
fers hundreds of events every
month that range from ball
room dancing lessons to live
jazz to art festivals. All you
have to do is get off your duff
(a hard suggestion, to be sure,
but a worthwhile one).
Case in point: the Apple
Harvest Festival. For a nomi
nal price, you and your friends
can spend the day amidst the
"local folk" and love every
minute of it. At the South
Mountain Fairgrounds about
ten minutes from downtown

- Gettysburg, local harvesters
hold a fair on the first two
weekends in October. It is a
county fair style event, only
u- with an apple theme_,
rg You can find everything
is you could want that has to do
to with apple, including some of
in the best apple pie I have ever

had (and some things that are
scary, like apple sausage). Also
throw in rows and rows of lo
cal merchants, Indian dancers_,
hay rides, and some of the bes.
BBQ in the state.
Now, I know you are all
thinking about the "mingling
with the locals" factor. I bet
some of the snobby ones of you
out there are saying "Why
would I want to do something
like that? I may get my SAAB
dirty!" Well, get off your so
cial high horse. I bet that your
town from home has things like
this all the time (even in New
Jersey!).
And yet, with all of the
advertising and publicity the

event gets, there are relatively
few college students who at
tend. It is like pulling teeth to
get people to participate in
community events. I am dis
appointed when I talk to
people from the town who
know so little about the student
body outside of the drinking
and the snobby out-of-staters
(that's right I'm talking to
you!). How much have you
missed in your time here?
What have you done in college?
You do not go to school in Get
tysburg unless you actually go
into the town (and I don't mean
just walking up to the Pub).
So, as for the line "there's
nothing to do here," I do not
want to hear it.

There is plenty to do here
outside of the battlefield (al
though you should go on a tour
at least once in four years).
And, hopefully at least one of
you will read this and go to the
tourist center at the old train
station next to Majestic and
pick up a community events
calendar. They are published
monthly, contain the major
events happening in the area,
and, best of all, they are free.
Get your butt out of bed,
put that can of Natural Light
down, put off that term paper
one more day, and get into your
college experience. After all,
what is more depressing about
your college memories than not
having any? Try it, you may
just have fun.

r _« Janet Reno and the
Department of Injustice

BY DAN BALLENTYNh
Columnist
In George Orwell's novel
1984, the ministry that was re
sponsible for the prosecution of
the perpetual wars between the
superstates was called, in
Newspeak, the Ministry of
Peace. In 1999, the Newspeak
analogy is applicable to the Jus
tice Department of Janet Reno.
The Campaign Finance Inves
tigation, the Chinagate Inves
tigation, and I'm sure many
others have been tampered
with, sent into disarray, or out
right dropped by this depart
ment of "justice."
The purpose of the Jus
tice Department is to enforce
the laws of this country. In re
gards to both Campaign Fi
nance and Chinagate, the up
per levels of the Justice Depart
ment have failed, deliberately,
in their duty.

Let us first turn our atten
tion to the White House cell
phone scandal. To refresh your
memory, the President and
Vice-President were accused of
raising campaign funds on fed
eral property using cell phones.
This scandal grew to include
the White House teas with the
campaign contributors, usually
Chinese. Now, to be clear, it is
ILLEGAL to raise ANY sort of
campaign funds, even soft
money, on federal property.
Despite having the teas on
_Stapes and other evidence, Janet
Reno's Justice Department re
fused to appoint an Indepen
dent Counsel, a serious mistake
at best, corruption and protec
tion at worst.

Next let's move to the
Buddhist Temple fiasco con
cerning Vice-President Al Gore.
This is the scandal where the
Vice-President attended a
fundraiser at a Buddhist temple
in California. Again, to be
clear, it is ILLEGAL for ANY
political fundraising to be done
on religious property or for
ANY political donations to be

made by a religious organiza
tion. The US Attorney respon
sible for the area where the
Buddhist temple is located be
gan an investigation into the
Buddhist Temple affair. The US
Attorney was contacted by a
lieutenant of Janet Reno who
informed the him that he was
to send his evidence to Wash
ington because it was a matter
for an Independent Counsel.
However, this DOJ man was
advising Janet Reno against an
Independent Counsel, and that
Janet Reno was leaning toward
NOT appointing an Indepen
dent Counsel. This incident in

and of itself smacks of corrup
tion and protection.
Also, Janet Reno has not
cooperated with any investiga
tions in Congress. She has re
fused to turn over materials
subpoenaed by Congress, espe
cially by Rep. Dan Burton's
House Government Affairs
committee. This went on to the
point that the only thing that
saved her from a Contempt of
Congress citation was that she
collapsed in church the Sunday
before the vote was to take
place, and it was decided that
it would be a bad move politi
cally to cite her then.

It needs to be said that
not everybody in the DOJ is
responsible for the terrible cor
ruption going on there. FBI
Director Louis Freeh has been
very cooperative with Congress
and has been vigorous in his
own investigations, despite lack
of cooperation from the DOJ.
We also need to look at
the deals that were cut with five
of the main figures of the Cam
paign Finance Scandals. All
five of them, including John
Huang, Johnny Chung, and
Charlie Trie, were given very
light sentences (probation,
community service, etc.) and
not asked to cooperate with
ongoing investigations. So far,
only Johnny Chung has volun
teered information to the FBI,
and told what he knows to the
American people in an exclu¬

sive interview with Fox News's
Bill O'Reilly, which can be seen
at http://www.foxnews.com/
oreilly. The DOJ has essentially
closed the case despite all this
evidence and all the evidence
that can be provided by these
people and others.
Finally, there are the
DOJ's failures in the Chinagate
scandal. We will specifically be
looking at the case of Wen Ho
Lee. Wen Ho Lee was an em
ployee of the Los Alamos
Nuclear Weapons Laboratory.
After an exemplary investiga
tion by the Department of
Energy's Counterlntelhgence
division headed by Notra
Trulock uncovered evidence of

espionage committed by Mr.
Lee, they enlisted the help of
the FBI. The FBI asked per
mission to wiretap Mr. Lee's
computer with more than
enough evidence to do so.
Despite that fact, and the fact
that it was a national security
matter, the DOJ refused the
wiretap twice, the only two
times a wiretap was refused in
1997. Also, the Attorney Gen
eral neglected to inform the
FBI that Mr. Lee had signed a
waiver when he went to work
for Los Alamos that stated that
there was no need for a war
rant to wiretap him. Further
more the DOJ has hinted that
it will not charge Mr. Lee with

espionage.
There are more to these
scandals -crimes, even- than I
have said here. I could go on,
but it would end up as a book
on the subject. But what has
been said here makes it clear.
There is high level corruption
at the DOJ. I would like to
commend FBI Director Louis
Freeh and Notra Trulock for
doing their duties as patriotic
and loyal Americans. I will also
call for the resignation or im
peachment of Attorney General
Janet Reno and her closest
deputies. They are either cor
rupt, incompetent, or both, and
must go for the good of the
United States.

Women's Lib
marches on

by Rachel Hanson
Columnist
Last Thursday I was given
the esteemed honor of dining
with Ms. Norma Swenson, one
of the original founders of the
Boston Women's Health Book
Collective, which published
Our Bodies, Ourselves. Ms.
Swenson also gave a lecture to
many members of the College
community in the Lyceum of
Pennsylvania Hall.
Reflecting on the things I

discussed with Ms.
and the topics she
spoke about, I realize
how far the medical
community has come
in the area of
women's health and
how far we as a soci
ety still have to go.

Swenson

Research on
and knowledge about heath is
sues pertaining to women has
come very far. We are currently
in the midst of Breast Cancer
Awareness Month, a phenom
enon that would not have ex
isted 25 years ago. Pregnancy
and giving birth is one of the
safest medical procedures
women can now go through.
Contraceptives are widely
available and abortion has fi
nally been made legal.
However, as I have said
before, there is still much
progress that needs to be made.
First of all, these wonderful
advances in medical technology
are for the most part only avail
able to Western women.
Women in poorer, nonWestern
("Third World") countries still
know relatively little about
their own bodies and face great
medical dangers on a daily ba¬

sis. Health insurance cover
age is another major impedi
ment in attaining proper care
for women. Many policies do
not cover pregnancy because
not everyone (namely men) will
get pregnant, and it is argued
that it would be unfair to
charge people for coverage
they cannot take advantage of.

Another problem with health
insurance is the fact that many
plans now allow only a 24-hour
hospital stay after giving birth.
This is not nearly enough time
to recover from such a major
trauma to a woman's body.
Women have also seen
access to legal abortions come
under repeated attack since
1973. Government acts like
the Hyde Amendment make it
so that lower-class women
(who are usually also minority
women) do not have the access
they should to abortion.
Thus, it has become a

freedom for middle
and upper class (white)
women alone. We
need to make it so that
any woman, regardless
of her economic posi
tion, can get a safe
abortion if she needs

one.
Finally, our society needs
to be changed so that women
will be free to discuss "taboo"
subjects. I will never forget the
shock of a female friend when
she heard two other female
friends and I discussing men
struation in public. Why must
she be shocked? Every woman
goes through it, and if we did
not, no more people would be
born. It is as natural a func
tion as blowing your nose, and
yet women are not supposed to
talk about it.
The same is true for any
topic related to sexuality. So
ciety says that only men mas
turbate and if women are devi
ant enough to also do so, they
simply are not supposed to talk
about it. Homosexuality is an
other area that should be al
lowed to be discussed more
openly. As it is now, you can
be gay, but just don't talk about
lesbian lifestyles (both sex-ori
ented and not).

It is very important that
women's health issues be
brought back to the forefront
of the women's movement.
They have not yet all been dealt
with and it is necessary to do
so for the full advancement of
women.

the Pachyderm's Pulpit
Reform's party just about over

by John Dunlap
Political Columnist
From the founding of the
American Republic, the two
party political system has been
ingrained in United States po
litical culture. Beginning with
the debate over the ratification
of the Constitution with the
Federalists and Anti-Federal
ists, two sides of the ideologi
cal spectrum have squared off
against one another.
While the Constitution
makes no mention of political
parties and our first President
George Washington eschewed
political factions, it was under
Washington's Cabinet that the
Democrat-Republicans led by
Thomas Jefferson and the Fed
eralists led by Alexander
system that has survived
through today. With very few
exceptions the American sys
tem has been a unique two
party system.

When the Federalist Party
died during James Monroe's
tenure, the United States would
see Monroe re-elected almost
unanimously in 1820, and in
1824 the Presidential race was
fought along sectional lines.
The rise of Andrew Jackson
brought about the second
American party system as the
Whigs and the Democrats
dominated American politics.
When the Whig Party died in
the 1850s, the Republicans
picked up the pieces and two
party system that exists today

was born.
Throughout our history,
third parties have risen and
died just as quickly as they were
born. Third parties have his
torically formed during times
of discontent and when the two
major parties are not address
ing an important issue. This
occurred during the turn of the
last century when the Populist
Party was formed due to the
anger of farmers at the big busi
ness that controlled govern
ment and industry. Their ideas
where soon ingrained into both
the Democratic Party with Wil¬

liam Jennings Bryan and the
Republican Party with
Theodore Roosevelt.
Roosevelt, himself a former
President, in 1912 bolted from
the Republican Party to run
with California Governor
Hiram Johnson on the Progres
sive Party ticket where they fm
ished behind the winner,
Democratic Governor
Woodrow Wilson of New Jer
sey, and ahead of incumbent
Republican President William
Howard Taft.
Today, another third
party has em¬

erged,
and like
past third

arose because the _V
two major parties _^
were not addressing
the economic con
cerns of the voters. In
the 1 992 Presidential

election, businessman H.
Ross Perot was able to garner
19% of the vote, the greatest
popular support since
Theodore Roosevelt in 1912.
Hoping to build on his support
Perot formed the Reform Party
in 1992, and with federal
matching funds, was his party's
nominee for President in 1996,
where he received under 10%
of the vote.
The question for Reform

now is whether it will be able
to emerge and join the two
major parties as a mainstay in
American politics or if it is des
tined to fade away like its third
party forbearers. It is my be
lief that Reform will go the way
all third parties will go. Reform
was born out of a desire to bal
ance the budget and get the
economy moving. Today,
thanks to the Republicans in
Congress, the budget has been
balanced and the economy is
growing. It is now hard for Re
form to make its arguments and
agenda clear for the American
people.

An even
more press
i n g
con
cern
f o r
R e -
form
is the
divi
sion
within

l t s
party leadership. Reform's
only statewide elected official,
Governor Jesse Ventura of
Minnesota, a former Navy Seal
and professional wrestler,
wants Reform to stay out of
social issues, but with Pat
Buchanan possibly joining the
party that will not be possible.
Ventura has made it clear
that he does not support the
social conservative Buchanan

and that he supports New York
businessman, Donald Trump
for the party's nomination.
Ventura's recent remarks to
Playboy magazine that he be
lieves organized religion is for
the weak do not bode well for
party unity. The Minnesota
Governor is the party's most
popular figure and if he be
comes a joke like Mr. Perot,
then the death of the party
could come a lot earlier than
either would like it.
Beyond social issues,
Buchanan and the party
founder, Ross Perot believe in
economic nationalism. They
are protectionist and in a world
economy in the next millen
nium their economic formula
is a recipe for disaster. Reform
needs a permanent niche where
it can stand, and with such col
orful characters as Perot,
Ventura, and potentially
Buchanan, the party is headed
in a direction of disarray.

The potential downfall of
the Reform Party does not
bother me at all. While I do
think that the struggle inside
this top-down party is interest
ing, I like our two party system.
We do have a diversity of opin
ion and that is voiced in pri
maries. The idea that someone
who cannot win their own
party's nomination would just
bolt to a third partv is wrong.
You should work within to help
shape your party, but if Mr.
Buchanan wants to go, then
fine, it will probably be best for

We realized the region is wide
open and we've got a chance
to do some good things."
You have to remember, as
sophomore Bryan Brander put
it, "That conferences and
regionals are coming up soon.
Keeping focused on those
meets keeps us motivated."

So never mind the fact
that juniors Jason Rose and
Jonathon Catlett, sophomore
Devin Odom, Gary and fellow
senior Brian Holden, sopho
more Evan Merkhofer, fresh
man Dan Campion, and sopho
more Chuck Milbert rounded
out the top eight spots for the
men. Forget about sophomore
Kristin Roberts finishing first
for the Bullets, followed by
freshman Melissa Holman,
sophomore Lauren Davis, jun
iors Kim Heimerl and Kelley

Lord, sophomore Janel Farrell,
junior Kristin Mills,and fresh
man Allison Small.
Shake things up, come
out and support the teams (two
more home meets, October 23
and 30), and watch this space
for some real reporting in the
near future.
Oh, and by the way, if this
article seemed to lose focus,
just remember: it's midseason.

Women s soccer nets win
Frankford named CC Player of the Week after sudden death goal

by Kristin Roberts
Staff Writer
Last Wednesday was an
exciting day for the Gettysburg
women's soccer team. They
played an outstanding game,
defeating Muhlenberg College
2-1 in overtime.
This game improved the
Bullets' Centennial Conference
record to 3-0, while the Muhls
dropped to 2-2. The Bullets
have now won 12 conference
games in a row.
Muhlenberg was a tough
team to oppose; they have a
number of talented and danger
ous players.
Despite this, the Bullets
played well and their shooting
improved, allowing them to
create many scoring opportu
nities. The Mule's goalie was
skilled and made some great
saves.

The head-to-head game
was scoreless until the 29th
minute. Senior captain Amy
Brewster changed that status
with one of the team's nicest
goals of the year. On an assist
by sophomore Leslie Sloper,
Brewster slipped behind the
defense to put a long ball into
the back of the net.
The Bullets held off all

Mule scoring opportunites
with a solid defense led by se
nior Lauren Frankford.
Head Coach Todd
Wawrousek has tried adjusting
the positioning of players,
while sticking with the same
basic formation. Goalie Erin
Hayden recorded four saves to
the defensive effort.
Muhlenberg tied the
game near the end of the sec
ond half, on a controversial
penalty kick that got by
Hayden.
Regular play ended in a
tie, so the conference foes ven
tured into overtime.
Wawrousek said the Bullets
"turned it up a notch in over
time." Only five minutes into
the extra session, Lauren
Frankford broke the tie on a
long run.

Frankford, who was
named Centennial Conference
Player of the Week, scored the
game winning goal on a 35
yard shot that sailed over the
goalie's head.
"Maureen McBrien made
a good pass back to me and I
gave it a shot," said Frankford.
"We're happy about the
win," she continued. "We can't
afford to lose or tie. We want
to keep our fate in our hands."

Sophomore Taryn
Chomik barely missed the net
on a breakaway. Freshman
Julia Girman's header from six
yards was stopped by the
Muhlenberg goalie. The goalie

also blocked
a nice shot by
Jill Piekarski
that re
bounded off
of the far
post.
Wawrousek
was satisfied
with the out
come of
Wednesday's
game. "It
was a key
Conference
game; we
needed to
win," he
said. Satur
day was not a
good day for
the Bullets.
They were
defeated by
The College
of New Jer
sey, the num
ber one
ranked team
in the nation.
T.C.N.J. was

simply a better team, and
outplayed the Bullets. How
ever, they are not unbeatable,
according to Wawrousek.
Wawrousek was disap
pointed in the Bullets' play this

game. "They had anxiety
about playing on turf, which
you could see in practice on
Friday," he said.
"They were out of the
game in their minds."
He sees this fear as a mar
gin for growth, though. Once
the Bullets got accustomed to
the new playing surface, they
began to create opportunities
in the second half. Wawrousek
was pleased that the women
could do this against a good
team. The Bullets will have an
opportunity to practice on in
door turf before competing at
Johns Hopkins' artificial turf
field. Opponents this week are
Dickinson, a Conference team,
and Moravian. The contest
with Dickinson is a hard one
to predict, but Gettysburg must
be prepared to score against a
competitive team.

Moravian will also pose
a challenge to the Bullets; they
will be comparable to
Muhlenberg.
Although the loss to
TCNJ was rather discouraging,
it does not overshadow the vic
tory over Muhlenberg. The
conference games are the most
important. The Bullets are
ready to tak_^'jon the rest of the
Centennial _conference teams.

From Gettysburg Times

With his team's leading
rusher sidelined due to injury,
Johns Hopkins reserve running
back Scott Martorana rushed
for a career-high 160 yards and
three touchdowns to lead the
Blue Jays (3-1, 2-0 Centennial
Conference) past Gettysburg,
37-13, Saturday. With the loss,
the Bullets dropped to 1-4

Field hockey remains undefeated at 11-0
Lady Bullets defeat long time rival, ranked #4 in the nation

by Lisa Beideman
Staff Writ er
Last week brought two
more wins to the women's field
hockey team's perfect season.
The team stands 5-0 in
the Centennial Conference and
11-0 overall.
They have also managed
to earn their 4th place national
ranking outright and they are
one of only two teams in the
nation with an undefeated
record.
Senior captain Steph
Fisher commented on the
team's 11-0 record. "It's a
great feeling. The whole team
shares in this excitement. All
our hard work is paying off,"
she said.
"We are happy with our
success and are trying not to do
anything to change that."
With eight games left in
the regular season, the Bullets
are staring an NCAA bid in the
face, but due to a new NCAA
rule, they must win the confer
ence to advance to post season
play. Therefore, every game
the Lady Bullets play is crucial
to their future and their play
certainly reflects this attitude.
On Friday, the Bullets
packed their bags and traveled

five hours to Geneva, New
York to play the No. 13 ranked
William Smith Herons.
The Herons found the
cage first, scoring early in the
first half. The Bullets tied it up
with nine minutes left off of a
penatly stroke scored by first
year defender Carrie Reeve.
At the half, the Bullets
found themselves all even at 1
1. A very intense and high en
ergy second half was 35 min
utes of great hockey, forcing the
game into overtime.
Within two minutes of
the extra session, senior
midfielder Laura DeSario hit
the boards off an assist from
classmate Steph Fisher in a
penatly corner, ending the
game in a 2-1 victory for the
Bullets.
This non-conference con
test marked the first time in
over a decade that the Lady
Bullets have defeated long time
rival William Smith.

Junior goalie Maureen
Giese posted an impressive 10
saves for the team.
Last season, William
Smith advanced to the NCAA
championships, before falling
to Middlebury 3-2.
On Tuesday, Gettyburg
earned their 5th win in the con
ference by defeating Western
Maryland 5-1. Junior Jen

White started the scoring off
midway through the first half
and that is where the scoring
stood at halftime, 1-0, Gettys
burg. In the second half, the
Bullets turned it on and
pumped in four more goals
while allowing only one, to
claim the contest.
Fisher had two goals and
an assist on the game and
White also found the cage once
more in the second half. White
also recorded an assist.
Junior defender Whitney
Walsh's first goal of the season
stunned the Western Maryland
goalie with the third goal of
the game.
Junior defender Megan
Eddinger had a solid defensive
and offensive showing in both
rnn tests

"We didn't play as well as
we would have liked , but it
was a big win for us being a
conference game," said Fisher.
"Every conference game
is pretty big because we'd like
to go undefeated in the confer
ence." Today, the Bullets travel
to F&M to play another con
ference battle before a short
break this weekend.
Next week, they meet Di
vision Ill's first ranked team,
Lebannon Valley, in Annville at
4 p.m.

The Chris Clifford Me
morial Run began at 8:30 with
registration. Over 230 runners
were sponsored for the benefit
of the scholarship in Chris's
name. Brad McCutcheon, one
of the race's organizers, began
the race with a moment of si
lent meditation for Lori Moll

(class of '97), John Taylor (class
of '99), and Clifford himself.
Each of these three
people were former Gettysburg
College athletes that have
passed away since their gradu
ation. The 3.1 mile run began
at 9:30 and the last participant
crossed the line at around
10:30.
Everyone then adjourned
to the quarry where there was
a final ceremony.
Mr. Joe Clifford, Chris's
father, gave a touching speech,
and McCutcheon announced

to the college that approxi
mately 15,000 dollars had been
raised for the scholarship fund.
This more than doubled
the original goal that had been
set forth a month ago. All the
money raised has now been
placed into an annual scholar
ship fund in Chris Clifford's
name. Each year a different first
year student will be chosen by
the Clifford family in conjunc
tion with the college to benefit
from this money.
The recipient will be told

something of the shining char
acter and wonderful person
Chris was and will be expected
to hold true to these same high
ideals.
Thank you to all who
were involved with this run,
but especially to Brad
McCutcheon, Matt Snyder,
and the Clifford family who
organized the race.
Very rarely have I seen a
group of people that size pull
together for such a worthy
cause. I was proud to be a part
of something so special.

Men s soccer enjoys 2-0 week, pushes
unbeaten streak to eight

by Robin Roger
Staff Writer
Despite a scoreless sec
ond half, the Gettysburg men's
soccer team gained another vic
tory over Western Maryland
last Wednesday. The final score
was 3-0 as the Bullets cruised
to their third consecutive shut¬

out. Senior captain Jason
Vishio scored two bookend
goals at 5:30 and 25:00. Vishio
was assissted by senior captain
Jesse Flynn on the first and jun
ior Jeremy Shapiro on the sec
ond. Senior Chris Pryor also
put one in the net at 7:40, as
sisted by Flynn.
The Bullets had difficulty
scoring in the second half, par
tially due to poor field condi
tions. The pitch was torn up
by the end of the contest. Al
though the defense only al
lowed five shots in the game,
they had trouble building out
of the back to assist the offense.
"They were not a bad
team," said Vishio, "but we
jumped on them early and de
moralized them by throwing
early goals into the net."

He said they kept their
opponents on their heels for
the whole game, so that they

couldn't get going offensively.
Junior goaltender Nick
La Porta was pleased with the
solid defensive game the Bul
lets played. When asked about
his fifth posted shutout of the
season, La Porta answered, "I
was stoked, dude!"
The Bullets also took the
Haverford Fords, 4-2 on Sat
urday.
In an impressive feat,
Shapiro scored in the first and
last minutes of the first half. He
took only slightly longer than
30 seconds to score his first
goal on the unprepared Fords'
goalie.
The goal came off a
throw-in, which Vishio flicked
off to Shapiro. Shapiro easily
headed the ball past the keeper.
This first goal gave the
Bullets the momentum they
needed to score three more
goals.

"We haven t been scoring
early, so it helped us," said
Shapiro. Haverford came back
in the 20th minute, with a goal
by Jordan Brown, tying the
game at 1-1.
Gettysburg answered
with two more goals, the first
by Vishio, assisted by freshman
Liam McDevitt in the 40th
minute. Shapiro, assisted again
by Vishio, scored the second

goal in the last second. This
goal put the Fords under.
The Bullets allowed one
more goal by Haverford in the
65th minute, when Richard
Billings worked his way
through four Gettysburg de
fenders.
The damage was already
done, however, and Pryor
scored in the 78th minute, as
sisted by Vishio, to finish off
the Fords.
"They were a decent
team," said Shapiro, "but we
outplayed them."
With this victory, the Bul
lets improved their record to 7
1-2 overall and 3-0-1 in the
conference. This was their
eighth game in an unbeaten
streak.

The Bullets also benefited
from another team's bad luck
this week. Over the weekend,
Hopkins lost to the
Mublenburg Mules, which el
evates the Bullets to the num
ber one slot in the conference
rankings.
During reading days, the
team travels to Rocky Mount,
NC to compete in the North
Carolina Wesleyan Tourney.
The Bullets will face
Swarthmore at home on the

Cross Country runs

It's been what, three or
four weeks since I started writ

it would become this mundane,
this pedestrian? Of course, I'm
not talking about the actual

What I'm talking about is
the actual writing ot the ai tide.
It's a formula, you know? You
