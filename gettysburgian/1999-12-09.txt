News Correspondent
As the semester and
year draw to a close, it's a
good time to review the
events of the last year from
the perspective of human
rights.
A year ago marked the
50th anniversary of the Uni
versal Declaration of Human
Rights (UDHR), This docu
ment arose out of the collec
tive lessons of the second
"World War and a desire to see
them avoided in the future.
On December 10, 1948 the
Declaration was ratified by
48 nations. It is one of the
cornerstones of international
law and the guiding docu
ment tor human rights
groups like Amnesty Interna
tional.

Amnesty: The year in review

In this year, Amnesty
launched a historic campaign
about human rights in the
United States. Normally we
think of our country as one
of the defenders and origina
tors of human rights (and,
indeed, it was Eleanor
Roosevelt who played the key
role in the formulation of the
UDHR). Nevertheless, Am
nesty International felt it im
portant to bring to attention
some areas of concern often
overlooked in this country:
mistreatment of women pris
oners, detention of asylum

seekers, police brutality, biased
use of the death penalty, and
arms transfers to countries with
poor human rights records.
Proceedings against
former Chilean dictator
Augusto Pinochet continued.
He is currently being held in
England, but a ruling in Octo
ber paves the way for his ex
tradition to Spain.

Prosecu
t o r s
claim that the
system
atic "dis
appear-ances"
under his
regime
constitute human rights vio
1 a ti ons
under in
t e r n a -
tional law.
He has
perma
nent im
munity in
his own
country as
a "senator

for life,"
so the question of whether any
nation can try a former head
of state for "international
crimes" (as defined by interna
tional treaties) is extremely im
portant_. As Pinochet's trial con
tinues in the corning year, it is
sure to set precedents.

Months before the out
right conflict there began this
spring, Amnesty reported on
problems in the southern
Serbian province of Kosovo. It
began with a ban on using the
Albanian language in schools
and other small restrictions. It
ended with a display of NATO
military force and widespread

atrocities
on the
part of
Serbian forces
before their
with
drawal.
Cur
rently President Milosevic remains
i n

Belgrade
and op
ponents
can mus
ter only
minimal
support.
Amnesty sent in
vestiga-tors
to
the re
as ta
as _taiung

in April

as well
as weu

gion statements from refugees in
Florida, but also didn't hesitate
to criticize of NATO for going
after and disabling non-military
targets.
The major development
during this fall was the disaster

in East Timor. The area has
been disputed since Indonesia
invaded more than-20 years
ago. So there was great hope
after President Habibie finally
announced East Timor would
be allowed self-determination.
Those hopes faded rapidly
when opponents of indepen
dence reacted to the vote by
terrorizing inhabitants anc
burning villages. Although
many refugees have returned
to their homes to start rebuild
ing, it will take awhile for in
vestigators to piece together
the _details and bring perpetra
tors to trial.
One step to improving
human rights further would
be the ratification of the pro
posed International Criminal
Court. Arms sales and trade
could be linked to improve
ment in governments' treat
ment of their citizens.

But other problems go
deeper and are not so easily
solved. One out of six people
on this planet survive on less
than a dollar a day. Around
35,000 children die each day
because of malnutrition or
preventable disease. And over
30 nations suffer under civil
war or ethnic conflicts. Re
spect for the rights listed in
the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights would not
solve all these problems, but
is one possible step towards
that goal. Remember these
and other issues on Human
Rights Day, December 10,
1999.

The 13-year-old boy who
opened fire on his middle
school classmates used his
father's 9mm semiautomatic
handgun, officials said at a
Tuesday morning news confer
ence. The gun was purchased
at a Wal-Mart.
Meanwhile, President
Clinton, in Washington, said
investigators from the FBI and
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms were on the scene
in Fort Gibson. "Our prayers

Oklahoma shooter used dad's gun

are with each of the children
and their families," Clinton
told reporters.
On Monday, the seventh
grader fired the gun at least 15
times on the campus of Fort
Gibson Middle School, wound
ing four students before he was
subdued by a school teacher.
Police Chief Richard
Slader said the student had
more ammunition available.
The gun was registered to the
youth's father, although it was
not known when it was pur
chased, Slader said.
The boy's name is not

being released, but the news
reports say students at the
school identified the shooter as
Seth Trickey.
The day after the shoot
ing, classes resumed. Many stu
dents who typically ride a bus
to school were brought by their
parents. Local police were on
hand, telling students to enter
to through the bad< doors of
the school.
Officials have said the
boy did not have any previous
record of wrongdoing. He's
been described as a good stu
dent, active in his church and

popular.
Prosecutors cannot
charge the teen as an adult un
less one of his victims dies. On
his victims, a 12-year-old girl,
suffered the worst injury—a
shot to the cheek. She was
listed in fair condition on Tues
day. In addition, a 13-year-old
was treated for a wound to his
forearm and another 13-year
old underwent surgery for a leg
wound. Brad Schindel, 12, was
shot in both arms.
Fort Gibson is 50 miles
southeast of Tulsa.

Knight-Ridder Newspapers
In a poster going up on
college campuses across the
Philadelphia area, the dour
face of an older Asian woman
is displayed in what appears
to be a Gap ad for vests.
Until you read the head
line: "My name is Chie Abad.
I used to work in a GAP sweat
shop."
For a hip retailer trying
to get everyone to wear cords,
sing "Mellow Yellow" and
swing-dance in khakis, that
stings.
But this poster and oth
ers, as well as a coast-to-coast

Anti-sweatshop student groups
fighting Gap, Nike

college speaking tour by Abad,
are the latest salvos in an ex
panding campus crusade
against sweatshops. At more
and more colleges across the
country, students are speaking
out against U.S. companies
such as Nike and Gap that buy
goods from overseas factories.
The anti-sweatshop
groups, which have cropped
up in the last several years, are
trying to draw attention to
low wages and harsh working
conditions. They also are pres
suring universities to stop li
censing college logos to com
panies that employ sweatshop
labor.

Student organizations
are getting help and encour
agement from labor rights
groups and unions. Global
Exchange, a San Francisco hu
man rights organization, for
example, paid to print 4,000
anti-Gap posters and ship
them to campuses. It also or
ganized the speaking tour for
Abad. "Our campaign has re
ally taken off," said Miriam
Joffe-Block, a 21-yearold
Penn senior who helped to
start Penn Students Against
Sweatshops in the spring. "It's
a very complicated issue —
global economic justice —
but this is a very tangible way
for students to see themselves
connected to the issue."

In other words, money
talks. Gap is one of the largest
and most profitable clothing
companies in the world. Cam
pus chic is its stock in trade.
Gap Inc., which also
runs the Banana Republic and
Old Navy chains, posted a 32
percent gain
in earnings
for the third
quarter,
ended Oct.
30. The San
Francisco
company had
a profit of
$315 million, r*_.tT* "**

or 35 cents a
share, on sales
of $3.05 bil
lion. In the
1998 period,
it had earnings
of $237 mil
lion, or 27
cents a share,
on sales of
$2.4 billion.
Alan
Marks, a Gap
spokesman,
said the com
pany em
ployed 40
monitors —
soon to in
crease to 60 —
who travel
around the
world, inspect
ing the
company's
2,000 suppliers
every three
months to

Labor activists are teaming up with local college
campus groups to take on Gap with posters. ;

make sure they are abiding by
Gap's formal code of conduct.
"What's important is to
understand what we're doing
to address this issue, and we're
doing quite a bit," Marks said.
He said that if a factory
violates the company's code
of conduct, it could lose its
Gap business. He would not
elaborate.
"Sweatshop factories are
problem factories," Marks
said, speaking generally. "It
doesn't make sense to do busi¬

ness with those kinds of fac
tories."
Chie (pronounced Chee)
Abad paints a different pic
ture. In 1993, the now 39
year-old Fihpina moved to
Saipan, the largest of the
Northern Mariana Islands in

the western Pacific. She was
hired at a South Korean
owned garment factory, Sako
Corp. Of the 500 workers,
most were Chinese and Fili
pino women who had paid
upward of $3,000 to middle
men to secure their jobs.
Abad said that Gap and
its sister chains were the main
customers of the factory. She
remembers being shocked that
polar fleece vests made by her
factory were being sold at Ba
nana Republic for $78. Abad

started work as a seamstress
earning $2.15 an hour — the
island's minimum wage at the
time — before getting her
hourly wage increased to
$3.05 an hour.
Even though Saipan is a
U.S. commonwealth, it can set
a lower minimum wage than

the states. It also
does not have to
abide by U.S. im
migration laws.
Garment facto
ries can import
their entire work
forces from Asia,
pay them less

than the U.S.
minimum wage
and still sew
"Made in the
U.S.A." into their
products.
Abad said
the factory where
she worked
flouted U.S. regu
lations that pro
tect the rights of
workers. She said
the factory rou
tinely fired work
ers if they became
pregnant. When
workers com
plained, the fac
tory made a con
cession: It stopped
firing pregnant
workers, but they
had to pay for
their own medical
expenses.

Abad said
when she tried to
form a union, she
was fired and reinstated only
by court order.
"All of us were aiming to
save money and go back
home,'' Abad said. "Especially
for workers from the Philip
pines, we studied American
history. We saw the United
States as the champion on ba
sic rights. I didn't expect to
face such terrible conditions."
Abad said Gap monitors
visited the factory but had
little effect. "I admire the
Gap's code of conduct for

vendors, I really do," she said.
"But workers don't under
stand it."
She said at her former
factory, there was only one
copy posted by the manager's
office and it was printed in
English. Most of the workers
spoke Chinese.
Marks, the Gap spokes
man, said he could not com
ment about conditions at the
Sako factory. "I do not have
specific- knowledge of her
complaint," he said.
In June, the Equal Em
ployment Opportunity Com
mission filed two lawsuits on
behalf of Abad and fired preg
nant workers. In a separate ac
tion, Gap and 17 other com
panies were named in a class
action lawsuit filed in January
on behalf of Saipan workers
who allegedly were denied
overtime pay.

Nine retailers and cloth
ing companies involved in re
lated litigation have agreed to
settle complaints. Gap contin
ues to fight.
Abad said Gap was
singled out for the campus
campaign launched in late Oc
tober because it was the larg
est customer of Saipan facto¬

. The campus movement
against sweatshops began
building three years ago with
backlash again st Nike Inc. At
the time, the footwear com
pany was dogged by charges
that contractors in Vietnam
and Indonesia ran unsafe fac
tories and underpaid workers.
Still the target of labor
and campus activists, Nike
said in November it was of
fering students the chance to
inspect its contract factories
during spring break.
Meanwhile, the pressure
against Gap is heating up. "It's
just another way that compa
nies try to rip us off," said
Emily Pope, a 20-year-old jun
ior at the University of Dela
ware who helped to start the
Student Labor Action Com
mittee. "We shouldn't let this
happen."

From staff reports
Stephan Smith will perform Sat
urday, December 11th at 10 p.m. in the
Junction. Free food and coffee will be
provided. As always, an open mic will
follow the performance.
First touted by Pete Seeger, and
compared to Woody Guthrie by The
New York Times, Smith writes popular
songs that are genre breaking; not only
has he grabbed the ears of his folk con
temporaries, but also those of the hip
hop, R&B, and country audiences who
are singing his songs.
Smith's parents are Monica Smith,
an Austrian, and Mohammed Said, an
Iraqi. He was raised in Richmond, Vir
ginia, in a multicultural environment,
where he grew up surrounded by the

Folk off the presses

music of the Arabic Middle East and Af
rica, of Mozart and Duke Ellington and
of the blues and ballads of American
oral tradition.
Smith is a consummate instrumen
talist. Of his childhood, Smith says,
"We could choose which instrument to
play, but there was no choice whether
to study an instrument." He learned
piano at three years of age, violin at
four, and guitar at 11. He has played
such disparate styles of music as rock,
folk, hip-hop, R&B, jazz, classical, old
time, blues, Irish and gypsy. He played
his first recital at age five, and has
played at fiddler's conventions in the
South throughout his life. He sings
songs in nine languages, three of which
he speaks fluently. (He's currently
working on numbers four and five!)
After studying jazz at Virginia

Common
wealth Uni
versity for a
short pe
r l o d ,
Stephan
(then aged
18) picked
up an elec
tric guitar
and toured
with punk
rock band,
Always Au
gust. From
there he
landed in
Europe
where he
worked as
an avant
garde jazz
musician
and migrant
laborer, all
the while
soaking up
the music he
heard on
the streetcorners and in the
fields. Upon
returning to

the United States, he trav
eled the country learning firsthand the
songs of the American folk tradition.
While passing through Colorado,
he befriended Beat Generation icon
Allen Ginsberg and later toured with
him to promote the poet's Holy Soul,
Jelly Roll recording.
Moving to New York City in the
early '90s, Stephan made his living fix
ing automobiles and motorcycles and
playing small bars along the East Coast.
The 1997, he learned of the alleged
police brutality of Haitian emigre Abner
Louima, and with the help of friend and
veteran rocker Patti Smith he composed
a song about the incident, titled "The
Ballad of Abner Louima." Immediately
the song was picked up by Pacifica Ra
dio Network and played nationally, gar
nering Stephan articles in The New Yoik
Times and invitations to participate and
perform at support rallies for Mr.
Louima. Smith said, "It's always been
my dream to write songs that would just
spread by themselves." This dream

came true with "The Ballad of Abner
Louima."
His first commercial recording,
Now's the Time, was released on
Rounder Recoders in June, 1999.
Now's the Time contains 13 original
songs and one song in the public do
main ("Railroad Boy"). All of the songs
were recorded live to two track with
Stephan on vocals, accompanied by his
acoustic guitar, banjo and harmonica.
The other songs on this album re
flect Stephan's wide ranging personal
experience, from being a migrant
worker in France, an avant-garde jazz
violinist in Europe, to a punk rocker in
Richmond.
Whether he is singing a plea for
human unity, as in the title song, de
scribing the tragic events of a schoolyard
shooting in "West Kentucky," or pour
ing out his heart in the a cappella love
song "Hopelessly and Endlessly in
Love," Stephan is nothing less than the
honest product of his experience and
conscience.

As for the female perspec
tive, they feel that men misun
derstand priorities, relation
ships, superiority and women in

"never listen to them."

was which sex overreacts to

findings were over

for this is be

It was also
commented that women

"read too much into things,
and take even the smallest
most insignificant things to
heart." People also stated that
females "read too much into
things and at times lack a sense
of humor." It was also stated
that women "hold grudges, cry

explode, complain, and jump

Dear Libby,
I would suggest that the
library looks into purchasing
the Social Science Citation In
dex in the form of CD ROM
or so we have access via the
Internet. Looking through
years and years is extraordinar
ily time consuming.
Troy
Dear Troy,
I'm with you. Libby just
wants to run the other way
when someone asks for help in
using this source, with its mi
croscopic print and multiple
volumes every year. So she
asked the Head of Reference,

Janelle Wertzberger, why we
don't get this source online.
Here's her reply.
Yes, it IS cumbersome to
use in print format. For exactly
that reason, the librarians
tested the web version earlier
this fall since we thought that
online access would provide
better access for library users.
Unfortunately, we found
the online version to have some
serious limitations. The web
version covers less than a third
of the journal titles covered in
the print SSCI. The web only
covers articles written in the
past 10 years, and drops a year
off the end each vear.

- continued from page 8 -
Each version costs about
$7000/year so we can't buy
both. Faculty from all social
science departments are being
consulted and we will share
this comment with the collec
tion development committee.

Hearts to the largely in
visible but critically important
technical services staff of the
library who have gone out of
their way to get materials pro
cessed fast and out for you to
use this semester. Extra hearts
to the cataloging staff who
have rush cataloged books for
those of you threatening a
meltdown on the spot.

LIBBY

Hearts to Kim Wolf in
the bookstore for her informa
tive warning about how to pre
vent theft of your expensive
textbooks, which many of you
leave unattended on tables in
the library. If you must walk
off from your books (at least
the ones with good resale
value), at least follow Kim's
good advice and pick a page in
every textbook and mark it
with something that you and
only you can clearly identify.

If your textbook or backpack
is stolen report it to Campus Se
curity and the Bookstore imme
diately. The bookstore has al
ready caught a few hoodlums
trying to sell your books to the
Buy-back folks.
Darts to the wasteful
sloths who print at random and
don't even bother to go pick up
the copy from the printer. Do
you own a forest or something?
Have you ever heard of conser
vation? How about only print
ing when you really need the
article, not just when some ran
dom urge passes through your
limited brain? You can't possi
bly read all this stuff in the
amount of time left in the se
mester, anyway, so don't print
what you won't use. In Novem
ber the waste at the one printer
on the main floor of the library
alone, was a staggering 54
pounds, or well over 6,000
sheets. Come look at the stack.
We saved it for a reminder.

Libby will return in 2000
to answer your burning ques
tions and respond to your
thoughtful suggestions about
improving library service. You
can send your suggestions to
lmussel or drop a note in the
suggestion box on the front

You might think that ev
erything there is to say about
Barbie has been said. But then
Mattel comes out with a new
doll--and the tsk-ing begins
anew. The newest addition to
the Barbie family is "Working
Woman Barbie," and represents
a collaboration between Mattel
and Working Woman maga
zine. The doll is a statuesque
blonde with hip-length hair.
She's wearing a silver-gray suit
and toting a collection of work
ing-girl gear: cell phone, travel
mug, shoulder bag, portable
computer and copy of Working
Woman.

Working Woman Barbie?

Even with the magazine's
participation, she remains
Barbie—which is to say that she
embodies an ideal exceeding
what normal women could
achieve. Her suit appears to be

tight beyond the point of com
fort. The Velcro-fastened pen
cil skirt is reversible so that it
becomes a glittery skirt.
There are things about
the doll that are a bit superfi
cial, acknowledges Working
Woman spokeswoman Chris
tina Duffney, but the magazine
still thinks the venture is a good
idea. "Although a lot of people
don't always agree, Barbie is
somewhat of a role model for
young girls, in the fact that a
lot of girls play with Barbie,"
she says. "Having a Working

Woman Barbie is something
positive associated with an ac
tual magazine _ not a "Dr.
Barbie' but something that's
real that they can associate it
with." "It is a serious approach
to Barbie but it's also for little
girls and they want to make it
fun for them," she says. "We
went into it hoping to inspire
girls, to let them know they can
break the glass ceiling, can be
anything they want to be. But
there is still the whole fantasy
part of Barbie. You can't make
it too serious for young girls."

len. Very Upset
Dear PJ and VU,
Try wearing your watch
and sticking your gloves in the
pocket of your coat. Libby
doesn't want to sound unsym
pathetic but you are big boys
and girls. How exactly do you
think a camera is going to stop
someone from taking your be
longings when you practically
invite theft by leaving valuables
unattended?
Libby cruised the library
the other day, as she often does
just to get a flavor of the place,
and was astonished at the num
ber of unattended purses,
glasses, expensive textbooks,
wallets and laptop computers.
Ducking into the restroom is
one thing, but taking off for din
ner or sports practice and leav
ing your valuables out in the

open is just plain dumb. It
takes about two seconds to put
your wallet back in your
pocket or gather up your
purse. It pains Libby that thefts
have occurred, but the best
way to prevent the loss of your
heirloom jewelry or hard
earned cash is to keep it on
your person or leave it in your

room.
Dear Libby,
I was trying to be help
ful and put back the books I
was done with and one of the
librarians swooped down on
me and said not to reshelve my
books.
(Unsigned)
Dear Helpful,
Thanks but we'll do it. It
is nice of you to offer but just
leave anything you are done
with on the shelves on the wall
at the front of each floor. They
are marked with bright green
signs. Libby doesn't want to
seem ungrateful but you'd be
surprised at how many people
confuse an E with an F, a P
with an R, and think BF comes
after BP.
Don't even get me
staited on the numerals. We
find 200 shelved in front of

20; 400 befoie 4. And
decimals? Like did this whole
campus just zone out during
fifth grade math oi what? You
tell me Helpful. Which comes
first? 41.6,41.55 or 41.351?
You may think that shelving
books is an easy job, but our
shelving crew can't afford to
be mathematically challenged.
We appreciate the offer but
we'll take care of it.
Dear Libby,
I was in the women's
bathroom on the second floor
when the electricity went out.
Are you aware that there are
no lights in the bathroom?

Letters to the Editor

Unresearched poster
perturbs student
As I walked out of my biology lab
in McCreary Hail on Monday
night I noticed a sign on a
professor's door that infuriated me. The
sign read, "What Do These Men and
Women Have in Common?" and had a
list of names below it. Beneath the
names, the sign read, "They are all not
Greek. Keep your individuality." I
looked at the sign, thought about it, and
then became angered. I am not normally
a person who gets upset easily, nor do I
complain about things often, but this
sign angered me greatly, and for several
reasons.
The main thing that upset me
about this sign was its implication that
by joining a fraternity or sorority, a per
son is forced to give up his or her indi
viduality. This implication could not any
be further from the truth. If anything,
fraternities and sororities foster indi

Ballentyne's "publicity
stunt" should not be
tolerated
I am not going to lower myself to
Mr. Ballentyne's level by respond
ing to his specific charges towards
"radical feminists" (a redundant label
since the concept of feminism is itself
radical). Most people reading his De
cember 2 editorial have the common
sense to shake their heads in amazement
at the hypocrisy of his statements. Some
will have the courage to rebut his delu
sions in writing. I would wager that
Mr. Ballentyne's own defense would be
that he was writing simply to generate
controversy, to increase circulation, to
have people write letters to the editor.

Gettysburg College is an impor

inability to develop the social compo

On Saturday night I went to see

UNTARY. However, liberals
attack it as forced prayer, which
it is not. The only problem they
have is that praying would be
done, that something other
than the approved doctrine
would be said in the schools.
That being said, when it
suits their purpose, liberals will
put nonChnstian religions in
schools. Let me provide you an
example: over the summer,
courts ruled that one school's
Earth Day programs violated
the First Amendment. How?
Well, there were distortions of
Hindu Gods; school adminis
trators told the children that
before plucking a flower they
should ask permission of the
earth goddess Gaia, among
other things. I don't know
about you, but this sounds like
religion to me, and the only
reason it was put into the
school was that they were us
ing it to teach an aspect of the
American liberal ideology.

i'xpummj American liberalism:
Religious intolerance and the war on
Christianity

harm anyone else.
Liberals in this country
have, over the last thirty years,
been on a campaign against re
ligion, especially Christianity.
They force atheism in our
schools. They have outlawed
public displays of religious
icons. They show utter con
tempt in discussion for anyone
who bases their positions on
the issues on core religious be
liefs. This week's column in the
series on American liberalism
will explore these topics.

School prayer has been a
hot issue over the last couple
decades. Liberals have stated
many times that prayer in
schools is the establishment of
religion, and that a moment of
silence is school prayer. This is
patently false. A moment of si
lence is a moment of silence.
In a moment of silence, you are
silent. You can pray to yourself
if you want, you can think
about whatever you want. The
only thing you are required to
do is be quiet. If you want to
pray it's your choice, it is VOL-

cies. Keep in mind that China
is the World Bank's number
one customer as they have been
able to pay back their loans. If
you believe that relocating
people is the answer to decreas

China claims it is, then please

A town in New Jersey
had a display on the lawn of its
town hall during the Christmas
season last year, it included a
nativity scene, a menorah (so
it's not just Christianity), and
such secular images as Santa
Claus and Frosty the Snowman.
This display fit within the cur
rent Supreme Court guidelines
for displays of such type on
public property. However, the
liberal bastion known as the
ACLU did not like it.
They went door to door
in the town until they found
ONE person they could talk
into letting them file a suit for.
Their problem: the nativity and
the menorah. The ACLU said
ter way to solve the problems
of this world then please let
your voice be heard. The
people of Tibet do not deserve
to be playing pieces in our in
ternational game of Monopoly.
No one does.

Thank you to the Stu
dents for Free Tibet organiza
tion for their valuable informa
tion and literature.

that those items should be pro
hibited from being on public
ground. This not being so, val
iant defender of the First
Amendment, the ACLU,
stamped on the amendment
again. As with school prayer,
the provisions they seek violate
not only the free exercise of
religion clause, but also the free
speech clause. But that is ok to
them > it's not speech they like.
Finally, let's look at how
the liberals treat the "Religious
Right." They accuse them of
wanting to establish a national
religion, namely Christianity,
through voluntary prayer,
while at the same time telling
kids not to read the bible while
in school, thereby more or less
establishing atheism.

Liberals accuse the Reli
gious Right of "forcing their
values down society's throat,"
although, again, there are no
plans to do that, no legislation
at all, while liberals force
condoms in schools and teach
non-abstinence sex education
whether the parents like it or
not. They accuse the Religious
Right of being intolerant, who
is it that is saying all these
things about Christians? The
Liberals are.
The Liberals again show
their true colors through their
actions, not their words. They
have a problem with religion,
and they have a problem with
the First Amendment, as it ap
plies to speech and beliefs that
they do not agree with. They
accuse religious people of be
ing extreme, but who is it that's
going out to nullify the other
religion?

"In our struggle for free
dom, truth is the only weapon
we possess." - His Holiness the
Dalai Lama.
What are the images that
come to mind when you think
of Tibet? The Dalai Lama sit
ting cross-legged, his youthful
face appearing calm and peace
ful? Brave, adventurous moun
taineers attempting to peak
some of the highest mountains
in the world? Maybe even Brad

Pitt in the film Seven Years in
Tibet. Some of these images do
portray an aspect of reality, but
if you want the facts, read on.
There is a lot more to Tibet
then Hollywood captures on
film. Much of this hidden re
ality, which is not always peace
ful, is being caused by countries
such as the United States. Our
tax dollars might very soon be
ruining thousands of lives.
Educate yourself. We must let
our voires be heard.

There is a very powerful
institution that exists as an in
ternational financial organiza
tion. It is called the World
Bank. Its mission is to provide
loans and credits to developing
countries for projects that alle
viate poverty and promote eco
nomic development.
Although the intentions
might very well be true, in re
ality, the World Bank is a busi
ness whose main objective is
profit. There are 181 member
countries in the World Bank,
and the countries that represent
the Board of Executive Direc
tors are chosen in proportion
to their capitol contributions.
The major shareholders are the
seven most industrialized coun
tries of the world.

In short, the World Bank
funds and implements infra
structure and agricultural
projects in countries that do not
meet our standards of modern
ization. In most cases, ad
equate research is not per
formed and they attempt to
implement modern technolo¬

gies and practices in a culture
that is not ready for industrial
ization. Because of this lack of
in-depth study and anthropo
logical research, the World
Bank actions upset the entire
community that they are, in
theory, trying to help.
That is not all. Once a
project is implemented, the
countries face a huge debt, and
since they usually have limited
funds, they cannot pay it.
Over time, interest works
in favor of the World Bank and
they end up the winners even
tually being rewarded with
profit and the satisfaction of
knowing they have only wors
ened the lives of innocent
people worldwide. (For spe
cific details on failed projects,
please read Aiding Violence by
Peter Uvin (1998), and Devel
opment and Bureaucratic Power
in Lesotho (1997)).

Free Tibet

The World Bank's latest
project involves Tibet and
China. These two countries
have a long history of contro
versy over land boundaries. In
1949 Tibet was invaded by the
Chinese Communist forces. As
the majority of Tibetans are
Buddhist, many have avoided
the violence of the Chinese and
have been forced to flee their
country.
Since 1949, over 1.2 mil
lion Tibetans have died due to
the Chinese occupation. More
than 6,000 monasteries have
been destroyed and thousands
of Tibetans have been impris¬

oned and tortured for their re
ligious or political beliefs. The
Tibetans have become a minor
ity in their own country.
On June 24, 1999, the
World Bank Board of Directors
approved funding to support
China's $160 million Western
Poverty Reduction Project.
This project involves transfer
ring 57,775 Chinese farmers to
historic areas in Tibet. China's
agenda is to alleviate poverty
and to promote their coloniza
tion policy. The project will
occur the expense of ethnic
minorities in addition to being

When a Canadian writer
asked a male friend why men
feel threatened by women, he
said that "they are afraid
women will laugh at them."
However, when she asked
women why they feel threat
ened by men, she got a very
different response: "We're
afraid of being killed."
Women face a great
amount of violence, usually
committed by men, on a daily
basis. These crimes range from
domestic abuse to rape to even
murder. Although violence is
so regular in women's lives,
some have tried to downplay
violence against women and
have claimed that men also face
such violence. However,
women face a great variety of
violent acts simply because they
are female.

Worldwide violence against
women is not a myth

This past Monday
marked the ten-year anniver
sary of a horrific attack on
women at the University of
Montreal. On December 6,
1989, a 25-year-old male, Marc
Lpine, entered a classroom in
the school of engineering. He
immediately separated the men
from the women, threw the
men out of the room, and,
while screaming "You're all f—
ing feminists!," opened fire on
the women.
In only a half-hour, he
killed 14 women, injured nine
other women and four men,
and then shot himself. His
three-page suicide note showed
his contempt for women,
whom he blamed for his fail
ures. Lpine had been denied
admission into the school of
engineering and felt humiliated
by women he saw as being
feminists because they were in
vading "male territory."
This past May marked

the eleventh anniversary of a
brutal attack on Claudia
Brenner and her lover,
Rebecca, on the Appalachian
Trail right here in Adams
County. A man stalked them,
shot them in the middle of the
night, and left them for dead -
simply because they were les
bians. While Brenner survived
the attack, Rebecca did not.
And yet, the shooting was not
the end of this terrible ordeal.
At the trial of Stephen Roy
Carr, the man who shot them,
Carr's lawyer actually had the
nerve to imply that Brenner
and her lover had provoked the
attack by "teasing" Carr with
their sexuality. The lawyer was
therefore saying that the two
women were responsible for
the attack. Fortunately, the
judge did not agree and Carr
was sentenced to life in prison
without parole.

Women are also victims
of violence committed by men
they know and live with. In a
random survey of 930 San
Francisco women, the follow
ing was found: 44 percent were
victims of rape or attempted
rape; 3 8 percent had been
sexually abused as children; 16
percent were victims of incest;
14 percent had been raped by
their own husbands; and 21
percent had experienced vio
lence at the hands of their hus
bands.
Between the years of
1976 and 1987, husbands were
responsible for 33 percent of
all murdered women in the
United States. Between one
third and one-half of American
battered women are also vic
tims of marital sexual assault.
And according the U.S. Depart
ment of Justice, a woman is se
riously injured by her husband
or partner every fifteen sec
onds. Globally, women face
great and disturbing forms of

violence. Women in Pakistan
and Jordan are victims of
"honor killings," where
women's male relatives kill
them for a number of different
reasons, including divorcing an
abusive husband and "losing"
their virginity to a rapist.
AH over the world, nearly
130 million women and girls,
with an increase of two million
each year, undergo female geni
tal mutilation, a practice that
is just as terrible as it sounds as
it is usually done without an
esthesia and with razor blades,
knives, or even scissors. In a
number of countries including
Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and
Turkey, if a woman rejects the
sexual advances of a man, she
runs the risk of having sulfuric
acid thrown in her face by the
man as revenge.

I do not believe that all
men should be held responsible
for the actions of individuals.
I also am not arguing that
women never commit violent
acts, but men are much more
violent than women.
The annual National
Crime Victimization Survey,
collected by the Department of
Justice, found that women
commit 2.1 million violent acts
per year. Men, however, com
mit 13 million violent acts ev
ery year. The survey also found
that in the United States there
is one violent male offender for
every nine men and boys (10
years old and over), while there
is one violent female offender
for every 56 women and girls
(10 and over).

I feel that it is very im
portant to discuss the great
amount of male violence
women all over the world face
daily. When people try to claim
that such violence is imaginary
and not as widespread as it re
ally is, this is not only disgust
ing, but also dangerous. Only
when people are aware of the
violence can it be stopped.

Terribly disillusioned, I
now feel compelled to speak
publicly concerning the
Administration's failure to
stimulate Greek Life, most re
cently evidenced by its direc
tive to initiate Sophomore
Rush. The social component
of the Gettysburg Experience
is being shattered.
Administrative actions or
the lack thereof have reduced
Greek Life to an outdated,
negatively perceived element of

campus life. It is not in the best
interests of Gettysburg to per
mit the Greek system to suffer
a slow and painful death. This
correspondence is not intended
to continue the now infamous
debate regarding the pros and
cons of Greek organizations.
Rather, it is my desire that the
senior leadership of the College
communicate directly with stu
dent and alumni leaders, most
notably the greek Alumni
Council and the Board of Fel
lows. While preserving a
proud College, Gettysburg
should use the Greek system as
a formidable cornerstone of a

past, present and future, de
serve a vibrant, diverse social
life which includes the leader
ship and philanthropic oppor
tunities provided by Greek
Life. The administration has
not sought student or alumni
input to develop any other vi
able energizing social opportu
nities. The administration will
argue that a few students serve
on the Board of Trustees' com
mittees and that the alumni
who served on the Commission
on the Future, are examples of
undergraduate and alumni in
volvement. However, speaking
from personal experience, as a
student representative to the
Board of Trustees, as well as a
member of the Commission of
the Future, these forms provide
an extremely limited opportu
nity for student and alumni
representation.

I would ask the Board of
Trustees to participate in an on
campus, Town Hall Meeting
followed by break-out sessions
and concluding with a follow
up survey. The purpose of these
initiatives is to begin a grass
roots discussion among stu
dents, alumni, and trustees re
garding the elements which will
comprise the social component
of the Gettysburg Experience
of the twenty-first century.
The aforementioned
channels would provide signifi
cant, practical opportunities
for widespread direct input by
students and alumni alike. Rec
ognizing the valuable re
sources, formidable talents and
vested interests of both current
students and alumni, I would
recommend that the Student
Senate and Alumni Board of

What is a feminist?
They are CEOs,
students, house
keepers, teachers, and house
wives. They are mothers, sis
ters, wives, granddaughters,
friends, colleagues, grandmoth
ers, and cousins. They are
straight, gay, and bisexual.
They are married, single, and
divorced. They are pro-life and
pro-choice. They are women
and men. In other words, it is
not as easy to pick out a femi
nist as Mr. Dan Ballentyne
seems to think it is.
In his December 2 col
umn, "Exposing American Lib
eralism: Radical Feminism,"

Letters to the Editor, continued
Ballentyne's radical feminism rebuked

Mr. Ballentyne proceeds to ex
plain that "a very large num
ber of" feminists are radical.
He is wrong. Many of the pro
fessors that I have talked with
this week are very concerned
with Mr. Ballentyne's defini
tion of a radical feminist. They
have tried to rectify his mistake
by giving the correct definition
for radical feminism. Radical
feminists believe that patriar
chy is the central system of the
oppression of women. They
are concerned with sexuality
and want to have control over
their own bodies. And one of
their main planks of their plat
form is violence against

women.
If Mr. Ballentyne wants
to pick apart a form of femi
nism, why doesn't he use the
most common and publicized
form of feminism found in the
United States: liberal feminism?
Yes, there is a difference be
tween radical and liberal femi
nism, Mr. Ballentyne. If you
had done your research, you
would have known that. In
stead, you tried to mix the two
forms together.
Liberal feminists are
more concerned with gender
justice and equal opportunities
in all aspects of women's lives.
Liberal feminists would not be

fighting if they did not believe
that women are still not equal.
Our fight is far from over. By
using this statement, I am not
defining myself as a radical.
I'm not for using violence to
reach a goal of equal rights and
opportunities for all. I'm say
ing that, as a woman, I have to
struggle each and every day
against close-minded people
who claim they know what the
definition of a feminist is, but
actually don't. There is no
"real" way to define a feminist,

as I explained in my opening
paragraph. But there is no
room for stereotypes in the
description of a feminist either.
As for Mr. Ballentyne's
treatment of the concerns of a
feminist, I am appalled. They
are the typical responses of a
person who is not familiar with
feminism. First, I will address
sexual harassment. Here is the
definition Gettysburg College
provides its students in the
Handbook and in a pamphlet
for women and men who feel
that they have been harassed.

"Sexual harassment is unwel
come behavior of a sexual or
gender-based nature." This
pertains to men and women.
An unwelcome compliment
should not be tolerated by ei
ther of the sexes. As a femi
nist, I encourage men who have
been sexually harassed to step
forward and press charges. I'm
not saying this as a joke. I am
dead serious. No one should
ever be belittled in a degrading
fashion by any member of the
opposite sex.
A favorite subject of this
college is abortion. Being a
feminist does not mean that
you are pro-choice. Most con
servative feminists and some
liberal feminists are pro-life.
Being pro-choice means just
that: you believe in having the
right to choose whether you
want to have an abortion or
not. Being pro-choice does not

mean that you promote the use
of abortion. I consider myself
to be pro-choice, and as a
woman, I personally would
probably make the choice not
to have an abortion.
My reason behind being
pro-choice and keeping abor
tion legal is the fact that safe
abortions are available to all
who choose to have one. Be
fore Roe v. Wade, abortions
existed. They were unsafe, il
legal, and left many women
emotionally and physically
scarred. If Roe v. Wade is ever
reversed, abortions will not
cease to exist. They will just
revert to the status they held
prior to 1973. Having an abor
tion is not like going to Wal
Mart to buy a new CD. It is a
choice which has to be well
contemplated. Pro-choice
means keeping the choice to
have an abortion, not being ir
responsible and using abortion
as a form nf hirth control.

As for the point that a
majority of feminists do not
want equality between the
sexes, but instead want to be
superior to men, that is totally
untrue. How could we, as
feminists, ever aim to be supe
rior to men when we are still
not equal to men? Feminists
are still striving to break gen
der barriers built by men. The
glass ceiling exists now as it did
years ago. Sure, women have
gotten further in the corporate
world, but they are still being
held back by the glass ceiling
that men put in place. Mr.
Ballentyne, please do not insult
feminists by claiming that they
are trying to obtain a new goal,
while their first one of equal
rights and opportunity still has
not been reached.

Domestic abuse is an is
sue for both genders. Yes, it is
possible for men to be the vic
tims of physical abuse and rape.
But, statistics will tell you that
an overwhelming majority of

the victims are female. Accord
ing to the National Crime Vic
timization Survey published tn
1993, 93% of spousal abuse
victims, 91% of boyfriend
abuse victims, and 89% of ex
spousal abuse victims were fe
male. According to the FBI,
that same year women ac
counted for 70% of all murders
committed by a person v/ith
whom they were involved inti
mately. Yes, the remaining per
centage of victims are men. It
is a shame that both men and
women have to live in fear of
possible abuse by a loved one.

But women - feminists, as Mr.
Ballentyne is so fond of label
ing them - are the bad ones be
cause we are interested in pro
tecting our sisters against do
mestic abuse by telling them
about the kinds of signs to look
for in their boyfriends and hus
bands. If you are so concerned
about this issue, Mr.
Ballentyne, why don't you help
sponsor a Male Domestic Vio
lence Awareness Week? If you
are willing, you have your first
volunteer to help you right
here. I believe that no one,
male or female, should have to
live with domestic violence.

Mr. Ballentyne brings up
the idea of men having to pay
a rape tax to help compensate
rape victims. Well, what kind
of tax are women paying?
None that has an actual label.
Then how does the United
States explain the reason why
a woman makes about 75 cents
to every dollar that a man
makes, even if they are doing
equal work? There is no real
reason behind this. To some,
it just seems fair. To others, it
seems like a punishment for
being a woman in the
workforce. And Mr.
Ballentyne is right, America
was founded on equal rights
and justice for all. So, I pose
the question, does that seem
like equal justice to you?

The fact is that all people
are created equal, whether they
are in America or on the other
side of the globe. Women do
have a better deal here in
America. We do not get acid
poured on us for rejecting a
man's advances like in
Bangladesh and we do not get
killed for seeking a divorce
from our husbands like in the
Middle East. That is why we
must obtain equal rights here
and help other women across
the world obtain the basic hu
man rights for themselves.
Another thing that Mr.
Ballentyne is right about - he is
not a sexist. He is just misin
formed. I think that it was
wrong for him to talk about the
agendas of a "very large num
ber" of feminists across the
country and around the globe.
Instead, I suggest that he take
the time to educate himself on

a large number of these topics.
A few classes that I suggest that
he take are Women's Studies
120: Intro to Women's Studies,
Political Science 280: Modern
Political Ideologies (which ad
dresses both conservative and
liberal feminism), and, if he
feels up to the challenge,
Women's Studies 300: Feminist
Theories. Then, Mr.
Ballentyne, you can speak
about what ever form of femi
nism you want, in an educated
and informed way. Until then,
please do not give feminists a
bad name. It is people like you
who make women scared to
admit they are feminists be
cause they will be labeled as a
man-hater or (one of my favor
ite labels) a Femi-Nazi. Mr.
Ballentyne, you are right, you
are not a sexist. Instead, I be
lieve that you are a conserva
tive feminist.

work better with people, and
it has also taught me the im
portance of friendship. It has
also helped to teach me the
importance of hard work, re
sponsibility, and dedication to
an organization of which I am
part. Although many of my best
friends are in my fraternity, I
am not compelled to do every
thing they do, nor do I share
all the beliefs that they hold.
My brothers recognize that I

am my own person, and they
respect me and my wishes.
Never once have I been
forced to compromise my own
personal beliefs in order to
please others in my fraternity.
I do not think that my broth
ers would ever ask me to do
that, nor would I ask that of
them. Anybody who has ever
been in a fraternity or a soror
ity knows that by joining one
they are not giving up their in
dividuality, rather they are giv

to better themselves as an indi¬

would realize this fact.
In addition, in my two
and a half years at Gettysburg
College, I have never once seen
a poster or sign anywhere on
campus that specifically attacks
an organization, or one that
encourages students not to join
a particular organization.
Never once have I seen a sign
that read, "Don't Join Student
Senate," or "Retain Your Indi
viduality: Don't Join the
Band."

I realize that this sign
might have been a knock on the
ads that have been running in
The Gettysburgian lately pro
moting Greek Life, but those
ads do not attack any other
group on campus. The ads in
The Gettysburgian do not say
that by not joining a fraternity
or sorority you are doing some
thing wrong, but the sign
posted in McCreary does just
that. Maybe it is just me, but I
find there to be something
wrong with that.

I do understand that the
Constitution of the United
States does allow for freedom
of speech, and therefore you
are allowed to express your
opinion, but do it in a construc
tive way. Don't bash something
you know nothing about. If
whoever posted that sign did
some research or even spoke to
someone in a fraternity or so
rority, they would see how
wrong what they wrote was.

me most of all about his edito

up a paper and even write to
the 'Burgian in response, why
did he choose the subject of
"radical feminists"? Why not
Jews? Or Asians? Or Afncan
Amencans? After all, one can
argue that Jewish people are
proportionately wealthier than
most of society. Why can't they
share their money? Those of
Asian descent are generally
smarter. They are always tak
ing up spots in our best colleges

Americans receive more gov

Publicity Stunt

The one simple reason
Mr. Ballentyne chose to write
about "radical feminists" is be
cause you can't get expelled
from Gettysburg College by
bashing women in print. Say
something negative and com
pletely inaccurate about some
other minority group and you
are instantly booted off cam
pus. But Mr. Bailentyne can get
away with accusing women

Gettysburg College Commu
nity, whether they concur or
disagree. However, in this
modern age of spin-doctors
and professional marketing re
sponses to any criticism, I
would prefer to discuss these
issues directly, as opposed to
with electronic or written com
munications.
Let us all share our
thoughts openly, build on
gettysburg's trademark sense of
a friendly, socially active and
responsible community, and
thereby enable our alma mater
to remain true to its charter of
being a "Salutary Influence."

with committing murder when
they have abortions (because
we all know men have nothing
to do with producing a baby).
He can charge them with do
mestic violence, because so
many men have been abused by
their spouses, been battered,
beaten, assaulted, and forced to
support their children while
their wives leave them. He can
try to get away with it, at least,
as long as he claims that this
was simply a publicity stunt.
Ballentyne's use of the
term "radical feminists" to ad
dress a small number of ex
tremists is a thinly veiled cover.

He reveals himself when he
states that these facts (and I use
the _terirf "facts" loosely, much
like Mr. Ballentyne did) apply
to most feminists. Of course,
we, as educated college stu
dents know better than Mr.
Ballentyne. We know that Get
tysburg College has made it
quite clear to people willing to
espouse inflammatory lies that
they will not be tolerated. The
College should adhere to its
policies, both written and im
plied, that are designed to en
sure students remain free of
such blatant harassment.

the orchestra reduced the
choirs to background music
and dominated the major piece,
Hodie. I know that I am not
alone, as many other friends
and relatives voiced similarity
complaints and questioned why
we needed to bring in these
guests. If I want to see them
perform I can go to DC or NYC
anytime. I had gone to see a

my friends display their talent.

In every other show that
I have been to, College students
have performed the majority of
the solos and have sung won
derfully. Not only were the
choir members not allowed to
perform the solos, they were
not even allowed to audition
for the parts and were simply
told "those parts are too diffi
cult, we have hired professional
soloists." With the great level
of talent in the choirs I believe
that some of the members
could have performed the parts
quite well.

If that is not the case and
the parts were too difficult,
why choose that piece of mu
sic? Why not choose music that
the choirs can excel at and use
to show off their strengths and
abilities, including those of in
dividual students in solos?
These students, especially the
seniors who have dedicated
four years to the program, de
serve their chance to shine.
Their friends and especially
their families, who have sacri
ficed so much to give them this
opportunity, simply want and
deserve to see them shine.
It seems as if the music
department has become much
too concerned about showing
off how well it can direct won
derfully elaborate pieces and
has lost touch with its purpose
of teaching and providing op
portunities for students.

This document is the basis for the idea of human rights. It is intended as a list of funda

Bullets top Washington in conference opener

by Erik Bullwinkel
Staff Writer
After two disappointing
losses to local opponents York
and Messiah, the Men's basket
balJ refined for a win in their
first Centennial Conference
game of the 99-00 season.
The Bullets defeated the
Shoremen 67-61 on the road.
The Bullet frontcourt of
Greg Schreiber, Bill Davidson
and Rich Pfiel was once again
dominant. Schreiber led Bul
let scorers with 19 points and
eight boards. Davdison and
Pfiel added with 13 and 10
points, respectively.
Though Washington
opened with strong play and a
14-4 lead, the Bullets took the
lead with a 15-0 run, during
which Shreiber chipped in
seven points. After a Pfiel three
pointer pushed the lead to 29
28, the Bullets never trailed
again. The Bullets fended off the
pesky Shoremen, who at one

point closed the deficit to one,
throughout the second half.
Captain Bill Davidson
commented on the team's play
saying, "On Saturday we had a
great team effort. We got a
contribution from everyone
who played. Greg and Curtis
(McNeil) were outstanding off
the bench.
"Our goal is to win the
Centennial Conference. To be
successful game in and game
out, we need to play every
game like it's a playoff game."
On that note, the Bullets
returned home to play confer
ence rival, no. 15 ranked Johns
Hopkins last night. The Bul
lets came out strong and battled
hard throughout, but they
came up short, falling to the
Blue Jays 65-61.

The Bullets trailed 31-28
at the half, despite holding
Hopkins to under 40% from
the field. The Bullets took their
final lead at 53-51 on a reverse
layup by sophomore guard Jim
Natale.

with a 6-0 run to push their
lead to 57-52. But the Bul
lets answered back, with a
rare five-point play. Davidson
nailed a three pointer and
McNeil was fouled on the
screen, before converting two
free throws to even the game
ar 57 apiece.
Trailing by four with 48
seconds remaining, Schreiber
made two free throws to pull
within two. The Bullets
stopped Hopkins on their
next possession, but were un
able to convert at the other
end to send the game into
overtime.
The Bullets record now
stands at 3-3, 1-1 in the CC.
Their next game is a non-con
ference matchup versus
Ehzabethtown, Saturday.

Junior Greg Schreiber was
named to the CC Weekly
Honor Roll this week.

and pulled down eight

This weekend the Gettysburg
swim teams attended the annual
Franklin & Marshall invitational swim
meet in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The
women's team had an impressive third
place finish overall in the invitational,
advancing from their fourth place
finish last year. The men also did well
with a fourth place finish in the meet.
Helping lead the women's team
to their third place finish were senior
captain Karin Olmsted and junior Missy
West who both had first place finishes
in the 50 freestyle and the 200
breastroke, respectivly.

In addition, first-year Brieanne
Pullis and West also made the "B" quali
fying time for NCAA's, which will take
place in March of 2000.
The first-year women also held
their own in the meet with Pullis lead
ing the pack. Pullis bettered her time
in the 1650 freestyle by over a minute
from that which she swam at the Wash
ington &C Lee meet earlier in the sea
son. The men also established them
selves in the conference with their
fourth place overall finish.
Kris "Noodle" Nessler said of the
weekend "We came out well. The
younger guys had some nice swims early
in the meet which set the tone for the
rest of the weekend."

First-years Brendan Jones and

Sean O' Connor were the first ones to
set the tone for the weekend with their
swims in the 400IM and 1650 freestyle,
respectively.
First-year Liz Janelle said of his
swim "his long lean body cuts through
the water like a knife. His stroke was
effortless and managed to get him a life
time best in the event."
Jon Hegna and David Lavigne also
had respectable swims in the 200
freestyle (5th place) and the 50 freestyle
(3rd place), respectively.
Both the men's and women's team
will have over month off from compe
tition during which they will be train
ing in Gettysburg over the winter break
and then off to Barbados where the real
work will begin.
