Voice mail takes off running
m

By Kristine Meier
Staff Writer

Ring! As of 7:00 a.m. this Satur
day, October 30, all faculty, staff, ad
ministration and students will have the
convince of voice mail.

"I've wanted this system for
eight years now. I think it's
great," said Don Kingston, Di
rector of Telecommunications.
The idea of voice mail has
been in the minds of Kingston
and Mike Martys from Informa
tion Resources for many years,
but because of funding, couldn't
be implemented until now. It
was decided that "the time was
right before we had any major
problems with Y2K and other
wise," said Kingston.
The current telephone
switch, which is over 14 years
old, is only 95% Y2K compliant.
Along with this issue, the manu
facturers of this switch have be
gun to phase out its maintenance
support.
The process of installing
the new phone switch is sup
posed to be a 12-week process.
The college has compressed it
into three.

"We have 5 technical mem
bers, our staff, and many others
working behind the scenes to get
this installed," said Kingston.
The actual switch, Option
81C, from Northern Telecom,
has many features that will ben
efit the college community. Over
512 phones were installed with
the new system in all academic
and administrative buildings.
Training sessions have also been
held each day for the past week,
finishing on October 28.
"It's going to be an excel
lent system for the campus once
it's installed and everyone learns

it," said Pat Rollins, Telecommunica
tions Technician who also works with
Florence Heuer, Telecommunications
Specialist in the same office in Penn
Hall. The voice mail system may seem
difficult, but it is actually very simple.

which can be heard by people on and Kingston pointed out some help
off campus, Internal, which would be ful items for students to remember. Stu¬

dents will only have 3 minutes of
storage, and after 14 days, the mes
sages will start to be erased begin
ning with the oldest, so students
are encouraged to delete unneces
sary messages. He pointed out that

it is highly recommended to make
an external message so callers
don't have to hear the default mes
sage. When the "mailbox" is 85%
full, the student will be prompted.
How will you know if you
have messages? There will be a
"stutter dial tone" or four short
beeps when you pick up the
phone. To receive messages, call
7400, enter your 5 digit mailbox
number and the # key, and enter

your individual password (which
is 337 and your mailbox number),
and then the # key.
What about the call waiting
feature that we have but many do
not know how to use? Simply
press the switch hook when you
hear a beep and you will be
switched over to the second call.
Repeat the same process to alter
nate between calls.
"Voice mail and e-mail
complement each other. You can
call a professor and say in 15 sec
onds what it might take you 15
minutes to write in an e-mail,"
said Kingston.

the new switch, students can visit

Gettysburg's web site. More detailed
information will be given to students on
the new switch system.
"It will make life a lot easier for a
lot of people if they use this. It is a tool
that will help everyone," said Kingston.

"Connecting Communities" succeeds as
a productive theme for family weekend

By Nadine Hoi-fman
News Editor
Family Weekend '99 saw
a flurry of activities and events
on campus, focusing on the
theme of "Connecting Com
munities" through curriculum
and service-learning projects.
During Saturday's Wel
come Session, Civil Rights Ac
tivists Bob Mants and George
Paris spoke along with
Gettysburg student Lavinia
Rogers on the topic of the
Lowndes County service-learn
ing project. The Alabama
project entails the recording of
oral histories for the purpose
of completing a historic trail
regarding the Civil Rights
Movement of the 1950s and
1960s.

Bob Mants acted as the
former Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee
leader, who provided inspira
tion for a collaboration with
Gettysburg College students as
the director of the Friends of
the Selma to Montgomery
Trail. George Pans, an active
participant in the Civil Rights
Movement, also serves as a host
.for visiting students.
Lavinia Rogers, a senior
at Gettysburg, delivered a poi
gnant speech about her expe
rience in the Lowndes County,
Alabama project, and expressed
that this endeavor has entirely
changed her perspective on life.
She felt drawn to return to the
area over the summer to con
tinue on her quest to help resi
dents share their stories with
the world.

The program included
several powerful clips of oral
histories as recorded by
Gettysburg students.
Following the Welcome
Session was the Center for Pub
lic Service's community ser
vice-oriented GIV Day, in
which approximately 50 par
ents and students convened to
do major repairs on the home
of a local resident. This work
included repairing extensive
ceiling damage and recon
structing the porch of the
house. A street fair was orga
nized by the AME Zion Church
in connection with the service
project.
The "Connecting Com
munities" theme was finalized
with a performance by the
Morgan State Choir, a fifty
member group with a reper¬

toire spanning all genres of
music from gospel to pop. Af
ter delivering the show in the
CUB Ballroom, the Choir re
ceived a standing ovation.
Parents Weekend fea
tured many opportunities for
students to expose their fami
lies to a taste of the best of
Gettysburg, and offered many
ways for them to get involved
in off-campus projects.

Presenting legend Maynard Ferguson

From GCPR
Gettysburg College's Jazz
Appreciation Society will
present the legendary jazz art
ist Maynard Ferguson and his
Big Bop Nouveau Band in con
cert at 8:00 p.m., October 31,
in the Ballroom of the College
Union Building. Tickets for the
concert are $15.00 and are
available at the door. Please
call 717-337-8174 for further
ticket information. Doors will
open at 7:30 p.m.
The Canadian-born
Ferguson began his illustrious
career as a member of the Stan
Kenton Orchestra in the early
1950s after brief stints with
Boyd Rayburn and Tommy
Dorsey. After playing in Eu
rope and India during* the
1960s and 1970s, Ferguson re
emerged on the American scene

as the only jazz artist to ever
record a top-ten single on the
pop charts, "Gonna Fly Now."
He has been a Concords
Records producing and record
ing agent since 1995.
Ferguson has provided a
place for many jazz giants to
begin their careers, such as Don
Ellis, Slide Hampton, Joe
Qawinul, Chick Corea and
Wayne Shorter. He continues
this tradition with his little big
band Big Bop Nouveau, which
is a youthful mix of rising tal
ent. The student-organized
Jazz Appreciation Society was
founded in 1994 to nurture and
advance America's indigenous
musical art form. Jazz artists
who have performed at
Gettysburg College during the
past five years include The
Count Basie Orchestra, Akira

Tana, _Rufus Reid, B Sharp U.S. Navy Commodores
Quartet. Willie Ruff and the

Creepy campuses filled with plenty of ghost stories

By Marco Buscagi ia
TMS Campus
Let's face it — college _can
be a scary place. Students have
to worry about flunking out of
school, running out of money
and catching those pesky sexu
ally transmitted diseases.
Throw a few unhappy ghosts
into the mix and college can be
a downright frightening expe¬

.
"There's just so much
going on in college buildings
when you think about their his
tory, not to mention some of
the high anxieties people have
when they're in school," says
Richard Crowe, a supernatural
phenomena expert based in
Chicago. "Ghosts can thrive on
those anxieties. They can tap
into the worries that people
have." Still, Crowe says most
ghosts just want to be noticed.
"If people pay attention
to them and let them co-exist,
they're usually fine," Crowe
says. "The problems sometimes
start when people try to deny
that they exist in the first
place."
Students may be welcom
ing ghosts without even realiz
ing it. Dennis William Hauck,
a paranormal phenomena ex
pert, says university settings are

the perfect place tor ghosts to
exist. "Usually, behind a lot of
hauntings and ghost cases are
emotions," says Hauck, author
of The National Dnectory of
Haunted Places. "Since there
are so many pressures on stu
dents both in and out of the
classroom, it's understandable
that emotions run high. And
ghosts feed on those emo
tions."
So the next time you hear
something go bump in the
night — and you're sure your

roommate isn't home yet —
you can take some solace in the
fact that when it comes to
creepy campuses, you're not
alone. For years, students at
Mansfield University in
Mansfield, Pa. have maintained
that North Hall is haunted by
Sarah, the ghost of a student
who allegedly committed sui
cide by leaping over a railing
through an open atrium in the
building. According to legend,
Sarah killed herself because of
love gone wrong.

The building, built in
1874, has been vacant for many
years, giving Sarah plenty of
room to roam. Mansfield stu
dents say they sometimes see
Sarah in the windows of the
building's top floor, supposedly
looking for her former lover.
At the University of Illi
nois, students have some blue
mist of their own, often telling
tales of "The Blue Man," the
ghost of a man who allegedly
hanged himself from a tree in
a cemetery just outside of cam
pus. Students say that on nights
with a full moon, they swear
they see a ghost emitting an
eerie blue light.
Students living in North
Spencer residence hall at the
University of North Carolina at
Greensboro may get to know
Annabelle.

Legend has it that
Annabelle is the ghost of a stu
dent who committed suicide in
one of the building's bell tow
ers. And while they don't know
what she's looking for, students
say they sometimes hear her
walking the halls of the dorm.
There have been reports
of a blue haze passing through
the hall at times, as well as ob
jects being flung across differ
ent rooms. The ghost appar
ently gets antsy when the stu¬

dents are gone for the summer,
since most occurrences have
taken place when summer
school students and residence
hall advisers occupy the dorm.
The joe E. Brown and
Eva Mane Saint Theater at
Bowling Green State University
in Ohio is haunted by Alice, an
actress who reportedly was
killed on-stage while playing
Desdemona in Shakespeare's
Othello.
Alice often interferes
with the theater department's
performances by shorting out
the light-

n g
and scat
tering t h e
props,
b u t
only if
she isn't
per
son-ally
in-

vi ted /
to the \
y^^y _^
perfor
mance. So after the final dress
rehearsal of each production,
the director heads to the stage,
where he or she invites the
spirit to be the department's
guest. If asked, the actress al
ways obliges, and the shows
run without any problems.
Fisher Hall at Miami Uni
versity in Oxford, Ohio has a
long history of hauntings.
Throughout stints as a
women's college and a sani
tarium, residents of Fisher Hall
have reported seeing moving
objects and hearing mysterious

.
When the building be
came a freshmen dormitory in
the 1950s, Fisher resident
Ronald Tammen disappeared
from campus. His belongings
were placed in their normal
fashion in his room; his car was
found locked and parked in the
student lot; and his life was
seemingly in perfect order, ac
cording to authorities. A mas
sive nationwide search turned
up nothing, and Tammen was
never found.
A few months later, stu
dents in the dorm often heard
a voice singing in the woods di
rectly behind the building. A
few days later, students saw a

longhaired, tall figure walking
toward the building while sing
ing. Numerous sightings have
taken place in and around the
building, which is now a the
ater. Members of the Delta
Sigma Phi house on the Kansas
State University campus often
experience the final frontier
from their Star Trek-loving
ghost. The building, which was
a hospital before the fraternity
took it over, is home to George,
the ghost of an elderly patient

who died
after falling
off his bed.
He suffo
cated while
wedged be
tween the
bed and the
.¦wall. George
was a big
Star Trek
fan, a fond
ness that
obviously
continues
even after
his death,

say fraternity members. In
1973, an ice storm knocked out
power on the entire KSU cam
pus for several days. But at the
Delta Sigma Phi house, electric
ity was mysteriously restored
every day from 4-5 p.m., just
long enough for George and
the men of Delta Sigma Phi to
catch the Star Trek rerun on a
local station.
James Whitcomb, an In
diana governor in the 1800s,
donated his collection of books
to the DePauw University Li¬

brary in Greencastle, Ind., with
the understanding that they
never leave the building. Ob
viously, Whitcomb meant what
he said.
Although they are listed
as reference books that are sup
posed to stay in the library, stu
dents have occasionally taken
a book or two home with them.
Many of those students have
reported a visiting ghost that
night, possibly Whitcomb, tell
ing them to bring the books
back to the library.

When a new library was
built, Whitcomb's books were
transferred to the site. Students
and library staff have since re
ported seeing books from the
collection floating near their

shelves.
One evening in 1908,16
year-old Condie Cunningham,
a student at the Alabama Girls
Industrial School - now the
University of Montevallo - was
making some fudge with a few
of her hallmates when they
heard their house mother's
strict call for lights out. In their
haste to finish the fudge, the
girls overturned a bottle of al
cohol onto a chafing dish.
Flames leapt up immediately
catching Cunningham's night
gown on fire. She ran down a
hallway, screaming for help.
Running only fanned the
flames. Her death certificate
states that she died two days
later with burns over 75 per
cent of her body.

The story lives on 90
years later, with young women
who live in the same dormitory
claiming to have heard
Cunningham running down the
halls, crying for help. Com
pounding the eerie tale is a
door at the top of the building
that is said to have
Cunningham's panicked face
etched in its wood. The image
appeared shortly after
Cunningham's death and has
continued to appear on every
door that has replaced it since.
Students sneak peeks at the
image etched into the current
door, which was installed 20

years ago.
A 1949 dormitory fire at
Kenyon College in Gambler,
Ohio resulted in the death of
nine men. The fire took place
in the middle of the night, and
the students were trapped af
ter failing to wake up in time
to escape. Since that time, stu
dents in the dorm rebuilt on the
fire's site have reported seeing
legless torsos floating through
the air. Also, students are oc
casionally woken up in the
middle of the night by a shad
owy figure that shakes them,
yelling "Wake me up! Wake me
up!"

Also at Kenyon, a student
who was reportedly killed in a
diving accident in the 1930s
still haunts the school. Despite
the pool being covered and the
facilities altered for a dance
rehearsal site, students still hear
an occasional springboard and
water splashing and then see
wet footprints leading into
where the pool's locker room
once was located.

DiFranco even runs her own

I have a friend who is a big fan of
Ani's, who made a mix tape for
me. So that is all I really know
about her music, but I like the
tape," said Mercadante.
It becomes apparent than,
that DiFranco has really listened

further dis
tancing her
self from the
money-crazy

panies who
are out for ev
erything but

Her label is

course, in
typical
DiFranco
style, she be
gan this at age
19! By doing
so, DiFranco
has praised
the many dif
ferent roles
that women

performances per year, began touring
the following year. Eleven years later,
she is one of the music industry's best
kept secrets. DiFranco encompasses a
variety of different music styles within
her own repertoire - world-music, folk
music, blues, and dance music all show
through in her melodious beats. Gavin
Martin of the Las Vegas Hard Rock Cafe
wrote, "Pulled and beguiled by the
rhythmic undertow, she swims into
darkly reflective space, as snatches of
song break through to the surface."
Students on campus are raving
about SAC's pick. Junior Jon Catlett owns

by many
to have balked at the stei eotypical view
of money hungry musicians who are out
for fame and fortune as opposed to de
livering great music. DiFranco fans
know that every time she perfoims, they
will get what they wanted. Reviewers
rave about DiFranco's music because "it
smacks you across the face and passion
ately reminds you that music was meant
to be lived and experienced." It's not
uncommon to watch fans totally im
merse themselves in her rhyme and
melody.
DiFranco got started early with
her music. She began writing at 15 in
Buffalo, New York - where she was
born. DiFranco, who averages over 200

CDs
and is looking forward to hearing her
in concert on Friday. "I have been a big
fan of DiFianco's music for a couple
years now, and I am very excited about
seeing her perform some of my favor

If you're looking for entertain

you definitely need to check out Ani

DiFranco, a popular option for
the Student Activities Council for sev

Dear Libby,

The LPs need to be cata
loged and checked to see if all
the music in the database is

accurate.
Rodwin Lowe
Dear Rodwin,
You are correct that the
LP collection is not well cata
loged. For those of you who
are wondering what an LP is,
imagine a black vinyl disk,
about twelve inches in diam
eter. These were fondly called
records, before the word
record took on a whole lot of
new meanings. Records came
in a cardboard envelope-like
containers called jackets.
People Libby_'s age collected
them and now mostly have
them in their homes gathering
dust. The library collected LPs
too. So, for all you retro types
who want to have a true his
torical experience, we've got a
marvelous collection of LPs and
turn-tables so you can listen to
your heart's content.

Now, back to Rodwin's
lament. We are slowly replac
ing our LP collection with CDs
as the budget allows, and as
recordings are re-released on
CD. Any of the LPs we decide

to keep will be
fully cataloged.
But fully catalog
ing the approxi
mately 7,000 LPs
in our current
collection, most
of which will be
replaced in the
next few years,
would take an
enormous amount of time.
Libby feels this
time would be
better spent cata
loging the CDs
and other mate
rials that will be
used by our pa
trons for years to
come. B u t

Rodwin, the li
brary staff will be happy to help
you find things in the LP col
lection. We know that it is a bit
of a mystery down there on the
ground floor. Every cataloger
over the years had a different
idea about how to catalog the
LPs and that is why the collec
tion is such a mess. The cur
rent staff had nothing to do
with this nightmare and will be
happy to see if they can unravel
the mystery. Stop by Reference
for help. In the meantime au
dio CDs are fully cataloged in
MUSCAT, but there is always
room for improvement. If you
notice a mistake or problem in
any MUSCAT record, or have
suggestions for improving
MUSCAT, please let Pat Tully,
head of cataloging, know at
campus email address ptully, or
extension x7002.

Hearts to Karen
Drickamer and Christine
Amadure of the Special Collec
tions Department for their

splendid exhibit on the main
floor of the library entitled "A
Taste of Japan: Treasures from
Special Collections." Stop by
and look at the exhibit cases
containing items from the
College's archives and Karen's
own personal collection.
You ' ll see lacquer wear, por
celain, Ukiyo-e prints, ki
mono, obi, geta, zon, fans,
kushi (hair combs)-all of
which are examples of every
day items of traditional Japan
from the Edo period (1603
1868) through the Meiji pe
riod (1868-1912).

Reel Hits & Misses
The story of a
generation

by Barb Dickson
Editor-in-Chief
It's a story that happens
all too often these days: a sub
urban couple, married for fif
teen years with two kids, find
themselves fighting more than
being civil to each other. The
Story of Us takes the audience
through the story of Ben and
Katie Jordan, a California
couple who decides they need
to take a break from married
life. The story begins the night

before Ben
(Bruce
Willis) and
Katie (Michelle
Pfeiffer)
send their
kids Erin
and Josh
off to sum
mer camp.
Though they seem
like the
perfect
Norman Rockwell family, we

soon learn
that all is not well at the Jor
dan household. Through flash
backs we learn of the history
of Ben and Katie's relationship.
The movie quickly cuts be
tween the flashbacks and the
present situation, as Ben and
Katie separate while trying to
figure out the next step. •
The movies shows us Ben
and Katie dealing with life
without each other. We see
them interacting with their
friends and trying to deal with
Family Weekend at summer
camp. And at the end, we see
them...well, you'll have to see
the movie for the ending.
Overall, I enjoyed the
movie. Willis and Pfeiffer per
formed wonderfully in the very
demanding roles of Ben and
Katie. Willis is often in action
roles, and this movie gives him
a chance to show that he can
actually act as well. Pfeiffer,
who has proved her acting abil
ity before in such movies as

Ladybawke and The Fabulous
Baker Boys, once again shows
that she's more than just a
pretty face.
Paul Reiser, director Rob
Reiner, Rita Wilson, and Julie
Hagerty all sho_,w up as Ben and
Katie's friends. None are par
ticularly impressive in their
roles. However, that is just as
much the fault of the script as
that of the actors. These four
great actors are woefully
underused. And on a side note,
it's great to see Julie Hagerty
again, even if she was only in a
couple scenes.

One of my major prob
lems with this movie is that it
focuses too much on Ben and
Katie's current problems and
we don't see enough of the hap
pier days in the past. While we
see how the couple met, we
really aren't shown the foun
dations of the relationship. I
found myself rooting for the
couple, I wanted to know more
of their background. We see
too much of their fighting mo
ments and not enough of the
happy moments.
And when we do see the
happy moments, it's far too
brief. The previews showed a
montage of clips of Ben, Katie
and their kids in various stages
of development. We do see
those images in the movie...in
the same montage. I would like
to know the stories behind
those scenes. Instead, the
movie chooses to focus on the
desperate state Katie and Ben

are now

The movie also continues
the craze of having the charac
ters speak directly to the cam
era. Reiner used this technique
much more effectively in his an
earlier movie When Harry Met
Sally... There seems to be very
little point to the little synop
ses and comments Ben and
Katie give us. The movie could
survive very well without their
insights.
The plot of the movie is
a very emotionally wrenching
one. The vast majority of the
movie is spent witnessing Ben
and Katie fighting with each
other.

While my par
ents are
still mar
ried,
t h e
movie
could
be a
very
hard
one to
watch
for the
many people
whose

parents are divorced. But af
ter watching this movie, I be
gin to wonder just what is go
ing on between my parents be
hind closed doors (and on an
other side note, these kids
seemed a little too oblivious as
to what was going on).
I did enjoy The Story of
Us. It's an emotionally grip
ping story that is very well-per
formed by the two leads. How
ever, you have to be in the right
mood to see it and get anything
out of it. So when you see the
very mixed reviews this movie
has gotten, remember two
things: a) It's a movie about
emotions and relationships,
which leads to the words "chick
flick," and b) You really have
to be in the right mood to en
ioy this movie.

Overall, I thought this
was a good movie, but not one
I'd want to bring a significant
other to. I give it three and a
half stars out of five.

Hug your heart

by Cara Leone and
Krista Moyer
Contributing Wri i _erj>
Cardiovasculai disease
(CVD) is the number one killer
in the U.S. Each year 500,000
people die of heart disease. For
each person that dies, ten more
people (over 6 million) will
have symptoms of heart dis
ease. About three times the
number who die (1.5 million
people) suffer from heart at
tacks with one third of them
being fatal. Each year over $47
billion has been spent in health
care for CVD. Although it
seems to affect older individu
als, heart disease is caused by
long term results of various
lifestyle behaviors practiced in
the college years. Therefore,
what you do to your body now
will contribute to your health
in the future.

CVD is a term referring
to diseases associated with the
heart and blood vessels. It is
caused by a number of factors.
The risk factors include age,
genetics, high blood choles
terol, gender, high blood pres
sure, diabetes, smoking, obe
sity, stress, and physical inac
tivity. Many of these risks can
be controlled through lifestyle.
The two ways most pertinent
to college students are not
smoking and performing regu-

lai physical activity.
One risk factor of heart
disease that can be controlled
is smoking. Smokers fact* two
to four times, the risk of a heart
attack than nonsmokers have.
There are also chemicals in
cigarette smoke that can induce
a heart attack by promoting
complete blockage of an artery.
Nicotine also effects your pulse
rate. It tightens up the blood
vessels in your arms and legs.
It also reduces your HDL (good
cholesterol) level.
The carbon monoxide in

smoke gets into your red blood
cells and binds to the hemoglo
bin, which prevents the cells
from carrying oxygen. You
know how in the past, some
NFL football players have
breathed oxygen between
downs? They keep an oxygen
tank at the sidelines. They are
trying to fill their blood with
oxygen'. Basically, the carbon
monoxide in cigarette smoke
does the opposite. The smoke
has a much higher level of car
bon monoxide than you'd get
from all but the most intense
traffic pollution.

For exercise to be effec
tive in developing fitness, it
must follow the principle of
regularity, which means that it
must be done frequently
enough, with enough intensity,
and for a sufficient period of
time. Exercise must be per¬

formed regularly to be effec
tive. On the average, a person
should exercise three to five
times per week. Exercise
should also be hard enough to
require more exertion than
normal, as measured by your
heart rate, in ortlei to produce
an improvement in fitness. An
exercise period should be 30 to
90 minutes long, and some ex
perts even accept 20 minutes of
vigorous exeicise as a useful
standard. Many studies show
that daily low intensity exercise
also reduces blood pressure sig
nificantly.
Physical fitness is defi
nitely worth the effort. When
you exercise regularly, you feel
better and look better. At the

same time, you will also feel
more relaxed and energetic.
Even when you are tired or
unenthusiastic about things,
exercise will help turn those
feelings around and give you
more energy. Perhaps most im
portant, the long-term benefits
to your health from exercise
are enormous. Exercise helps
reduce the CVD risk factors
such as high cholesterol, high
blood pressure, and stress, and
helps control diabetes. Exercise
can also retard the aging pro
cess and keep you fit and
healthy longer. Few things in
life are as beneficial to physi
cal and mental well being as a
regular program of exercise
and physical fitness.

Device cleans up tv's dirty words

by Jim Jones
Knight-Ridder
Newspapers
When Tommy Lee Jones
yells at a character to get his
big... let's call it "posterior" ...
back in the house in a scene
from Men In Black, a new de
vice called Curse Free TV
changes the wording consider
ably. Jones' spoken word is
muted; a cleaned-up, closed
caption version appears in text
on the TV screen; and Jones'
line becomes "Get your big toe
back in the house."
Curse Free TV, a small
black computerized box now

being marketed nationwide by
Life Way Christian Stores, auto
matically filters out "more than
100 foul words and phrases,"
a brochure explaining the gad
get states.
"This is what many fami
lies have been looking for," said
Matt Jaggers, manager of the
LifeWay Christian Store in
North Richland Hills, who
demonstrated the device there.
The LifeWay outlets,
which are owned by the South
ern Baptist Convention, are the
first major marketers of the
device, which sells for $149.95.
But it will be available to other
Christian stores and retail out
lets, said Mike Saloni, a spokes
man for Curse Free TV, based
in suburban New Orleans.

Saloni said about 10,000
of the systems have been sold
since they became available
four months ago.
The program works by
filtering offensive words from
closed-caption signals. It works
with TVs, VCRs, satellite re
ceivers and cable box devices.
It does not work on live pro
gramming or when closed
captioning is not available on
videos or TV programs.
When the box is set to
"strict and religious" setting, it
removes the words "God,
Lord, Jesus Christ" when used
in exclamations. For example,
if a character says, "Oh my
God," the phrase is shortened
to "Oh my."
Another switch on the

Curse Free electronic box puts
"God, Jesus, Lord" and
"Christ" back into the audio
when the viewer tunes into a
sermon or other religious pro
gram. Slang words for excre
ment, urine and sexual inter
course are left out entirely, usu
ally without any substitutes.
The Rev. Jonas
Robertson, pastor of the 1,000
member Abundant Life World
Outreach Center in Harvey,
La., a nondenominational evan
gelical church outside New
Orleans, collaborated with Rick
Bray, president of a software
firm in Rogers, Ark., to develop
Curse Free TV.
Bray had already invented
a device called TV Guardian

that filtered out some objec
tionable words. Then he and
Robertson took it a step further
to eliminate as much offensive
language as possible.
During development of
the Curse Free system, several
pastors and their wives spent
several hours discussing bad
words and suggesting substi
tutes, Robertson said.
"It was a day in the bow
els of hell," he said. "We had
to think of all the curse words
we ever knew."
Still, words some people
might find objectionable slip
through. And the program
can't do anything about the pic
tures on the screen, so nudity
and other scenes that may be
objectionable still appeal.

Save the trees

The immediate reason
for the campaign is to show
the Clinton-Gore administra
tion and Forest Service Chief
Dombeck that the public sup
ports the implementation of
such protective policies for
our forests. This is especially
important in the next few
months because in March, an
18month moratorium was
placed on road building in
many of these National For
ests in order to give the For
est Service a period in which
to review its policies on the
management of these forests.
In cooperating with

PIRG, GECO has been post
carding in the CUB and else
where, asking the students
and faculty of Gettysburg
College to simply fill our
prewritten postcards that we
then send on to the Forest
Service to show them our
concern. Our goal for this
campaign is 1000 postcards,
and we are well on our way
with over 600. If you would
like to fill out a postcard,
please call the GECO office
at x7537 and leave your name
and mailbox number. If you
would like to participate in
the email campaign, or if you
would like more information

Each day, in the United
States, 1000 old growth trees
are cut down. With only 4%
of the ancient forests of
America remaining, it is easy
to see how important it is to
stop this devastation of one of
our most treasured national re¬

sources.
It is with this in mind
that the Gettysburg Environ
mental Concerns Organization
(GECO) has been assisting the
State PIRGS (Public Interest
Research Groups) in their
Heritage Forests Campaign.
The goal of this campaign is to
pressure the Forest Service to
implement policies that would
protect our remaining national
heritage forests from destruc
tion caused by logging, clear
cutting, road-building, mining

and oil drilling. These prac
tices cause not only the de
struction of the natural habi
tats of the wildlife of these for
ests, but also erosion, water
contamination, and dangerous
landslides. Protecting our for
ests now will help to preserve
them for the enjoyment of fu
ture generations and for our
own. It will also protect the
health of the communities sur
rounding the forests and the
stability of the species that rely
on these forests.

Letters to the Editor

Congratulations on a
fabulous weekend
I wish to congratulate the faculty,
staff and students of Gettysburg
College for the outstanding parents
weekend just concluded. You have
much to be proud of - tradition, excel
lent programs, athletic achievements,
and an outstanding college newspaper.
We especially appreciated the wonder
ful dinner buffet at Servo and the fan
tastic performance by the Morgan State
Choir. The history making perfor
mance by Paul Smith capped a wonder
ful weekend. Keep up the good work.
Sincerely,
Fred and Linda Dickson

Column expresses
ambigous support for
rights
In response to Rachel Hanson's col
umn in the October 21 issue of The
Gettysburgian, I seriously wonder
what kinds of rights she believes in: she
claims to be in favor of women's rights,
but this is questionable; she most defi
nitely does not believe in the basic hu
man right to live, as exhibited by her
belief that unborn babies should be mur
dered; and, finally, it seems that she fa
vors special rights for criminals rather
than their victims.
She spends her entire column at
tacking the Unborn Victims of Violence
Act. This bill, which will no doubt be
vetoed by President Clinton (who we
all know has enormous respect for
women), would allow criminals who
attack pregnant mothers to be held ac
countable for injury done to the devel
oping life inside the mother's womb.
One would think most women would
champion this bill as a victory for
women's rights and that any person

Class officers are fulfilling
their duties
I would like to comment on the Oc
tober 21 Letter to the Editor ad
dressing the absenteeism of the se
nior class president. The letter should
not be considered the opinion of the
majority of our class.
Yes, the president's absence is an
obstacle for the class; however this is
the very reason we voted for four offic
ers instead of just one. As with any for
mal governing cabinet, the position de
scription for the vice president is to as
sume the responsibilities and obligations
of the president in his absence. These
measures are currently in place in or

Students must take
responsibility for ignorance
T he Editorial Board recently as
serted that Gettysburg students
remain oblivious to politics and
natural disasters (Consider This, Octo
ber 21). If students truly "do not have
the time to worry about the issues fac
ing the rest if the world," then we have
a reason to feel alarmed.
We do not, however, have the
right to accuse College faculty members
of depriving us of news, as did The Get
tysburgian: "the faculty and administra
tion ... have a responsibility to see that
students are aware of what continues
to make the world run on a daily ba
sis." Teachers have no responsibility to
foster their students' awareness of cur
rent events!
If students truly want to know
what occurs outside of Gettysburg, all
we have to do is pick up a newspaper
or hook up to the Internet. If we do
not, we have only ourselves to blame.
Sincerely,
Allison Small '03

Consider This

Saturday's football victory was accompanied by a massive out
pouring of school spirit on behalf of students, parents and the Bullet
Marching Band. Why does this only happen on Family Weekend?
Both the football team and the band would love to see the stands

visiting moms and dads. Perhaps the football team would win more

If Gettysburg could defeat 5-1
Muhlenberg, with a full house we might be able
to rout other foes as well. Besides, there are
few better things to do on a crisp autumn day
than watch live football!
As for the band, there are very few small
liberal arts schools in the Northeast that fea
ture a marching band. Watching a great half
time show along with Division III football is a
unique part of the Gettysburg experience.
Students should experience our football/
marching band combination at least once in
their four years here, but the attendence on
Saturdays is usually quite low.
What this comes down to is not only a
matter of school spirit, but one of personal en
richment. Last week, we commented on the
"bubble" that some belive exists on our cam

seems too much to hope for.

Going to a football, field hockey or soc

A PORTRAIT OF TH E COLUMNIST AS A YOUNG MAN
The senseless ramblings of someone who has aged fifty years since he came to

by i.a. isherwood
Social Critic
I was not a heavy smoker
until I came to college. I never
drank coffee or watched Full
Metal Jacket more than once in
a night either. In addition, I
never really had a four-hour
conversation about absolutely
nothing until I found the Lin
coln Diner. I gained weight,
lost my sense of self, then found
it again only to discover that I
really didn't like my personal
ity all that much. I courted
campus issues, often flirting
with disaster, and left for a year

Incomina thoughts

Gettysburg: Chapter One

to find the world outside of
Gettysburg. I once took pride
in personal hygiene, but that
desire for cleanliness soon dis
sipated after the first all
nighter. Through all of this
over the last three years, the
orange and blue sky of Gettys
burg has been in my memory.
As I sit to write this on
the library steps I realize all of
the little things that really an
noy the hell out of me. For in
stance I still get annoyed when
people are too cheerful. People
like that really can't be trusted.
When the leaves turn color we
get all excited. Honestly
though, how would you feel if
the nutrients in your skin were
slowly dying and the only thing
you had to look forward to was
a fall to your death only to be
raked up and beaten down into
a plastic bag. Life sucks for the
leaves who are constantly
linked to the arms (or branches)
of oppression. Nobody thinks
of the little guy anymore.

And then there is that
whole conversation which be¬

gins with someone saying "you
shouldn't smoke - it's bad for
you." No, I really didn't know
that inhaling fire could cause
serious damage to my health.
Another issue is bath
room graffiti. I have rarely
witnessed more mundane and
stupid writings in bathrooms
than at this college. Even the
occasional limerick is hard to
find amidst the usual "call so
and-so for a good time" or the
typically juvenile "my frat is
better than yours" vandalism.
That sort of thing wasn't even
funny in high school, but for
some people the temptation to
show their literary prowess in
public is too much to resist. I
never knew that we had so
many poets proficient in the
Greek language.

Into all this mess comes
the petty small talk, in which
everyone engages. "Hi! How
are you? That looks good on
you! Isn't the day beautiful?"
Well, I was enjoying the beau
tiful day until this conversation
interrupted my meditation. I

am not saying that these aren t
important questions to ask, but
many times the interrogator
really doesn't care all that much
about the answers given. The
comments are sparse and petty,
and the tone of the voices usu
ally annoying. Then again,
maybe I am just frustrated and
bitter from the nights of poor
rest and the abuse of caffeine
to maintain my mental stabil
ity mid-semester. Or maybe
because I am never asked (sub
liminal request for pity).

The one comment I de
spise hearing is the old "I pay a
lot of money to go here and I
expect better." Now, I am just
as guilty as the next guy of us
ing this phrase, but it is truly a
ridiculous statement. The ma
jority of students here do not
actually pay for their own edu
cation. In addition, we get a
hell of a lot from the College
in return. A beautiful campus
in a relatively safe area is a fac
tor which should not be ig
nored. A largely caring and
highly professional faculty

which provide personal
mentorship (don't forget, we
are here to learn). As many ac
tivities as there are days and or
ganizations for just about ev
ery political and social opinion.
Finally, a first rate newspaper
with a talented staff and numer
ous social and political colum
nists reflecting the mood and
opinions of the student body
(shameless plug). So the phrase
should read "my parents pay a
lot of money for me to be mad
at the fact that the ketchup was
not put out immediately after I
used the last spoonful at the
Bullet Hole." Get over it!
Now in conclusion I am
outraged that only a handful of
people participated in the first
annual National Bandana Day
last week. It was an opportu
nity to show pride in the coun
try which offers the right for
every person within our realm
to wear a bandana. I was
shocked when I stared across
the campus and saw heads bar-

Time through a window

by Jeph McGowan
Columnist
How fleeting is time?
The leaves outside the window
have faded from green to all
shades of red and yellow, ush
ering in a new day and a new
season and a whole new per
spective. Soon, the days will
become even colder, the leaves
will be gone, and the landscape
will be covered in white,
draped in a soft snow, the
world curled up in the sheets
of winter.
Remember the hot,
muggy days of summer, the
warming days of spring? What
were you doing then? How
long ago was that? Not too
long after all. If it seems like
Yesterday, it's because it was.

Time moves along like it's on a time ago, when I poked my

slip and slide, not a care or a
thought in the world.
Staring out the window
not too far from now, you will
see the beautiful glistening
landscape with a perfect shim
mer covering the once green
and lively world.
Think about the past.
Think about the future. Do
you remember something that
happened to you that you wish
would happen again? Can you
find an event that you want to
forget, something you regret?
Think back on the days
that seemed so long then, that
seemed like they 'd never end,
that seemed like they went too
fast for you. They're always
the best ones, the ones that you
knew you loved but went too
quickly for you to hold on to.
I think back to just some

head into the hallway early one
Saturday, and the future of me
peered back from behind its
safeguard, embarrassed to be
seen but elated to be there.
Some moments you hold
onto not because you think to
ahead of time, but because you
know that something about
them is right, you can feel the
impact the moment has on the
days to follow. What the im
pact is, you can't be sure.
How fast things change,
but how much you want them
to. What causes so much dis
tress is when you hold tight to
the past and can't let go, be
cause you have too much to
lose if you do.
The future is one dark
monstrous mass looming on
the horizon, amorphous and
enigmatic, but strangely warm
and inviting. It can be anything

unlike the past which is carved
in stone and displayed for all
to see. You future, your com
ing days, hold silently your
prayers of a sunrise you'd like
to see, of something special you
want, of someone special you'd
like to hold.
Your heartfelt wishes re
main there - locked away inside
forever. They become a part
of you, what you long to be
come. Sometimes they are bur
ied in the depths of the con
science, pushed away by the
currents of time and circum
stance, standing as memories of
a lost self or lost time.
Something to hold onto,
or something to release; they
are something essential to who
we are. What you wish, what
you dream, for what you hope,
defines you. What do you wish
for?

Days will come and go,
dancing their fateful dance
across the stage set before your
eyes. Only the few precious
ones can you remember with
clarity: days in which some
thing monumental occurred, of
a day in which nothing extraor
dinary happened at all.
When the sun finally
comes up over the horizon, a
new day and a new memory
will be forged. Will you re
member it after it's gone? Will
today be the day your dreams
and hopes are answered? Will
your hopes and dreams
change?
The sun rising high above
represents potential, unrealized
and raw. Only another day will
tell how this one will turn out.

Every time I look away, the fu
ture smiles back at me. I like
the smile I get.

Be thankful for the system

by John Dunlap
Political Columnist
We are coming upon the
political season and once again
the famous buzzwords "bipar
tisan" and the "system is bro
ken" are being unleashed. I will
let you all know up front that
nothing annoys me more than
those on both sides of a politi
cal aisle, or those individuals
who are on no side of the par
tisan debate who complain
about partisan fighting and the
cost of campaigns.

We are extremely lucky in
the United States; we have the
oldest surviving Constitution in
the world, a Constitution that
at its basis is confrontational.
Our founders set up three
branches of government, a leg
islative, an executive, and a ju
dicial branch that have a duty
to check one another. No one
branch is allowed to be too
powerful, and if one goes be
yond the limits set upon it, than
the other branches can and
s.

on
this planet of ours we do not
fight over government in the
streets. Our forbearers did that
over two hundred years ago
when they fought against the
British for our freedom. A little
under one hundred years after
the Revolution, another revo
lution of sorts took place: the
Civil War, and much of the de
bate over federalism and where
our Constitution stood was
settled.
The system that those

Americans died for was a sys
tem whereby the fighting in the
streets that so many countries
are plagued with would be
done by words in the halls of
Congress and before the courts.
Since the battle over the ratifi
cation of the Constitution, two
political factions have wrestled
to control policy. Congress is
based around debate, and to
day those sides are very con
frontational as they argue the
great issues of the day. We live
in a system where Ted Kennedy

and Jesse Helms can debate and
argue all day if they want in the
United States Senate, but after
the debate is over, fighting does
not go to the streets, it goes on
to be argued before the Su
preme Court, or sent to the
White House.
Because something is bi
partisan does necessarily mean
it is good. Usually when poli
ticians on both sides of the po
litical aisle get together to do
something bipartisan the
people of America better watch
their wallets. You can be sure
some tax is going to be raised
or another regulation imple
mented. A perfect example is
the transportation bill that
called for a massive overhaul of
the nation's roads. It was bi
partisan, passed _^^^^^_h|_m
by a Re- _^^^ _f_^M
publi- _^B _^^_A m
can Kb j_^_M _h
Con- _^IBflB_^Bfll
gress _hhh_^_hhm
and _^^^^^^^^^^
signed _^^^^^^^^^^^
into law _^^^Hl_^
by the _^
- _^^

cratic President in 1998. The
bill was filled with an unprec
edented amount of pork, which
robbed the American people.
Partisan debate should have
won and a fierce debate should
have taken place, perhaps sav
ing us a few dollars.
My other great annoy
ance is those who _criticize the
money involved with politics
and complain about our broken
system. The only thing broken
about our system is that more
money cannot be raised. A
limit was set after Watergate,
which has allowed for one
thousand dollar maximum do
nations for a political cam
paign. Twenty-five years later
with the inflation that has taken
place no change has been made.
People seeking office have to
spend all of their time attempt
ing to _rouijd up one-thousand
dollar donations, which in a
presidential campaign mean
little when you're talking about
television and radio. To Gov¬

ernor George W. Bush's credit,
he has been able to raise an un
precedented amount of funds
within these legal limits. This
says a lot for the Governor's
extremely broad appeal.
People like Senator John
McCain, a Republican running
for president, constantly com
plain about the money in the
political process and the abuse
in the system, but another Re
publican senator, Mitch
McConnell, challenged
McCain to give the names of
these offenders. We should not
go back to the days when Wil
liam McKinley could be elected
President through the funds of
a few _^^. m-

^^^^^^^^^ als and
_^^^^H^^^^ we should
H_^Hr _^ not go to a gov
t_^m_^m ernment-financed
_^^^ m system like some lib
^^_T era ls want. I am not
I exactly sure what John
McCain wants, but I do be
heve that if the law is fol
lowed like it usually is then
politicians are not that swayed
by who gives them money. Phil
Gramm and Jesse Helms are
not conservative because con
servative causes give to their
campaigns; conservative causes
give to them because they are
conservatives. The same is true
on the other side of the politi
cal aisle.
It is expensive to run a
political campaign and if dona
tions are allowed to be greater,

then more voters could be
reached increasing the political
franchise. We are looking in
the wrong direction when criti
cizing our political system; the
problem is not the legal system
but the abuse of the law. When
talking about abuse of the law
it is no surprise that we go back
to Bill Clinton and Al Gore,
foreign money, and raising
funds in Buddhist Temples as
Vice President Gore did. They
are the real outrage and that is
where the focus should be.

Political Columnist

pres
d e n 11 a 1
contender
over Vice
President
Al Gore. In

the past
months

, few 9 _^
, Bradley has made ma
jor strides in his campaign for
the Democratic nomination.
During the third quarter, Bra
dley collected more fundraising
donations than Al Gore. He has
also gained more support in the
politically important states of
New Hampshire and New
York, as well as others across
the nation. He is attracting
larger crowds at each of his
numerous campaign appear¬

ances. I will be honest when I
say that Bradley's gain in sup
port does not mean that he is
anywhere close to beating Gore
in the polls. But Bradley has
turned Gore's campaign from
a campaign against George W.
Bush (since Gore mistakenly
assumed that he would receive
the nomination with no con
test) into a campaign where
Gore is concentrating on the
Democratic opposition.
Bradley's gain in support
means that the American pub
lic is also sick of the predict¬

able choice of the vice presi
dent as the obvious candidate.
With the spectacle this presi
dential race is becoming, it is
obvious that people are look
ing for new options in candi
dates. The names that the press
are concentrating on as "un
conventional" candidates are
Warren Beatty, Donald Trump,
and Pat Buchanan. Bill Brad
ley is not attracting as much
press as these new Reform
Party members are getting, but
he is a more logical option than
this crew of so-called politi
cians. Bradley was actually a
U.S. Senator for 18 years; he
didn't just play one on TV (or

should I say film). And Brad
ley resides in New Jersey in

in his spare time. And as for

A spider web, not a safety net

by Dan Ballentyne
Columnist
This is the first in a series
of articles in which I will ex
plore various aspects of Ameri
can liberalism and point out the
myths of liberalism, especially
the myth that liberals "care" or
are "compassionate." This first
article

will deal
with the
myth that
liberals "care"
about the
poor and
that so
cial pro
grams are
meant to
help the
poor.
ever the
issue of
welfare reform
takes to
the na
t i o n a 1
stage, we
always
hear lib¬

erals make statements like "We must
preserve the safety net." This
sounds well and good, but it's
not a safety net that they are
interested in preserving, but a
spider web. A spider web that
traps the poor in its clutches
and does it's best to never let
them go_.
When liberals look at
Johnson's Great Society and
War on Poverty, they think how
great it was the Johnson was
"finally" doing something to
"help" the poor and downtrod
den in America. However, did
poverty decrease? No, with the
exception of decline in the
1980's due to the polices of
Ronald Reagan, poverty did
not decrease. In fact, it has
gone up at times. Did they seek
to change polices that clearly
were nnt _working? No.

Before we go on to dis
cuss why they did not change
these policies, we should dis
cuss how they funded these
policies. How they did it is
simple, they raised taxes on
everyone. They took more
money out of the pockets of
working Americans and busi
nesses. This resulted in busi
nesses laying off _employees and

forcing them to go on govern
ment assistance, which would
eventually cost more and
would lead to higher taxes and
a repetition of the scenario.
Also, Americans who keep their
jobs have less money to pump
into the economy and busi
nesses lose even more money
and contribute to even more to
people losing their jobs. But
every time that Republicans call
for across the board tax cuts,
or tax cuts for everyone
equally, do liberals support it?
No. They still want to have
across the board tax increases,
like the Clinton Tax Increase of
1993, which passed in a Demo
cratic Congress without a single
Republican vote, and continue
to contribute to the cycle.
Why, then do liberals in
sist on keeping their failed po¬

lices? The answer is simple, and
illustrates the "uncompassion'"
of liberalism. They wish to cre
ate for themselves a permanent
voter base that they can scare
into fearing that they will be
left out of the cold if liberals
are not in control of the gov
ernment. They constantly talk
about how conservatives are
for the rich (which is false and

I am living proof
of that), are out to
keep them poor,
and that they (the
liberals) will pro
tect them. How
ever, it's liberal
welfare programs
that keep the poor
dependant on
government, and
therefore keep
them poor. They
do not allow
people to start
their own busi
nesses, or they
lose their benefits
immediately, and
cannot run their
businesses. They
kick people out of
public housing,
which is never
properly main
tained properly, if

they make above a certain in
come, which does not have to
be enough to get a new place
to live. Meanwhile, conserva
tives want work requirements
on welfare, as well as job train
ing, to allow the poor to get
jobs. They want to lower taxes
to create jobs and wealth.
Which of these sound compas
sionate to you?
The evidence clearly
shows that liberals do not care
about the poor, but about mak
ing token gestures to feel good
about themselves and creating
for themselves a permanent
voter base. Selfishness, not
compassion, dictates liberal
policy on taxes and welfare. To
help the poor, we must get to
gether and elect conservatives
that will swat the spider web
and setup the safety net.

life would agree with its passage, but not Ms. Hanson. Just lis
ten to the name of the bill and decide what her views are. She is
attacking "unborn victims" while defending the violent offend
ers. So, it seems as though there is little we can do about this
matter, as it will surely either die in the Senate or be vetoed by
our model of feminine respect, President Clinton. However, as
Ms. Hanson attempts to use her flawed argument to persuade
you to vote a certain way, I will simply ask you to use common
sense and vote for candidates in 2000 who maintain a respect
for human life and women's rights, and do not try to further
victimize those who are already victims by defending their at
tackers. I hope you will take this to heart.

Spotting sexism in our society

by Rachel Hanson
COLUMNrST
As a Women's Studies
major, I have spent countless
hours, days, even weeks study
ing the position of women in
society and feminism's re
sponse to these problems. This
past weekend I was given the
opportunity to add a personal
experience to my extended
educational and growth period
to becoming a better feminist,
and, in turn, a better person.
Since it was Family Week
end, I decided to take my par
ents to one of my favorite es
tablishments in town for din
ner (the name of which I
choose not to reveal). There
was a large crowd of people in
line, but after a few minutes,
those in front of us decided to
eat elsewhere, so all that re
mained in line were my parents
and I and another student and
his parents who had just ar
rived.

The host (whom I believe
was also either the manager or
the owner) then came out to
take our names. I told him
there were three in our party
and my name and he moved on
to the people behind us with
out saying anything to me. The
father of the student behind us
gave their name and told him
that they also had three in their
party (for privacy interests, I
will call them the Smiths).

The host then said to the
father, "Okay, Mr. Smith, we
will do our best to get you a
table as soon as possible. It
should be a wait of no more
than 30 to 40 minutes. And,
please, help yourself to a drink
from the bar while you wait."
The host then went back into
the restaurant.
I think that it is fairly ob
vious as to where I am going
with this story. This is the most
blatant example of sexism in
my life thus far. The host felt
it was necessary to make the
man behind me feel comfort
able and that his business was
appreciated, while I was made
to feel that I was yet another in
a long line of pushy customers
that night, just because I was a
woman.

As I have said in many of
my previous columns, women
are not even near where they
should be in society. My recent
experience is just one in the
many that occur each day all
over the United States, a coun
try that claims to have total
equality for the sexes.
Many times sexism oc
curs in seemingly small in
stances and often feels "nor
mal " in life. Thus, those that
are being discriminated against,
and often those who discrimi
nate, do not even realize that it
is happening. However, it is
the combination of these "mi
nor" things that add up to the

great discrimination women
face in our society. Ask your
self which of the following
things you or someone you
know has either been the vic
tim of, witnessed, or even done
yourself.
A class where the
thoughts and ideas of women
are taken less seriously than
those of men. A professor or
director who only acknowl
edges the presence of men in a
group of both sexes. A woman
who is treated as a sex object
or is forced to be more sexu
ally reserved just because she is
female. A person who feels that
the education of a woman is
less important than that of a
man, because, after all, she will
"only" go on to be a wife and
mother.

These are all instances,
that occur on a regular basis.
In order to change this, people
need to first realize that sexism
can come from either a man or
a woman. They also need to
be able to identify sexism as
such when it occurs. They then
need to try to change society
themselves by pointing out to
a person when they have acted
in a sexist manner. They also
need to become more aware of
sexism that they themselves
commit. If everyone can do
this, society will slowly go
through a very radical, though
also necessary and beneficial,
change.

Announcements
Jackson Katz will be speaking in the ballroom at 7:30
tonight, Thursday, October 28. His lecture deals with Ameri
can manhood and violence against women. The event is being
sponsored by Alpha Delta Pi and the Women's Center. TKE
will be hosting a reception after the lecture. Everyone is in
vited to attend.
On Saturday, October 30th, there will be a Haunted
House open to community children. The event is being hosted
at the Phi Kappa Psi house between 6 and 8 p.m.

Duties

three other elected officials
should have realized and pre
pared for their new responsi
bilities under the president's
absence.
Saying this, I must dis
agree with the student's state
ment that the officers have
been forced to handle the re
sponsibilities of the president.
There were no unwarranted
obligations given to them.
They are simply being asked to
fulfill their duties as the class
cabinet.
Secondly, I believe the
dangerous precedent being set

-continued from page 11 -
here is that of priorities. The
reason most of us came to Get
tysburg College was to experi
ence new ideas both academi
cally and socially. The presi
dent is accomplishing this in
Denmark. How can we criti
cize him for taking advantage
of the opportunities offered to
us? Are they not the reason we
pay to attend college at Gettys
burg? Extracurricular activities
are just that, extra, and should
not interfere with academic
pursuits. They should be
viewed secondary to a well-

rounded education. This was
not an irrational decision on his
part. He made preparations for
events and relied on the energy
and competence of the senior
class and its officers for imple
mentation. I believe that this
was neither inappropriate not
outrageous to ask of us.
We as a senior class
should not question his motive
or decision to go abroad, but
instead support him in his ef
forts to develop academically.
Sincerely,
A Member of the Senior Class

Volleyball inches closer to bid with victory over Hopkins

continued from page

teamwork and strong offense
to carry them through. Their
offense worked because the
defense was reliable.
Wargo was responsible
tor 20 digs, and junior Mary
Guay contributed eight. Also,
Evans, a setter, was able to get
to the ball to set the offense
very well, with 38 assists for the
match.
After being tied at 7-7,
Johns Hopkins pulled ahead to
an 11-8 lead.
The Bullets stopped
them, and Guay served the next
four points. Johns Hopkins
answered this with two points
of their own, pushing their

had misunderstood the call,
which had been in Hopkins'
favor. ' Johns Hopkins was
awarded the additional point to
create a tie game once again.
Gettysburg took a
timeout at 12-13, and eventu
ally regained control of the
game. At 14-13, Hopkins used
a timeout but could not keep
Gettysburg from their fifteenth
point. Game three was interest
ing once again thanks to
Hopkins' coach Weidenborner.
The match stopped again at 3
5 for his second yellow card of
the evening, due to another re¬

mark about the officiating.
This resulted in a red card for
him and a point for Gettysburg.
The game resumed and so
did the Bullets' momentum.
Gettysburg used their great

score to 14 and leaving Gettys
burg with 12.
Schott put down a kill
from the middle, and Gettys
burg eventually tied the score
at 14-14. A f ter several more

sideouts, the~*Bullets made the
score 16-14 on Kamin's block.
Schott said, "We played excep
tionally well against Hopkins."
The Bullets did not fare
so well at the Emory Invita
tional in Atlanta, Georgia on
Friday and Saturday.
First-year Jessica
Wininger commented, "This
weekend was tough; we faced
hard competition."
Friday the Bullets faced
Emory and lost 3-0 (15-8, 15
6, 15-6). The Bullets needed
to adjust to the higher caliber

or teams they
were facing, and
were not ready
for it in the first
match of the
weekend.
The Bul
lets succeeded
in p u in p l n a

23
themselves up for the remain
der of the matches and played
with noticeable improvement.
Although they lost the second
match of the day to Savannah
College of Art and Design, they
won two of the games. Get
tysburg lost the fifth game and
the match with Savannah's 15
12 victory.
On Saturday, the Bullets
lost to Southwestern 0-2) and
Ohio Northern (31), but the
games showed the team's abili
ties. Schott put down 60 kills
between these two matches. In

the Southwestern match, she
surpassed her own record of 31
kills to make it 35. The Bullets
also played great defense
throughout the weekend, led
by Wargo.
Assistant coach Ken
Armacost stated, "The week
end was good. They played
great competition. I think it's
good for us in the long run.
We'll see the dividends in the
future."
The Bullets' record stands
at 19-13, and 9-0 in the Cen
tennial Conference.

In a showdown, you take
six paces, turn, and shoot. You
hope the other guy spills more
blood than you do.
On October 27, Gettys
burg came out on top in the
duel against Johns Hopkins
with a major win. They man
aged to inflict four lethal
wounds while walking away
with only two themselves.

Bullets rise above Blue Jays in conference battle

the most crucial games of the
season unraveled. The Bullets
wasted no time in getting down
to business, which has been
characteristic of their play
lately. Sophomore Mike
McLaughlin said, "We tried to
jump on them the first couple
of minutes." Although there
were no 30-second goals, the
first goal was scored by senior
Adam Outerbridge in the first
10 minutes, off of a beautiful
assist by senior Chris Pyor. -

Junior Jeremy Shapiro
was the next Bullet to score. A
Hopkins player answered,
bringing the score to 2-1 before
the half was ended.
Outerbridge did not take
too long to score again, and
then senior Jason Vishio fin
ished them off. The same
Hopkins player managed to

find the back of the net a sec
ond time, for the Blue Jays last
goal. The style of play was very
physical, as shown by the many
cards handed out. In fact,
Vishio's goal came from a di
rect kick that the Blue Jays
weren't prepared for.
McLaughlin said, "They

Sophomore Brett Kelly brings the ball back into action against a rough Johns Hopkins squad

had some size on us, so we
stepped up the physical play. It
went in our favor." The Bul
lets are no strangers to physi
cal play, so they handled
Hopkins gracefully.
The Bullets' defense did
a remarkable job keeping the
Blue Jays in their place, despite
the two breakdowns.

Sophomore Brett Kelly
played a solid game against
what he called a solid team.
His starting position is a con
siderable promotion from vid
eotaping the games. He has
been consistently keeping the
Bullets out of trouble along
with the rest of the defense,
which includes Andrew
Addonizio, Wes Thurmond,
James Miller, McLaughlin,
Kelly, and keeper Nick La
Porta. Gettysburg definitely

won the air gafl_^Band Kelly

finished 1 lth out of 31 teams,
an impressive showing indeed
when considering the compe
tition facing the Bullets.
The competition was
rough. Eight of the ten teams
who beat the Bullets were Di
vision II or above, and then
you consider perennial pow
erhouse Haverford, ranked
15th in the nation for Division
III, there were some good
teams there.
The women also fared
well, as sophomore Kristin
Roberts' 11th place finish (at
19:19.32) was followed by
junior Kim Heimerl in 76th
place (20:30.94), sophomores

Lauren Davis and Megan
McGolrick in 84th (20:35.33)
and 100th (20:49.61) place,
respectively, and junior Kelley
Lord in 108th place
(20:56.59).
This all added up to a
14th place finish out of 33
teams. The senior class women
of Meghan Anderton, _Chesjia
Miller and Jen Wise, were hon
ored with the Golden Cleat, _*s
they participated in their final
regular season meet.
A major concern for _thifi
women are the gaps existing in
their varsity squad, and accord
ing to senior co-captain Chesha
Miller, it is a concern which

needs to be addressed if the
Bullets wish to obtain their
post-season goals.
"We definitely have the
potential to put in a better
showing than we did last
week," she said. "Hopefully,
with some much needed sleep
and good training this week,
we will be able to rise to our
full potential on Saturday."

Women's soccer ready to net championship

by Kristin Robfri
s i"ah- writ! r

The winning spirit con
tinues to dwell in the members
of the women's soccer team.
Of the last nine games, the
Gettysburg women have won
eight, six of which were shut¬

. Last week the Bullets im
proved their overall record to
10-6-1. At 8-0, they are still
undefeated in the Centennial
Conference.
They are now ranked
tenth in the Mid-Atlantic re
gion. On Wednesday, the Bul
lets played host to the
Haverford Fords. This was a
low scoring game and captain
Lauren Frankford called it "a
hard fought win against a team
with some dangerous pieces."
The teams were well
matched, which is evident
when considering only eight
shots were recorded for both
teams combined, and Gettys
burg squeaked out a 1-0 vic
tory.

The single goal of the af
ternoon was scored by senior
Amy Brewster, less than two

minutes into the first half.
Sophomore Emily McAuhffe
crossed the ball, allowing
Brewster the opportunity to
put it past the Haverford
goalie.
The goal was the seventh
of the season for Brewster,
placing her

sixth in the
conference
for scoring.
Shots also
came from
senior Maureen
McBnen and
freshman
Julia
Girman, but
were stopped by
Ford defend
ers. The
Bullet de
fense was
sharp too.
Goalie Erin
Hayden had
two saves to
contribute to
the victory.

O n
Saturday, the

Junior Rachael Rzemiewski (8) battles for position last
week against Haverford.

Bullets were on contributing

the road for a contest with
Swarthmore's Garnet Tide.

The game against a team with
a record of 1-6 in the confer
ence was not particularly chal
lenging for Gettysburg. They
won 6-0.
Five different women
scored goals during the game,
with more offensive players

to the success

To start off the action, goal, assisted by sophomore
senior Patsy Cors fired in a shot Maureen O'Donnell.

off an assist by Brewster.
Brewster then provided an as
sist to McBnen for the next
goal of the game.
Following that goal,
McAuhffe found the back of
the net off an assist by sopho
moie Abi Reaser. McAuliffe

ing, posting

wasn't satisfied
with one goal,
so she shot and
scored again to
record the
fouith Bullet
goal of the day.
In the
second half,
Reaser took a
turn in scoring,
as well.
"Reaser
played very
well. It was
one of the
bright spots in
a game where
we didn't play
extremely well
as a team," said
Frankford.

Senior
Lauren Scott
finished off the
Bullets' scor
the team's sixth

Swarthmore s offense
was not strong. They took only
three shots. Goalies Amy
Campbell and Erin Hayden
each collected one save to hold
the Garntet Tide scoreless.
This week concludes
regular season play for the lady
soccer superstars. On Thurs
day, they take on a non-threat
ening Bryn Mawr squad, whose
conference record is 8-0.
Saturday will be a differ
ent story. In the last home
game of the season, the Bullets
will face the Western Marylafid
Green Terror. WMC has lost
to only one conference oppo
nent. They will present a tough
match for Gettysburg.
Frankford spoke for the whole
team when she said, "We are
primed for the challenge and
ready to defend our Centennial
Conference title."

In addition to being the
key and final game of the sea
son, Saturday is senior day. The
Lady Bullets deserve some ma
jor spectator support as they
attempt to qualify for the
NCAA tournament on their
home field.
They would greatly ap
preciate an enthusiastic cheer
ing section!

The winds of autumn
blew strongly on Saturday - a
not-so-gentle reminder that we
are heading into the final days
of this falls athletic season.
And as the breeze pushed
the sun across the sky, in and
out of the clouds, the Gettys
burg College Invitational took
place; Wind is not a great ele
ment to have present when run
ning a cross country race, es
pecially considering the fact
that both the men and women
who make up the Gettysburg
College cross country teams
were preparing for the upcom
ing Centennial Conference
Championships, to be held at
Gettysburg.

This great opportunity to
get a feel for the course with
considerable less pressure
could have served the Bullets
well. Unfortunately, Mother
Nature had a different plan, as
the blustery breath of God at
times wreaked havoc with the
intrepid harriers.
Despite the inclemency, it
was an aesthetically pleasing
day. A large crowd had as
sembled for parents weekend,
the campus lawns were freshly
shorn, and the brilliant fall fo
liage cascaded over the gently
sloping hills with ease, much
like the Gettysburg College
men's and women's cross coun
try teams.
The men were led by se
nior David Gary, whose time of
27:16.88 netted him the top

a 38th place finish overall.
Junior Jason Rose fol
lowed Gary with a time of
27:22.92, good for 46th place,
and sophomore Evan
Merkhofer's time of 27:31.38
not only gave him a 54th place
finish individually, but was also
a personal best. For that
achievement Merkhofer was
duly rewarded with the Golden
Cleat. When asked about his
performance, Merkhofer said:
"I had a bad race last year at
home and I was taught you
never lose at home, so it was
important to run well. I knew
the course, and I wanted to run
a good race and get a good time
so I could go into next week
on a high note."
As for the rest of the men,

strong fresh
man campaign,
finishing in
69th place with
a time of

Another week of ups and downs for the
Gettysburg field hockey squad

by usa beideman
Staff Writer
The past week has been
filled with bittersweet emotion
for the members of the '99
Gettysburg Field Hockey team.
On Saturday, the Bullets de
feated the 19th ranked team in
the national coaches poll.
This 2-1 win over the
Washington Shorewomen was
a huge Centennial Conference
victory for the squad. Ten min
utes into the first half, senior
forward Amy Stambaugh was
the first to find the cage for an
unassisted goal for the Bullets.
They pushed their lead to
two after another goal in the
first half by sophomore for
ward Aimee Bois off an assist
from senior captain Steph
Fisher. The score at halftime
stood at 2-0.

In the second half, the
Shorewomen were able to close
the gap by sneaking the ball
past goalie Maureen Giese, *
However, tight defense kept
Washington out of their scor
ing end for the remainder of
the game.
Gettysburg outshot
Washington 24-3 and had two
times as many penalty corners,

10-5. This win improved the
Bullets record to 16-1 on the
season and 7-0 in the confer
ence. On Saturday, seniors Lisa
Beideman, Tara Chipko, Laura
DeSario, Steph Fisher, and Amy
Stambaugh were honored for
their four years of
committment to the team. This
marked the final regular season
game of their career on Memo
rial Field.
On a more joyful note,
Head Coach Carol Cantele cel
ebrated her 100th career vic
tory on Saturday as well.
Cantele has become the third
coach in Gettysburg's history to
reach that milestone. She is
now second to her former
coach Lois Bowers for most

career .
On Tuesday, the Bullets
traveled to Baltimore to play
another Centennial Conference
team, the Johns Hopkins Blue
Jays. After a scoreless first half,
both teams returned to play in
the second half and only two
minutes in, Hopkins hit the
boards to lead the game 1-0.
The rest of the half was
scoreless until DeSario found
the cage off a direct hit from a
penalty corner with forty sec
onds left.

All-conference forward Jen White runs the hall up the field.

J unior defender Whitney
Walsh and Fisher were credited
with the assist. This goal tied

the game at 1-1 entering over
time. After two fifteen minute

scoreless overtime periods, the
contest went to penalty strokes.
In the first set of ten
strokers (five from each team),
Fisher scored only to be
matched by a Hopkins player.
In the second set, junior de
fender Megan Eddinger and
Fisher found the cage for the
Bullets, whose efforts were also
matched by the Blue Jays.
Finally, the game turned
to sudden death penalty strokes
in which the competition is
raised to a one to one stroke
off. In this case Hopkins had a
stroke and made it and the Bul
lets, despite courageous efforts,
were unable to answer their
call, ending the game 2-1.
This loss moves the Bul
lets to 16-2 overall and 7-1 in
the conference. Giese recorded
five saves on the afternoon and
held up the Bullets defense in
the cage.

Junior midfielder Tabitha
Gary had this comment to
make about the game, "We
played a long and well fought
game. I think everyone should
be commended for their effort.
I have a good feeling that we
will bounce back, beat

Volleyball overcomes last hurdles on way to NCAA bid

by Kristin Seaks
Staff Writer
Gettysburg's volleyball
team overcame one of the last
two hurdles in the way of ad
vancing to the NCAA Division
III tournament when they de
feated Johns Hopkins last
Wednesday, 3-0 (15-10,15-13,
16-14).
Sophomore Megan
Wargo said, "We were very fo
cused; we knew what we had
to do and we did it."
The Bullets played a solid
match, but the games were not
without points of uncertainty
and anxiety.
In game one, Gettysburg
played well offensively. How¬

ever, after losing the serve at
one point in the game, the Bul
lets also lost control of the
game. Johns Hopkins demon
strated a sudden burst of energy
and took a turn at determining
the pace of the game.
After a Gettysburg
timeout at 13-10, they returned
to get a sideout and junior
Nicole Evans served one of the
game's aces to push them one
point away from the end of the
game. Hopkins postponed the
hnal point with a sideout, but
when Gettysburg served again
the game ended with one of
junior Lisa Kamin's 13 kills ot
the match.
The Blue Jays entered the
second game with a high en¬

ergy level. Their energy along
with Gettysburg's mistakes al
lowed them to lead the game,
4-2. Senior Catherine Schott
then supplied a badly needed
kill to give Gettysburg the serve
back. Schott also had 13 kills
for the match.
The Bullets tied the score
at 4-4. Although the pace of
the game was quick, the score
moved very slowly until it was
tied again at 8-8. Both teams
were playing what is best de
scribed as "scrappy" volleyball
and showed great determina
tion m their playing.
However, with a 12-9
lead, the Bullets lost the serve
and Johns Hopkins closed the
gap with their eleventh point.

At this point, there was a
pause m the game as the Blue
Jays' coach Chris
Weidenborner was shown a

Paul Smith's historical performance keys Bullet win
Smith scores six touchdowns, sets seven records in front of capacity crowd

by Ronnie Beeman
Contributing Writer
For three and a half years now, we
have watched in amazement as Paul
Smith has rumbled the fields here at Get
tysburg College. He has broken records,

touchdowns to lead Gettysburg (2-5, 2
3 Centennial Conference) to a 42-28
upset victory over Muhlenberg (52, 4-2
CC) in Centennial Conference action on
Saturday.
"He was amazing today," said right
tackle Bill Beining, "I have been apart of
many games, and Paul just had one 11 of

tackles, his
own hel
mets; and
(when he
flexes his
muscles)

heart. B u t
on Satur
day, the to

Bullet team

to begin a
new season_.

Mules, 28
42. Behind a surging offensive line
Smith broke program records with 45
carries for 390 rushing yards and six

the best I have ever seen. As offensive
linemen, we just give him a little crease,
and he is gone. He is a Special player."
In addition, Smith unofficially set

College. He finished the day with 8,496
all-purpose yards, vaulting to second
place on the all-divisions list behind Em
pona (Kan.) State's Brian Shay (9,301).

keeps me going," says Smith modestly,
"I see how hard they work; I feed off
that." Well, humble pie it is again.
C'mon, Paul. For once, take a deep

an NCAA all-divisions record with 527
all-purpose yards, breaking the mark of
525 set by Andre Johnson of Division II
Ferris St. On September 16, 1989.
On the game's opening kickoff re
turn, Smith eclipsed the Division III ca¬

reer all-purpose yard record of 7,970 have sworn they were dating_,
yard held by Carey Bender of Coe (la.) Perhaps Paul deserves a shrine; a
m o n u -

Smith's 390-yard rushing perfor
mance was the fifth-highest total in Di
vision III history and the best in confer
ence history, breaking the mark of 347
rushing yards set by Chuck Wotkowicz
of Johns Hopkins in 1993.
In addition, he broke the Centen
nial Conference's record for career rush
ing touchdowns (45), finishing the day
with 47.
Overshadowed by Smith's historic
afternoon was the performance of a Get
tysburg defensive unit that held the high
octane Muhlenberg passing attack to 211
yards. Mule quarterback Michael
McCabe, who entered the game with a
conference-best 303.7 passing yards per
game, completed 15 of 25 passes for 174
yards and two touchdowns before leav
ing the game with an injury in the fourth
quarter.
Recording sacks for the "D-Line"
were senior Gene Kraus, and freshmen
John -"Mighty Joe" Young and Pete
Appel. The Bullets' secondary also came

up with blanket-like coverage, causing
the Mules quarterback to run on many
an occasion.
Second-year cornerback Matt Dia
mond was around Mules receiver
Kenyamo McFarland so often you would

mem h i s
honor;
after all,
he has
scored five
touch
downs twice
and scored six TD's
on Satur-

H o w -
ever, ac
cording
to Paul,
his team
deserves all the
credit. "It
is my
team f It ct t

breath and look at the stats. You are just
over 800 yards away from being the most
prolific person ever to carry the football.
More yards than Barry Sanders, J im
Brown, Emmit Smith, Earl Campbell—
take your pick.
Please Paul, for once admit that all
the hard work has paid off. All the lift
ing, all the running in the offseason, all
the mornings at 5:30 when that snooze
bar was so tempting.
For once admit you deserve it.
For all you fans out there who
haven't seen Paul, don't panic. This se
nior has one more show. One more time
to show everyone how a 5'9 kid from
Jersey made it.
Well, Paul you made it all right, all
the way to being one of the best backs to
ever touch the ball. So, come see Paul
break some tackles and some records
because he and his reborn team are
united,, and focused.
