Gettysburg's Greek system:
Going the way of the dinosaur?

By Nadine Hoffman
News Editor
"We will not go down without
fighting!" junior Robert Reese (FIJI) ex
claimed in the face of an Inter Fraternity
Committee (IFC) meeting held on Mon
day, November 1, to discuss imminent
transformations to
be enacted within

the system of
Greek life.
The agenda
of the IFC meeting
entailed the Col
1 e g e
administration's ar
gument for a
"smaller, stronger
Greek commu
nity." Under such a

iw

plan, first year stu
dents would be de
nied the opportu
nity to join frater
nities and sororities
altogether. No stu
dent would be able
to occupy a frater
nity house prior to
the fall semester of
his junior year.
This change in
policy would take

Will fraternities face extinction with the administration's proposed plan of
Sophomore Rush 7 Will the Greek system fall due to policy change?

effect with the Class of 2004.
Administrators suggest implement
ing such a change on the premise that
"first-year students make more unin
formed decisions than sophomore stu
dents, are more vulnerable to hazing" and
that the process causes "disruption of
initial social relationships and class iden
tity, negative effects on adjustment to
college life and college retention rates,
and an early negative impact on GPA,"
according to IFC minutes.
Many students, both Greek and
non-Greek, disagree with these assump
tions and feel that denying First Year
Rush will greatly harm and possibly con
tribute to the demise of the Greek sys
tem at Gettysburg College. Since 82 of
the men currently living in fraternity
houses are sophomores, this proposed
change could substantially reduce the
number of brothers residing within fra
ternities, consequently forcing senior

brothers to remain in their houses rather
than live in off-campus residences in or
der to keep them running.
The administration pointed out at
the meeting that of the 284 available beds
within fraternity housing, only 214 of
those beds are being occupied this semes
ter. It seems, therefore, that by limiting
the students who can pledge to the upper

_i<i?Ml«SStl»

^»<«_5i&§i£i

_nltl

classes, administrators would further re
duce the number ot men dwelling in Greek
housing. Theoretically, this move could
create higher dues and ultimately act as a
catalyst for the phasing out of the Greek
system.
Of this proposed motion to enforce
Sophomore Rush, one senior stated, "the
first step m weakening the system is to
move tush to sophomore year." A first year
student added, "they would be taking away
an entire year of being able to live in a
fraternity and for the women an entire year
of sisterhood."
During the IFC meeting, administra
tors cited drinking as a large component
of the fraternal social setting, singling out
Greek men and women as the chief viola
tors of Gettysburg's alcohol policies. Col
lege statistics show that "the GPA of non
Greek men has been steadily increasing in
the past 10 years and is on the average
higher than the GPA of Greek men." Also,

"The GPA of Greek women has been
lower (with the exception of one year) in
the past 10 years than the GPA of non
Greek women."
In addition, College data indicates
that "Greek men have double the aver
age number of drinks per week (19.45)
than non-Greek men (9.76)." For sorori
ties, evidence shows "Greek women have

a higher number of drinks
per week (9.99) than non
Greek women (5.92).
How can one say that
those students surveyed
provided 100 percent ac
curate information? It is
difficult to generalize that
one's status as a Greek or
an independent -deter
mines one's use of alco
hol. Regarding alcohol
and the Greek system, one
Phi Psi brother com
mented, "The Greek sys
tem benefits me far be
yond beer and parties." A
senior voiced his senti
ments, saying "As a
brother at FIJI, I have
learned that the Greek
system is definitely more
about responsibility, trust
and companionship than
alcohol. Anyone who dis
statement statement has never been

agiees with this
in a Greek institution."
It is important to note that the fo
cus of Gieek oiganizations is not solely
social; it also encompasses many aspects
of community outreach. Each fraternity
and sorority supports a philanthropy, for
which they organize events and fund rais
ers. In fact, Greeks are one of the largest
fund raising sources present within the
College community.
The notion of "abolishing the Greek
system," based on rumors which have
been circulating about campus all week,
has outraged a large portion of the stu
dent body, Greek and non-Greek. Says
one first year female, "If the Greek sys
tem is abolished, then I, as a first year stu
dent, would seriously consider transfer
ring to another school." Yet another mem
ber of the Class of 2003 protests, "With

belief that the timing and inform

change was insufficient and neg
ligent. The lack of communica
tion between those initiating this
change and the student body as
a whole led to confusion as to
when the actual voice mail sys

prepared for such a major

were being trained for its use,
students were left confused by

The College has proposed
Sophomore Rush standing on
grounds that this change will
produce "stronger leadership, re
duced liability, better retention
of seniors, and the re-engage
ment of alumni who may have

felt alienated." Some students
disagree. One IFC council mem
ber reminds us, however, that "If
we are able to provide our argu
ment and give a relevant alter
native, we will be able to get
much further than by aggres
sively confronting the adminis
tration." He advised, "In the past
couple of years the faculty had
been much more open and con
genial toward the Greek system,
but a 'call to arms' alienates any
support that we might be able to
gain from other constituencies in

If you would like to voice

Telephone tribulations: an update on voice mail

by Barb Dickson
Editor-in-Chief
For the past week, the
campus has talked of nothing
but the new voice mail system,
installed on Saturday, October
30. Due to some problems
during the installation of the
system, students have voiced
many concerns about voice
mail. Mike Martys, the Vice
Provost for Information Re
sources, emphasized that every
one involved in bringing the
new telephone system to cam
pus believed that there was a
desire from the campus com
munity for voice mail. For
years, parents and students
have been calling for a voice
mai] system.

In addition, the old
phone system was falling apart
and was not Y2K compliant.
The change had to be done be
fore the year 2000. The deci
sion was made to make the
switch at Reading Days, to beat
the rush at Thanksgiving and
Christmas. However, a part
was late in coming in from the
manufacturer, so installation
had to be postponed until this
past week.
The change to the new
phone system is what triggered

the new voice mail system.
Martys says the new sys
tem is "technically more so
phisticated," with many op
tions open to students, such as
the ability to set up message
lists and mailboxes for each in
dividual in a room.
The team working on the
transfer was so confident about
the students' desire for voice
mail that current students were
never consulted. "We thought
we were doing the righf thing,"
said Martys. "Our intent is
never to screw the students
over." "We know the transfer
didn't go as smoothly as we had
hoped, and we're very sorry,"
he continued.
As for the fee, which is
$50 a semester, the per minute
charge for use of long distance
is down while the semester

charge is up.
Right now, problems are
being handled as they come in
to the help desk (x4357). Eight
people are working.long hours
to get everyone's mailboxes up
and in use. If you have a prob
lem with voice mail or your
phone, let the voice-mail team
know as soon as possible. You
could also email
phoneheip@gettysburg.edu
with any problems. They check
their messages at least every
hour. Martys admitted that the
students were not as well in
formed as they should have
been about the change. The
fact that the information sent
was partially wrong (hence the
change in mailbox numbers)
did not help the situation ei
ther. The problem earlier this

week was a result of a sorting
problem, where people's cam
pus box numbers did not match
their mailbox numbers. Oth
erwise, only about ten people
on campus would have experi
enced problems.
Professors were provided
with training for the __ new sys
tem. Martys says that students
did not received training, be
cause "students are very accus
tomed to new technology. We
were counting on students to
easily pick up the new system."
The system is also easier for the
students, whose system is less
complicated than that of the
administration.
The role of voice mail in
academics is still to be settled.
The way the system works now,
a professor could send a voice
mail to an entire class. Profes
sors have to make that decision.

And possibly one day, email
and voicemail lists could be
linked.
Many students have
problems with the three minute
limit on their mailbox. This
limit, however, is not set in
stone. The three minutes does
not include the time taken up
by your messages and is based
on information gathered from
other colleges. Three minutes
is the average time given to stu
dents at other colleges that use
voice mail.
Martys summed up his
position by saying, "We wish
we could've done better; we're
simply trying to make life easier
for the students."
Again, if you have any
problems with your voice mail,
contact either
phonehelp@gettysburg.edu or
x4357 as soon as you can.

|_M_^_B Bill Morrissey plays a pe
¦ H culiar brand of New England
fl_^B blues, sprung from the backwa
¦_Hl ters of the Northeast—and New
¦Hi Hampshire in particular. Musi
H_^_l cally, Morrissey operates in the
HH_| "songster tradition" of Missis¬

sippi John Hurt and Mance Lipscomb
more so than in the harsh and haunted
Delta blues style of Son House or Rob
ert Johnson, but subtly he incorporates
elements of both styles.
While he has made his name
through the circuit of coffeehouses
around the country, his music stands
alone in the folk world for its detail,
clarity, and literary insight. His niche
as a singer and songwriter has been es
tablished through perseverance and
sheer strength of talent. And it has paid
off. His work has been widely ac
claimed and, with each new project,
Morrissey has won ever-increasing
numbers of fans.
A particularly strong following for
Morrissey has been established in liter
ary circles. Editor Gary Fisketjon dis
tributed Morrissey cassettes to his stable
of authors, including Richard Ford and
Robert Olmstead, the latter of whom
even wrote the singer/songwriter into
one of his novels. Morrissey's sharp
attention to nuance and detail is unpar¬

alleled in folk music. Ted
Drozdowski—one of Morrissey's many
press champions-declared in the Boston
Phoenix, ". . . He has a reporter's eye
for detail but an ability to get much
closer."
Novelist, friend and fishing buddy,
the late Tom Williams, expanded upon
that statement: "It's rare to see that kind
of sophistication in the writing, [his
characters] have that kind of intensity,
that immediacy of sympathy Carver has,
a real intensity of understanding. His
narrators are imperfect, but they're not
caricatures."
Morrissey got his big break play
ing at the Newport Folk Festival in
1985. With his visibility on the rise, he
recorded two albums for Philo Records,
Rounder's singer/songwriter sister label.
Morrissey's third album, Standing
Eight, was the breakthrough. Rolling

Acclaimed author to
speak in Junction

Compiled by Barb Dickson
Editor-in-Chief
On Thursday, November 4, short
story writer Susan Perabo will be read
ing in Junction at 8:00 p.m. The read
ing is sponsored by the Writing House
and The Gettysburg Review.
Perabo teaches creative writing at
Dickinson College. Her work has been
anthologized in Best American Short
Stories and New Stories from the South
and has appeared in Story, Glimmer
Train, and TnQuarterly,
Perabo was the first woman to

play NCAA baseball (playing second
base at Webster University in Missouri)
and appears in the Baseball Hall of Fame
in Cooperstown, New York.
An award-winning and highly ac
claimed new voice in fiction, Perabo
celebrates everyday deviance—and rev
els, through her characters, at the in
sidious force of reality to creep in and
conquer amibitions and dreams. Her
debut collection, Who I Was Supposed
to Be: Short Fictions (Simon <5cSchuster;
$20) offers eleven tales of quirky yet
all-too-famihar men and women bruised

by love, crippled by insecurity, and
yearning for change. At turns hilarious
and wrenching, these slices-of-life gone
askew capture assorted fathers, sons,
mothers, daughters, husbands, wives,
friends and "exes" grappling to come
to terms with their frequently surpris
ing ordinary existence and sadly unex
pected fate.
"I think the most bewildering,
thrilling, terrifying, devastating, and
defining moments in life are those mo
ments when we look around at the
people and things by which we are sur
rounded and say, K Oh my God, How

did I end up here?'" Perabo reflects. "All
the main characters in my stories ask
themselves this question in some form
or another. Some ask it in desperation,
some in contemplation."
With wry humor and a reverence
for the absurd, Who 1 Was Supposed to
Be brings to life diverse people marked
by a devastating condition: paralysis of
the heart. With a firm grasp of tortu
ous inner lives, Perabo illuminates the
dashed hopes of sundry haunting char
acters, including an ungracefully aging
actor facing the jolting facts of a dying
career, a dead marriage, and a sly octo¬

genarian father
who dabbles in

nate having to be distracted by
them buzzing around your
head while trying to study.
Annoyed
Dear Libby,
There are too many flies!
You need to add fly trap plants.
They would be a lovely addi
tion to the array of foliage in
this library. Thanks.
Bugged
Dear Annoyed and
Bugged—-

The flies are driving
Libby crazy too. She checked
with the College's resident en
tomologist, Professor McGlynn
in the Biology Department, for
an explanation. He said we've
got more flies than normal be
cause it has been very dry, and
dry conditions cause more flies
to hatch. Then the cold
weather drives them inside.
He said that they are ev
erywhere, not just the library
and he's right. Libby could
barely eat in the Bullet Hole for
all the buzzing around. There
are fly swatters at the circula
tion desk and you are welcome
to borrow one and take it with
you to your study table.
Dear Libby,

Can you please serve us
hungry students? Coffee is
great and we appreciate it, but
when you stay up late until the
morning hours, your stomach
gets empty. I recommend non
messy stuff like cookies, candy
bars, etc.
Mete Atamel
Dear Libby,
I study late into the night
and morning. I know the li
brary serves coffee to keep us

awake. I am also hungiy but
Servo isn't open. Can you guys
serve us some food? Thanks,
Hungry scholar
Dear Mete and Hungry,
Libby is sorry but food
and library materials don't mix.
We can't serve food, and un
fortunately we do not have
space to establish an eating area
in the library. We don't have
enough study space as it is for
all the students using the li
brary. Libby knows that stu
dents get hungry and suggests
that you lobby for an all night
place to eat and study on cam
pus that ISN'T the library. The
Student Senate is working on
this very issue right now and
you might want to talk with
Martel Neville, a first year
Senator, who is investigating
alternatives for late night study
and food.

Dear Libby,
Make doors going out
Penn Hall side of the building.
Looking for Shortcut
Dear Shorty,
Good suggestion! Libby
would love to make all the
doors both entrances and ex
its. The staff will consider this
as main floor renovations
progress. The downside is that
we will have to purchase addi
tional security gates, which are
not cheap. Thanks for the sug
gestion.
Dear Libby,
My interlibrary loan re
quest came back with a note on
it "need full citation." What is
a citation and why does the li
brary need this from me?
Clueless
Dear Clue,

You are not clueless. You
probably do know what a cita
tion is, but just don't know it
by that name. A citation is the
information you put in the bib¬

liography ot your paper and use
for footnotes. It is the identify
ing information about a book
or periodical article.
In the case of a book it is
the author, title, publisher and
date. For a periodical it is au
thor, title, name of periodical,
volume, pages and date. Libby
needs this information in order
to request books or articles
from another school.
Think of it as the "finger
print" of the information you
want—the unique identifier. If
we don't have an exact match,
we can't get another library to
look it up in their system and
send it to you.
Hearts to Peggy
McMaster from Facilities who
spends her days making sure
the library is clean and com
fortable and that everything is
in good repair .

Hearts to everyone who
is doing a great job of keeping
the silence on the upper floors
of the library. Serious students
have told Libby that they ap
preciate the noise-free environ
ment. Darts to the incredibly
infantile morons who inscribe
messages like Phi Psi Sucks on
the inside of the library eleva
tor. You rank up there with the
Neanderthals who think we
want to look at their Greek fra
ternity symbols inscribed in
inch-high letters every time we
step in the elevator. And then
there is Jack. Jack, what is your
problem? Your name is
scratched on the elevator door
every time we turn around.
Just knock it off. Twoyear olds
write on walls, not college stu
dents. Grow up already.

Do you have a sugges
tion? Send it to my campus
email lmussel. If you'ie tech
nologically impaired and pre
fer the old fashioned method,
write it on a piece of paper and
put it in the suggestion box on

from pressures and stress in
creases the amount of times
they vomit.
Bulimics need a sense of
security and constant remind
ers of positive opinions about
themselves from others. Good
opinions of others translate to
good opinions of themselves.
The idea of others thinking
highly of them creates satisfac
tion in them. Most importantly
they need to be loved and told
that very often.
Bulimics are obsessed
with thinness. They want to be
perfect and well liked. To
them, this means having little
or no visible body fat. They
judge themselves in compari
son to others. Their appear
ance is more important than
what is inside. They hide their
inner feelings for fear someone
will find out their secret. This
results in difficulty accepting
themselves and having un
healthy relationships.

The physical effects on
the body are very serious prob
lems. Malnutrition occurs
when essential nutrients are
missing from the body and re
sult in deterioration of health.
Gum disease, the loss of teeth,
erudition of teeth enamel, and
cavities all occur because stom
ach acids eat away teeth dur
ing vomiting. Chronic swell
ing in cheeks, and bleeding and
infection in the throat take
place in bulimics. Enlargement
of lymphnodes and salivary
glands happen to some
bulimics. Digestive problems
may occur as well. Bulimics
sometimes use laxatives, which
lead to intestinal problems.
Bleeding can appear in the rec
tum. Potassium depletion
cause heart, liver and kidney
dysfunction and can result in
cardiac arrest or death.

There are many recovery
methods for bulimia. Three
main steps have to be taken in
order for the bulimic to start
the path of recuperation: rec
ognize you have bulimia, ac
knowledge you have a health
problem, and want change.
Family and friends may also
comfort the bulimic. This is a
treatable condition and help is

Society as taught us to be
very conscious of our body
image. People are constantly
receiving messages from mass
media such as television, maga
zines, and music about what we
should look like. In these soci
etal views, men are perceived
as strong, tall and toned.
Women are stereotyped as
young, slim and attractive.
Today it is common for people
to focus their schedules around
workout programs.
As humans in society, due
to mass media, we deal with
pressure to create the perfect

body. People today develop an
imaginative picture of their
body. Many times this picture
does not resemble what our
true body image is, forcing us
to have distorted images. Our
body image influences our self
esteem. People who suffer
from having a poor body im
age are characterized by the
following problems: feeling
anxious or depressed, avoids
being with others, having poor
relationships, have poor health,
may abuse alcohol and may use
drugs. These characteristics
may develop into more serious
problems such as bulimia and

.
A bulimic consumes large
amounts of food then proceeds
to vomit or take laxatives for
prevention from gaining
weight. Bulimia is a combina
tion of being in and out of con
trol. They love it but hate it.
They feel ashamed and re
pulsed but compelled to repeat
it. Bulimics cannot control
their urge to binge. All
bulimics aren't the same, but
have some general similarities,
and appear to be healthy, happy
and successful. Bulimics would
describe themselves are never
good enough or overachievers.
They have a desire to be per
fect and it comes from their
poor self-image. They function
as if they are about to lose ev
erything. The whole world is
seen as black and white to
bulimics. This attitude towards
life is turned over to weight
control. The increasing relief

Anorexia is an eating dis
order where a person refuses to
eat and can starve themselves
to death. Excess exercise is
done in a longing for thinness.
The refusal to maintain the
healthy body weight for their
age and height are also factors
in this disease.
Some physical indicators
of anorexia are visible where
others are not. Dry, flaky,
rough skin is a condition where
there is a lack of nutrients in
the body. Cold extremities oc
cur from no protective layer of
fat. The growth of fine hair
occurs in anorexics. Purple nail
beds stem from poor circula
tion. In femakes, the menstrual
cycle stops after a certain
amount of time where not
enough nutrients are accessible
to the body. Some less visible
symptoms are the pancreas
shuts down, osteoporosis, heart
failure, and damage to body

continued from page 6
organs that can't be corrected.
The starvation to the body
causes physical and psychologi
cal change. Biological change
causes brain to function differ
ently. In the early stages of the
disease weight loss causes hap
piness and confidence. In the
progressive stages of the illness,
maintaining of thinness is the
main goal. Anorexics exercise
in excess and go beyond nor
mal physical conditions. The
anorexic becomes hyperactive
where the body becomes off
balance, irritated and sleeping
problems occur. Unusual eat
ing behaviors for instance,
chewing excessively and be
coming stuffed after a few bites
are more effects of the disease.
There is a fear of gaining
weight that is always on the
anorexic's mind.

Food is the controlling
issue. It gives an illusion of self
control. Anorexia allows the

person to control others by
regulating what they eat and
how much. They create a dis
turbance to others around
them. However, usually they
like to eat alone, which furthers
their weight loss. Anorexics
brainwash themselves into be
lieving their appearance is an
improvement. They make
statements like "I am perfectly
fine" and "I have never felt bet
ter and healthier."
Anorexia is a very serious
disorder that can cause lifelong
effects. The anorexic needs to
come to the realization that
they are too thin. Since this
disease is progressive, the hab
its and thinking patterns be
come fixed or permanent. If
the disease gets to a point be
yond control hospitalization
may be necessary. The recov
ery period may be up to five
years and the process can be
slow and painful.

Columnist's bitterness
leaves reader disheartened
Last week I was disheartened to
read a column in The Gettysburgian by
a so-called "columnist" who wishes to
share his great and infinite wisdom with
the peons who attend this college. It
pained me to read the shameless, self
absorbed clap-trap of an individual who
obviously has problems that extend well
beyond our College Community. The
author is apparently a bitter man who
is simply looking for an outlet to vent
his frustration. His complaints about

our community are petty, and in my
opinion, based on some deep-seated

President, senior class need
to rethink their choices
In lieu of the recent opinions ex
pressed on the senior class presidency
of Mike Graham, I believe that it is nec
essary to make further clarifications re
garding the October 28 letter in The
Gettysburgian. Last spring, Michael
Graham ran for the office of class presi
dent, fully aware that he was going to
study abroad in the fall.

College is a time for new academic
and personal experiences, in fact, the
majority of the senior class has studied
off-campus. But none have been asked
to fulfill an obligation as large as the
presidency of the class while being thou
sands of miles away.
To specifically address the letter
printed in the last issue of The Gettys
burgian, studying abroad is an academic
undertaking one chooses to make. The
job of president of the senior class is an
extra-curricular activity, and if one can
not complete the obligation of the ex
tra-curricular activity while fulfilling
one's academic commitments, then one
should not continue with the extra-cur
ricular activity. In life people have to

Consider This

The College's decision to begin reviewing Greek life has sparked
many fires of debate and comment across campus this week. By mov
ing Rush to sophomore year, the College hopes first-years will have
more time to concentrate on academics and getting settled into col
lege life during their first two semesters.
Although the administration's plan seems beneficial to students
this may be the beginning of a long-term plan to eliminate Greek life on
this campus. With several fraternities being closed down or moved

tysburg are, more often than not, also attracted to the social opportuni
ties afforded by a fraternity or sorority. There is nothing inherently wrong
with having a Greek system, but if the College wants to diminish the
importance of Greek life, it needs to focus more on what kind of people
come here, rather than what happens once they are already enrolled.

underground in the past few years, the Col
lege is already in a position to further reduce
the number of people in the Greek system. The
percentage of Greek students has declined by
20% in the past year; moving Rush to sopho
more year might cause this slide to continue.
It is entirely possible that the College is
sincerely attempting to reform Greek life in an
effort to provide a healthy social environment
for some Gettysburg students. Even at this
early stage however, a complete elimination
of the Greek system does not seem far-fetched.
A second component of this issue is cam
pus demographics. This is college where more
students are athletic than not, more students
drink than don't and more students are white
than of other ethnicities. These are all com
mon traits in fraternities and sororities across
the country.
If the College wants to create a non-Greek
campus, it will need to attract a different blend
of students to Gettysburg. Diversity is an openly
admitted problem here, as is student alcohol
consumption. The College may be trying to
reduce Greek influence on campus in an effort
to decrease the amount of students attracted

to Greek life.
Regardless of the reason for the change
in Greek policy, the College needs to recog
nize that the kind of students attracted to Get-

PINION

Student opinion must not be ignored

Do you remember...

Over the course of the
last week two major changes in
the lives of students have been
proposed or implemented. The
first is the introduction of the
voice mail system which left
students confused and largely
without the use of the phone
system for a weekend. This was
a major inconvenience and
caused significant controversy.
The second issue, the one I
choose to address, is the pro
posal served to the student
body through Senate and IFC/
Panhel Monday night. Within

rfii ' s Side ot _Cynicism
by la. isherwood
Social Critic

this proposal is the addition of
new buildings and facilities
which will have a positive ef
fect on our campus. However,
most of the debate focused on
the issue of Sophomore Rush
and the future of Greek life
here at Gettysburg. In neither
of these instances was the stu
dent body sufficiently con
sulted, and it can be argued that
our interests have been largely
neglected by an administration
and trustees who 1 seem even
more callused and reserved
than before.

It is not my aim to ad
dress the issue of Sophomore
Rush, nor is it my place to of
fer arguments for or against the
proposal as a whole. These

types of arguments, will be
fought at a later date. Separate
but still essential to the issue is
the presentation of the said
proposal and the fundamental
lack of proper communication
with the student body.
To present a major
issue without even asking
for student feedback and
approval is a slap in the
face of every one of us
who put forth the effort to
try and make Gettysburg
a better place.

After attending the Sen
ate meeting and through hours
of conversation with people on
all sides of the issue over the
last few days,it has become ap
parent that a major reason
there is so much panic and
paranoia is because students
feel under-represented. Indeed,
students have such misgivings
and such recent mistrust be
cause the proposal was pre
sented in a very definitive man
ner regardless of our opinions
on the specific contents.

This type of presentation
was not an open forum of de
bate over our lives (because this
affects all of us and not those
in Penn Hall) but rather it was
structured in a way which can

only put students on the defen
sive. People seem to be defend
ing a right to speak and express
that has been neglected and
taken away. If you take away
our input, more hostility will
erupt and the facts of the mat
ter will become distorted
within the passions of those
most affected. People feel
threatened and become aggres
sive when they are not prop
erly informed.
Personally, I am a bit dis
appointed that the trustees and
those who govern our lives
have asked for so little feedback
from students. Students are in
volved in all aspects of college

life, often working long hours
on end to help make Gettys liU0_MUUf ZlWUtlhlS
burg a better place for all: ad¬

ministrators, faculty and stu
dents alike. If the current issues
concerning Greek life, which
have been mandated, were
given to us for debate and for
feedback, then I think the situ
ation would be very different.
To take a major issue and
present it without even asking
for student feedback and ap
proval is a slap in the face of
every one of us who put forth
the effort to try and make Get
tysburg a better place. Contrary
to the popular rumor, I will
contend that we are not a
largely apathetic group. In ad
dition, we are not so drunk
with our own lethargy that we

will take any major change to
this College lying down. It is
imperative that a debate be
monitored and indeed _thatour
opinions concerning this cam
pus be taken into consider
ation. How can those who dic
tate policy from afar truly rep
resent our beliefs?
For many, this issue has
broken the trust between cer
tain administrators and the stu
dent body. Fundamentally,
open and honest communica
tion is necessary in any trust
bearing relationship. Gettys
burg will never mature as an
institution of higher learning if
we do not have open commu-

the Pachyderm's Pulpif
Sophomore Rush can only hurt the Greek system

by john dunlap
Political Columnist
This week the President
of the College, Gordon
Haaland, and the Dean of the
College, Julie Ramsey, came
before Student Senate and the
joint meeting of IFC and Panhel
to present a summary of the
Gettysburg College Board of
Trustees Statement on Residen
tial and Social Life. The docu
ment appears to be a well
thought out work that will
bring Gettysburg College some
needed change, but the pro
posal for Sophomore Rush pre
sented threatens a tradition
dating back to the nineteenth
century for this institution: the
Greek community itself.

Both President Haaland
and Dean Ramsey attempted to
persuade IFC and Panhel that
the instatement of Sophomore
Rush would enhance the first
year experience and strengthen
fraternities and sororities. I do
not understand how cutting off
one-third of the brothers of a
particular fraternity chapter
could enhance the chapter.
What it would do is fi
nancially bankrupt fraternities
who would no longer be able
to keep their chapter houses
open. With the implementa¬

tion of Sophomore Rush, stu
dents would not be able to
pledge Greek organizations
until the first semester of their
sophomore year and could not
move into fraternities until
their junior year. Without any
sophomores living in fraternity
houses, they could not afford
to stay open.
The President and Dean's
response was to point out that
currently there are 70 open
beds in fraternities, while their
are 67 fraternity seniors living

off campus. They claimed that
if those 67 seniors moved into
the houses under Sophomore
Rush, there would be no prob
lem. The problem with this
line of thinking is that they are
leaving out the 82 Sophomores
who currently live in fraterni
ties. Fraternities have enough
financial problems with 70
open beds, imagine 82 sopho
mores not living in the houses
along with three open beds af
ter the seniors return, leaving
85 open beds under Sopho
more Rush.

In actuality there would
be far more than 85 open beds
because under Sophomore
Rush less people would pledge.
By sophomore year, students
are settled and athletes are
committed to their sports
which would prevent them

from pledging in the fall of
sophomore year, leaving a huge
gap in pledging numbers. Out
of all the examples given by
President Haaland and Dean
Ramsey of other schools that
have gone to Sophomore Rush,
Dickinson College is the clos¬

our case.
At Dickinson the number
of fraternities has dropped dra
matically due to Sophomore
Rush. The Theta Chi chapter
at Dickinson in particular lost
its house due to low member
ship and is currently down to
nine brothers, though it was a
strong house before Sopho
more Rush. Here at Gettys
burg we would lose houses al
most immediately because of
the loans they have taken and
the current financial situation
of some of the chapters.
The administration
claims that they believe there
needs to be more experienced
leadership in the houses. Cur
rently six of the ten fraternity
presidents are seniors and all
but two members of the IFC
Executive Board are seniors.
Half of my fraternity's Execu
tive Board are seniors, and the
same is true of many of our
other fraternities.

Seniors are very busy; this
year I am faced with graduate
school decisions along with a

senior thesis and my work on
campus. I am certainly not
alone, as many of my col
leagues in the Greek commu
nity do that and much more,
especially if they play a sport.
Now, not only are seniors go
ing to have to do more within
their fraternities, but they will
never get the opportunity to
live off-campus, simply because
they went Greek.
The more fraternities we
lose, the less interest there is for
Greeks in general. Earlier this
decade we had seven sororities
and just three years ago there
were 12 fraternities. The loss

of each one has not strength
ened the others, it has weak
ened the system. If we lose fra
ternities, which will occur un
der this proposal, then it will
hurt the other houses and the
sororities as well. Financial
assistance has been promised to
help us through this transition
but what about down the road?
If a fraternity were to have one
bad year with rush then it
would be done. Earlier this
year the College needed us to
take in sophomores because of
their housing crunch and now
that they have new dorms than
we can suffer.

we have not received any form
of communication from the
president, whether it be to say
hello and let us know about his
studies in Denmark or to in
form us of ideas he has for class
functions next semester.
Personally, I knew that
Mike was going abroad this
fall, but the majority of the class
had no idea of this when he ran
for president. He did not
openly disclose this informa
tion to the people that would
need his support in the fall of
their senior year. Mike has
both the leadership as well as
the tenacity to be class presi
dent, but unfortunately, he

make choices; if someone has
too many responsibilities, they,
in the end, should step down
from one in order to be able to
fulfill the other more important
ones. This is not just a letter
questioning the rights of stu
dents studying abroad and the
priorities they choose to con
tinue with. It is also a letter
questioning the commitment of
the president to the senior class
as a,whole, The other three
officers are doing a terrific job
attempting to keep,class unity
as well as motivation in a se
mester that the senior class
needs the most leadership. Yet

does not have the communica
tion or the commitment this
semester.
This is neither a letter
commenting on the ability, nor
the character of Mike, as he is
qualified as well as a great all
around person. Nor am I ques
tioning his choices to expand
academically as well as person
ally, as going abroad is the ex
perience of a lifetime.
It is merely a letter ques
tioning the choice he made be
fore leaving for Denmark - was
it right for him to run for presi
dent knowing full well
hewould not be able to fulfill
these obligations overseas?

And was the class correct in
voting for someone that was
not going to be here for half of
his term, coincidentally per
haps the most important semes
ter in his classmates' lives? Yes,
the office of senior class presi
dent looks good on a resume,
but is this worth sacrificing the
leadership of the senior class in
part? I think that to fully as
sess the situation, everyone
must take a step back and re
view the choice they made last
year, and now wonder if that
choice was the correct one.

Voice mail

system is that we will be able to
leave a voice mail message for
our professors or peers instead
of spending possibly several
minutes typing an email. Come
on, how lazy have we gotten?
Is this system really needed?
This new system is very
confusing. Yes, I agree that
many new technological ad
vances are welcomed and
needed. But the new voice mail
system is very complicated. You
must dial several numbers, re
member several codes, and your
messages don't even get to be
saved if you ever need to hear
it again some other time.
The most absurd aspect

about this system is that it will
cost every student $50 a semes
ter. That is more than $10 for
each month that we are here in
school. How absurd is that? In
addition to nearly thirty thou
sand dollars that we already
pay, we will still have to shell
out more for this idiotic sys
tem? It is bad enough when you
have to pay absurd charges for
using our phones, when any
where else in the US, we can call
for much cheaper. For example,
I spent ONE TENTH of a
minute (that is SIX seconds) to
simply tell my mom to call me
back, and I was charged $2.10.
Come on, Mr. Kingston and
President Haaland: are these

the best possible fares you can
give your students?
What bothers me and
many of my peers that I have
spoken to about the voice mail
system is that a letter was never
sent to our parents, nor noth
ing was ever mentioned to us
before the system was installed.
What are we supposed to do,
simply suck it up, pretend that
this system is great, and pay
$100 a year for this unneces
sary new service? I am appalled
and disgusted that the school
never once asked our parents or
us about this system. I am sure
that I speak on behalf of many
when I ask that maybe next
time that the administration
takes a huge step like this one,
they would bother considering
what the students think. Who
reallyasked for this?

Women are not being taken
seriously in Washington

by Rachel Hanson
Columnist
Last week Senator Jesse
Helms (R-NC) had several fe
male members of Congress re
moved from a meeting of the
Foreign Relations Committee,
of which Helms is the chair,
after they presented him with
a letter signed by over 100
House members in support of
an international treaty against
sexual discrimination.
Helms has managed to
block a Senate vote on the
United Nations treaty to end all
forms of discrimination against
women since its introduction in
1979. One hundred and sixty
two nations have already rati
fied this treaty.

Representative Lynn
Woolsey (D-CA) led several
Congresswomen and female
staff members into a hearing
Helms was chairing, where he
told the women to "please act
like ladies," and then ordered
Capitol Police to escort them

. A study also released last
week found that reporters fo
cus more on the personal char
acteristics of female candidates
than those of males and give
more attention to men's views
on issues, which makes it diffi
cult for women's views to be
taken as seriously as men's.
The personality and ap
pearance of female candidates
also are described more fre
quently than men's, as is the
woman's age, marital status,

and number of children she
has. Women are also directly
quoted six percent less and
have their positions on public
policy issues such as education,
health care, and taxes high
lighted four percent less than
men do. These may seem to be
small differences, but accord
ing to Kathleen Paul Jamieson,
director of the Annenberg Pub
lic Policy Center of the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania, "in subtle
ways, it magnifies stereotypes
and makes it harder for the
woman to be taken seriously.

That means it is not an abso
lutely level playing field."
These events last week
show how seriously women are
NOT being taken in politics
and how much more difficult
it is for women to be elected
than men. Although women
constitute 52 percent of the
adult population in this coun
try, they only hold nine percent
of Senate seats, 12.9 percent of
the seats in the House of Rep
resentatives, and are only six
percent of all state Governors.
These statistics clearly show

that women are not getting the
representation that they should
be in government.
To fix this, the first thing
that needs to happen is for cur
rently elected women to be
taken more seriously. The most
recent of Senator Helms' antics
is a perfect example of how a
number of men treat women in
government. You can be sure
that if a group of men had ap
proached Helms with a treaty,
he would not have told them
to "please act like gentlemen"
and then had them escorted

away. The findings on the
media's coverage of female can
didates are especially troubling.
This skewed coverage reaches
a great percentage of Ameri
cans, and the message that con
veyed is that what a woman
looks like is still more impor
tant than what she does. It also
shows that women's personal
lives are taken more into con
sideration in elections than
those of men.
Women possess an ability
equal to that of men to be a suc
cessful leader in politics, but
many people still do not real
ize this and politics in this
country suffer greatly. Our
government will never be as
good as it truly can be until
more women are in govern
ment and they are treated as
equals and as being capable of
leading this country. Perhaps
we should all keep this in mind
as we begin to consider who we
will vote for in next year's elec
tions.

Injustice

- continued from page 11 -
new efforts to abolish Greek
life on campus. If you are not
aware of what has been hap
pening recently, the Board of
Trustees and President Haaland
are in the final stages of chang
ing the configuration of frater
nities and sororities.
Currently, students are
allowed to rush and pledge the
fraternity or sorority of their
choice in the second semester
of their first year. Tradition
ally, in fraternities, this allows
sophomores and juniors to live
in their fraternity house while
moving off-campus and living
in a house or apartment as se
niors. The proposed new rule
will make it so students will not
be able to rush and pledge un
til the first semester of their
secondyear.

This year will be the last
year that first-year students will
be able to pledge in their sec
ond semester. Next year there
will be no pledges. Finally, in
the fall of 2001, there will be
the first of the pledge classes
under the new regulations.
The repercussions of this
new regulation mean a slow
end to the Greek system. With
this regulation, the school is
taking yet another right away
from the students of Gettys
burg College. Senior students
that are in a fraternity will not
be allowed to live off campus,
they must live in their respec
tive house. This alone will
cause the debrothenzation of

agendas.
One of the most crucial
laws in our judicial system
states that you are innocent
until proven guilty in a court
of law. However, in our soci
ety at Gettysburg College, this
is not the case. Here, we go by
what is called the preponder
ance of guilt. This basically
means you are guilty until
proven innocent. If you have
been accused of a violation, you
must go before a committee.
Here, if 51% of the committee
believe you are guilty, and 49%
believe you are innocent, you
are guilty according to the
school's regulations, whereas in
a court of law, reasonable
doubt is enough to proclaim
someone innocent.

A more recent violation
of our rights is the new
voicemail service. This service
is provided, apparently for our
convenience, at a convenient
cost of fifty dollars per semes
ter. However, do you have a
choice whether or not you
want to use this service? Yes, if
you choose not to use this ser
vice you still have to pay the
fifty dollars per semester, but
at least the administration is
letting us make a decision for
ourselves. It all comes down
to the fact that our school, Get
tysburg College, is driven by
the almighty dollar.
Further support for this
claim has been provided by the
school in the last few days: the

several members of fraternities;
which is exactly what Haaland
and those on the Board of
Trustees appear to be "hoping
for. Those of you that are in
a fraternity or sorority, your
chapter will most likely be dead
in less than ten years; President
Haaland will make sure of it.
And those of you who are in
dependent and still socialize at
fraternity houses, you must re
alize the concern should be
campus wide. There will be
little or no social life at Gettys
burg College. More impor
tantly, the Greek life on cam
pus is a major contributor to
every group on campus. Instat
ing this new regulation for
pledging will not only destroy
the Greek life on campus, but
as a result, it will also destroy
Gettysburg College.

If you disagree with the
actions of our administrators
and President Haaland, make
yourselves heard. It is our re
sponsibility as students and
Greeks to speak out against the
actions of the school that are
compromising our rights as citi
zens of this country, and the
actions that are compromising
the well being of our respective
Greek organizations. We can
not sit back and watch as Presi
dent Haaland destroys our
school. Take action!

outshot Dickinson 26-1 and
held the edge in penalty corners

11-6. The 3-0 win over the Red
Devils clinched a share of the
Centennial Conference title for
Gettysburg with their turf foe
Johns Hopkins.
Also, this victory im
proved the Bullets, ranked no.
2 nationally, to 17-2 and 8-1
in the conference.
Because of a new Division
III ruling, which gives the con
ference winner an automatic

bid in the
NCAA tourna
ment, Gettys
burg and
Hopkins met
again on Satur
day at six p.m.
on the Blue
Jay's turf to
battle it out for
the NCAA
berth. T h e
scene was
similar for the
Bullets, but the
expectations
were higher
and the stakes
more grand.
Gettysburg

fans decked in

orange and
blue painted
the stadium
and banners of
motivation adorned the
arena. Hearts

The loss, which was
Gettysburg's second penalty
stroke loss to Hopkins this
week, eliminated them from
the NCAA automatic bid pro¬

cess. This rush of emotions
through tears of defeat and the
possibility of the end of a fan

turned to cheers and hugs for
the members of the field

ing loss last Wednesday to ri
val Franklin and Marshall (3
2). This was Gettysburg's last
conference match of the season
and ended the Bullets' streak of
50 consecutive conference
wins. The streak began in
1994. Even with the loss, the
Bullets gained a piece of the Tn
Championship of the Centen
nial Conference, which they

share with Franklin and
Marshall and Western Mary
land. "It was a tough match,
and F&M played well," said
senior captain Catherine
Schott."
Team members acknowl
edged that although Franklin
and Marshall may not be a bet
ter team, they made fewer mis
takes in this particular match.
"It could have gone either
way," said junior Nicole Evans.
The scores of the games
support her statement. The
Bullets lost the first game 14
16, but came back to win the

second game 15-8. Franklin
and Marshall took the third
game 8-15, and the Bullets an
swered thus once again with a
I 5-5 win in the fourth. Finally,
the Bullets fell to Franklin and
Marshall, 8-15.
Gettysburg's leaders for
the offense were Schott, junior
Lisa Kamin, and sophomore
Christina Giles. First-year
Lauren Boyd helped the team's
defense with 26 digs. Megan
Wargo, a sophomore, brought
up 19 digs and senior Jenna
McKinsey had 12.
The Bullets were playing
without junior Mary Guay, one

of their top defensive special
ists, so the team had to do some
readjusting.
Head coach Kim Kelly
said, "We needed some more
kills from our hitters.e We
needed some more digs from
our passers."
The Bullets have achieved
their goal of being conference
champions and moving on to
the NCAA playoffs. They re
alize that they need to move
past this match. The top team
from each conference advances
to play in the NCAA playoffs.

Staff Writer
Two senior captains put
out benchmark performances
Saturday against Franklin &
Marshall to gain the win for
Gettysburg. The Bullets were
victorious, with a score of 3-1,
bringing their conference
record to 7-0-J, and their over
all record to 14-1-2.
The defense started off
the scoring, with a goal by jun
ior Wes Thurmond, his second
of the season. Sophomore
Mike McLaughn passed the
ball from 20 yards out and Wes
launched a rocket from the left
side into the top corner. This
goal put the Bullets ahead five
minutes into the game.
McLaughhn then had a
goal of his own, assisted by se
nior Jason Vishio, in the 28th
minute. The ball came from a
quick restart by Vishio, which
McLaughhn headed into the
back of the net.

This assist was Vishio's
16th of the season, breaking
the record previously held by
Greg Stevcic (1997).
Vishio set a new confer
ence standard with his next as¬

sist, while at the same timu
helping senior Chris Piyor to
score his 50th career goal,
which he slipped in right be
fore the buzzer.
Pryor is just the fifth
player in conference history to
record 50 goals. Impressively,
Pryor's career has not yet

enough, as it just

widen the maigm.
The only Franklin &
Marshall goal came in the sec
ond half, m the 72nd minute.
Keeper Nick 1 a I'oita made a
valiant effoit and got a good
poition of the ball, but not

slipped past

him. _Gettysburg did not play
up to its kill potential, but the
Bullets came out on top none
theless. Senioi |esse Flynn at
tubuted this to the fact that
the) had just faced their biggest
_l nal thiee days eai hei.
"Hopkins was a big

_pholo by Sieve Spicer

game," he said. "It was an
emotional letdown after it was
over." The Bullets still had
enough adrenaline leftover to
pull them through, though.
Flynn called the Diplo
mats a scrappy team, and said
that the Bullets, "had a hard
time getting it going."
Gettysburg only had 6
more shots than F&M, bring
ing their total to 10. Often,
when a talented team plays an
mfenor one, they can be
bi ought down to the other
team's level before they settle
in. Despite the level of play,
the Bullets succeeded in break
ing records and setting new
standards. Just before the
game, Flynn was blessed with
a premonition and he told
Vishio, "If you think you can
do it, you can do it. You can
do it all day long." It seems he
saw it coming.
The Bullets also suffered
a casualty on Saturday, when
Freshman James Miller was
taken down in the box. He
went up for a header and the

Cross Country teams place in upper half at conference meet
Men finish fourth, women fifth as runners set personal records

by Jeff Cumpson
Staff Writer
This past Saturday Gettysburg
College played host to the Centennial
Conference Cross Country Champion
ships. In unseasonably warm condi
tions, the Gettysburg College men's
cross country team finished 4th, while
the women finished 5th.
Junior Jason Rose again led the
men, as his time of 26:48.56 was good
for 14th place. Senior David Gary ran
his second consecutive strong race, fin
ishing _' just behind Rose in 15th place,
with a time of 26:56.86.
Sophomore Evan Merkhofer also
ran well for the second time in two
¦weeks, as his time of 27:24.92 put him
in 24th place. Freshman Dan Campion
eschewed any talk of nerves, clocking
in at a cool 27:29.54, which placed him
27th.

Sophomore Devin Odom and se
nior Brian Holden rounded out the top
five for Gettysburg, as their near-iden
tical times-of 27:32.56 and 27:33.66
were good enough for 30th and 31st
place, respectively.
" With so many strong individual
performances, one would expect the
Bullets to be pleased as punch with their
4th place finish. Not so, says Gary, a
senior co-captain.
"Even though some of the guys
can point to strong times and places,
we're in this as a team and we wanted
to do better than fourth place. We've
got one more chance to make our hard
work come to fruition."
The last chance comes is the
NCAA Regional Championships to be
held next weekend at Fort Frederick
State Park in Big Pool, Maryland. The
top two finishers go on to the NCAA

National Championship meet in
Oshkosh, Wisconsin.
"That," Gary said, "is the goal."
The women will also travel to
Maryland next weekend, and they will
do so with a solid performance at con
ferences under their belts. Leading the
Bullets to their 5th place finish was,
once again, Kristin Roberts. The
sophomore's 5th place finish came at
19:17.76, improving on last year's 6th
place, 19:21.11 finish.
Freshman Melissa Hollmann
crossed the line next for Gettysburg,
finishing in 25th place with a time of
20:17.96. Junior Kim Heimerl was not

tar behind, coming

sophomores Megan

Lauren Davis com
pleted the top 5 for
the women, finish
ing 34th and 38th,
with times of
20:33.39 and
20:40.31, respec
tively. Much like the
men, the women
were concerned
with the team's per
formance, while
keeping an eye on
next weekend.
Speaking of
the Bullets' 5th
place finish and
their prospects for
the regional cham
pionship, Roberts

said "It was an im
provement, so we're
happy with it. We
still have a lot of
work to do, though,
as far as focusing on
a common goal."
"It's time for
our hard work to
pay off," said senior
co-captain Chesha
Miller.
The women
race at 11:00 a.m.
next weekend, and
the men go off at
noon.
