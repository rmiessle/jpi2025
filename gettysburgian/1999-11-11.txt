Presidential candidate to
speak at Gettysburg

By Jeff M. Brindle
Contributing Writer
At its October 16 conven
tion, the Socialist Party USA
nominated the ticket of David
McReynolds for president and
Mary Cal Holhs for vice-presi
dent. McReynolds was con
vinced to run again by a draft
movement originating in the
party's youth section, the
Young People's Socialist
League. The Socialist Party
USA, which has doubled m

membership in the last five
years, is hoping that its new
core of young members can
help revive a lagging movement
for jobs, peace and freedom.
While many members of
the party are young, each can
didate has the experience of a
presidential campaign under
his or her belt. Mary Cal Hollis,
a special education teacher in
Colorado and mother of a
young daughter, was the Social
ist presidential candidate in
1996. David McReynolds, a

long-time peace _activist and the
first openly gay person to
recieve a parry's presidential
nomination, was the Socialist
presidential candidate in 1980.
Together
they plan _^^
to wage a _^^^

campuses \
all across 1_^
the coun
try. David McReynolds will
be making his first campaign
stop here in Gettysburg on No
vember 17. McReynolds will be
interviewed on a special epi
sode of 'Voices of the Resis
tance!' on 91.1 FM WZBT
from 4-.00 p.m. till 5:00 p.m.

_^
and will give a public speech
later that evening at 7:00 p.m.
in CUB 230.
The key issues the Social
ist Party USA intends to focus,
on in 2000 are comprehensive
health care for all citizens; fun
damental reform of the. prison
system and the ending of poli
cies emphasizing imprisonment
for non-violent crimes; an im
mediate 50% cut in the US de
fense budget; and the concept
of a maximum wage four times
the minimum wage as a solu
tion to the ever widening gap
between rich and poor. Also,
the Socialist Party will focus on
the bedrock socialist principle
of collective ownership and
democratic control of the
economy, the 'means of pro
duction.'

The McReynolds cam
paign is not without contro
versy however. He has advo
cated the abolition of the Cen
tral Intelligence Agency, the
withdrawal of the United States
from alliances such as NATO
which he believe circumvent

and undermine the United Na
tJons, and the ending of all eco
nomic sanctions.

Hummingbird research topic
of Biology Seminar

From GCPR
Dr. Michele Dudash of
the University of Maryland's
biology department discussed
"Hummingbird, Natural Selec
tion and the Evolution of Flo
ral Design in Firepink" on
Wednesday in McCreary Hall.
Her talk was part of the 1999
fall "Biology in the Afternoon
Seminar Series" sponsored by
the College's biology depart
ment.

Dudash is an associate
professor of biology at the Uni
versity of Maryland and a plant
population biologist. She
teaches graduate level courses
in plant population biology,
evolutionary biology of plants
and a number of graduate semi
nar courses dealing with con
servation and restoration strat
egies. At Gettysburg, Dudash
disscussed a long-term research
project to examine the role of

pollinators as selective agents
in the evolution of flower mor
phology, and flowering time in
the hummingbird-pollinated
Firepink (Silene virginica).
Firepink is predominately pol
linated by the sole eastern
North American hummingbird,
the Ruby-throat. Her ongoing
research is based at the Univer
sity of Virginia's field station,
Mountain Lake Biological Sta
tion, located in the Allegheny
Mountains near Blacksburg,
Va.

Iraq
A new report from the
United Nations criticizes Iraq
for continuing human rights
abuses. The Baghdad govern
ment has yet to account for
the disappearance of 16,000
Kurds over a decade ago. In
addition, hundreds of Kuwaiti
prisoners captured during
Iraq's invasion of that coun
try are still being held. The
government is also limiting
freedom of expression and as
sembly, as well as allowing ex
traiudicial executions.

Indonesia
Seven weeks after the ar
rival of the international
peacekeeping force, there are
still delays in deploying U.N.
human rights investigators to
East Timor. A large part of the
problem is money; Indonesia

approves funding for such
U.N. operations. Already, ex

Meanwhile, Indonesian

of the resource-rich western
Indonesian province demon

The social norms of Gettysburg

Creatures —
Tne Gettysburgian

by Cara Masucci
Staff Writer
If you have taken a close look
around campus lately, you may have
noticed the Social Norms posters that
are up in residence halls, the CUB and
academic buildings. So what is the So
cial Norms campaign? The Social
Norms program's aim is to educate stu
dents on their perceptions about the
average Gettysburg College's student's
attitude towards alcohol and drugs. The
program has pointed out that many
times there is a big difference between
reality and perception about alcohol
and rugs on campus.
Differences in the student's per¬

ceptions about other's behavior and the
actual reality of that behavior is what
led the many parts of the College Life
office to bring the Social Norms cam
paign to the Gettysburg campus. "The
College saw that this program had great
success at other colleges and universi
ties, and this drew our initial interest,"
said Tom Mottola, Director of Judicial
Affairs and Community Relations. "The
key elements of the program that at
tracted us include: its basis in actual
research-based data about the way
Gettysburg College students use alco
hol and its focus on the positive, respon
sible choices that our students make
around alcohol."

When the initial interest in _^^
the Social Norms program was
sparked, the school invited lead
ing practitioner of the Social
Norms approach, Michael Haines,
to speak about the advantages of _^
the program. The idea that this ap-
proach was different from others
in that it highlighted positive be
havior rather then focusing on the /
negative aspects of behavior at
tracted others beside Mottola.
Harriet Marritz, Counselor and i
Drug Education Coordinator, also
found this approach enticing. "We
want to focus on positive results
because most students engage in
positive behavior. It's very reassur- ¦—
ing to find out that other students
are in the same company of the student
who decides to make responsible deci
sions," said Marricz.
The College started the campaign
last spring by handing out surveys in

many academic classes. Over 380 stu
dents completed the questionaire that
asked all sorts of questions about alco
hol and drug abuse. Once the surveys
were completed it was time to analyze
them. "This is something we started
building comprehensively last year -
Tom [Mottola] and I worked very
closely with Kathy Doherty and Janet
Riggs in the Psychology Department to
analyze the surveys," said Marritz.
Many interesting facts _
came out of the data. ^' _^^ ^^^
Students were _^^_pi^^
asked how often _k^** . ._

they believed _^ _fc^^ 1 *
that the typical 6
Gettysburg Col¬
lege Student used alcohol
and 85% replied that the av
erage student used alcohol
times per week or more. In

tuality, when students were asked_^_%_«_fcV
how many times per week they
used alcohol, 67% replied that they
used it one day per week or less. More
than 67% of students polled also dis
liked being interrupted in their resi
dence halls by people who are drunk.
"This shows a pretty big gap be
tween student perception and reality,"
said Mottola. "The Social Norms pro
gram is aimed at trying to close the gaps
by providing students accurate informa
tion abut their peers, and these gaps by
providing students accurate information

\ Of students polled,
85% thought students typically
drank 3 times a week or more.
67% said they drink one day a
week or less.

about their peers, and these kinds of
gaps between perception and reality in
dicate that the Social Norms program
has great potential to help educate StU-

It may seem easy to question the
reliability of these surveys, and many
students have already done so this year.
Both Marritz and Mottola point out
that the data is truly reliable. "We have
a good cross section of students who
took this survey. Students also filled it
out anonymously so there was no pres
sure to answer a question a certain way,"
said Marritz. Other schools like
Gettysburg have also found the surveys
to be reliable over a prolonged num
ber of years better proving their
\ _^ reliability.
_jf^^ 1 _^^^ Once the re¬

sults were
in, it
_k. w a _s

iDLr—^ ;: r
BBljmjr cide how
Brill to reach the
\
_jj0_r campus. Many differ¬
ent parts of the campus com
munity had to help with this end of the
program. "Throughout the 1998-1999
academic year and through the summer,
we worked with students, faculty mem
bers, and administrators to determine
the best ways to communicate data to
students," said Mottola. Numerous fo
cus groups worked on what kinds of
messages and images should be on the
posters and where the posters should
be hung. Step One Design, a local de
sign firm, worked closely with the

school over the summer to produce
posters and other material to attract the
students' attention. Aside from integrat
ing posters into academic buildings and
other highly trafficked areas, there was

also much more the school decided to
do with the data. Groups like Cheers,
Gender Benders, and BASH have tried
to promote Social Norms on campus
and encourage the responsible behav
ior that so many students are exhibit
ing. All of the publicity has worked -
more then 75% of the students polled
on campus have seen the Social Norms
posters.
While this is fantastic news to the
campus community, what do you do if
you or someone else you know has a
problem with alcohol? "Many students
get confused by thinking that hiding a
friend's drinking habits is helping when
it may in fact be hindering them," said
Marritz. Sometimes the best thing you
can do is get them to a person that can
help them examine their habits. Marritz
pointed out that many students who
come and talk to her will decrease their

drinking because a friend was con
cerned about them. "There is a power
in helping friends," said Marritz. An
other misconception about alcohol use
on campus is that if you go to talk to
someone about either your own or
someone else's drinking that it will not
be confidential. Marritz pointed out
that all appointments all confidential
and that students do not have to release
names of other students.
Marritz meets with students to try
to educate them on their behavior as
part of a comprehensive prevention
_^^^^ program. "The Social Norms
program ranges from the ads,
to the education of students,
to behavior," said Marritz.
That is why so many organi
zations and sections of campus
J have become involved in the
Social Norms campaign.

Overall the Social
Norms approach combined
with the ongoing campaign to
educate students on issues con
cerning alcohol has been a tre
mendous success so far. "The
feedback we have received this
semester has been overwhelm
ing," said Mottola. "This [in
I formation] has helped gener
ate some good discussions on
campus, and I think the campus is be
coming increasingly aware of some of
the positive, responsible choices that

Library BULLETin
Plugged in, ticked off

BY LIB BY MUSS ELM AN
Dear Libby:
I persuaded my parents
to buy me a new laptop so that
I can avoid the overcrowded
labs on campus, but now I need
to get on the network! I've
tried plugging my laptop into
the jacks in the library, and it
doesn't work. What's the point
in having jacks if I can't use
them? Is it just me? Am I alone
in having problems here?
Very Frustrated
Dear Frustrated:

• A new laptop? Lucky
» you! Libby wrote about this
• same issue in an earlier column
entitled "Green Dot Special"
• but that was before she had so
, many loyal fans who read her
1 column. So here goes again.
, To begin with, Libby has
_• been getting many questions
t about using laptops in the li
• brary. You are not alone. In
• fact, you're never truly alone,
J but
• that's an issue for another
• rnlumn.

As for laptops, the help
ful people in Information Re
sources tell Libby that any
jacks, or ports with green dots,
that you see in the library are
working. They have tested
them all. You should be able
to plug your laptop into a
port, start the machine, and be
on the network.
IR says that they've been
getting calls about the ports
not working, and usually it's
the case of people plugging in
their laptops with the laptop

already running. Sorry. It
won't work if the laptop is on,
or in sleep mode. You have
completely reboot it after it's
been connected.
One more thing: if you
want to print, or get to your
files on the network, you need
to have a network client in
stalled on your laptop. It may
sound scary, but it won't hurt
a bit. Just give the computing
assistants in the Drop-In
Clinic a call at x6935, and
they'll get you the software.
Libby would like to
thank Martha, Bill and the en¬

tire Response Team for help
with this one!
Dear Libby,
I recently took a number
of books out of the library
which I need for a history pa
per. I made a point of going to
the library and getting my re
search done early so I wouldn't
have to worry about not find
ing the books I need.
A few days ago I got an
email from the library saying
that I had to return one of the
books on the 12th of Novem
ber so I called the circulation
desk to tell them that they made
a mistake and that none of my
books are due back until the
23rd. The reply I got was that
another patron had requested
the book and I was to return it
on the 12th so they could use it.
If I had a problem with this then
the library could put it on re
serve so that neither of us couid
take it out.

As it turned out the girl
who needs the book is in the
same history class and we can
figure out how to share the book
without making things more dif
ficult by putting it on reserve.
However I was unaware
of this policy, which in my opin
ion is unfair and fails to solve
the problem. Getting books out
of the library is fair game, or else
what would be the point of
checking out books in the first
place? It isn't my fault if some
one left it until the last minute
and I took the book they wanted
first. Why should I be inconve
nienced or held responsible for
the situation?
It's the library's responsi
bility to order another copy of
it if they want to help out the
other student. If this ever hap
pens to me again I can guaran
tee you the book will not be re
turned until the day stamped in
the back cover. It's just a mat
ter of principle.

Anita Christophides
Dear Anita,
Libby congratulates you
for having the good sense to
come to the library early and
start your research. If only more
students would do that, instead
of waiting until the bitter end.
We certainly understand your

annoyance when you are asked
to return one of the books be
fore the due date.
But sharing is part of Col
lege life, and we have to ask
you to be mature and share.
The library can not afford to
purchase multiple copies of
everything, and even if we
could, we wouldn't have
enough shelves to store all the
twins and triplets. If we got
doubles of everything we
thought someone MIGHT use,
our book budget would be
gone in a flash.

Instead we try to make
each book available to as many
people as we can by providing
realistic due dates and recalls.
On occasion one person will
have a book that another needs.
To be fair to all, we recall the
book and revise the due date—
but not until after you've had
it for a full two weeks. Two
weeks is enough time to get
through a book in most cases,
and you can turn around and
place a recall and hold on the
book and get it back again in
two weeks.

Luckily for you, the per
son who recalled your book is
in your class, so you can share.
This is often the case with re
calls, and Libby is thrilled when
this happens.
But how do you find out
if the person is in your class?
How do you know who has the
book you want?
Well, it's against the law
for Libby or anyone else in the
library, including your friends
working at the circulation desk,
to tell you who has a book that
you need, or who recalled the
book you are using. But if you
give us YOUR permission, we
will tell the person who re
called the book YOUR name so
that they can contact you about
sharing.

All circulation policies
are on the library webpage, and
this one can be found by select
ing Library Information and
then clicking on Circulation.
The first link is called "How
Do I Check Out Books" and it
is all there. We don't keep our
policies a secret.
In your letter you ask:
"Getting books out of the li¬

brary is fair game, or else
what would be the point of
checking out books in the first
place?" Libby would like to
respond to this. The point of
checking out books is so that
we have a record who has
them and when they are due
back. It is to keep track of
the collection. Checking out
a book through the online
system, lets others know that
the College owns the book
and that someone is using it.
Libby wants books to be
checked out. She'd rather
NOT put every single book
in the library on 2 hour re
serve, on the off chance that
two people might want to use
it at the same time. You use
the term "fair game", but
please remember, that this li
brary supports the curriculum
for the entire campus and you
may not be the only person
who needs that particular
book at that time. Someone

in another class altogether, _«
whose assignment isn't due •
until weeks after yours, may •
be the person recalling the •
book. •
So it might not be some "
lazy, no good sot in your class •
who has waited until the end. •
It could be someone in an- •
other class who is just as mo- *
tivated and energetic as you •
are. Try to have a little per- *
spective. While you see the •
book being recalled as an in- _J
convenience, the other per- •
son may see it as the "only" *

book on the topic. •
Libby asks you to try J
and put yourself in the other •
person's shoes. What if the J
student in your class got to •
the book first and you really _J
needed it. Wouldn't you be •
happy to know that you could _,
recall the book and get it •
within a couple of weeks? a
Wouldn't you be happy that •
the library staff was willing to a
make arrangements for the •
two of you to share? Smart, •
eager, hard-working students •
who plan ahead are not be- •

Finally, Libby frowns on
threats like the one in your
closing remarks. Failure to re
turn a book when recalled will
cause your fines to accrue. Let
the library staff work with you
to share the materials we have
instead of being mad.
Tip from Libby: There

culation desk, available for

are seriously bugged.
Request from Libby:
Please stop eating and drinking
in the newly renovated Harner
Room on the third floor of the
library. If the food and liquid
consumption do not stop, the
room will have to be locked.

Hearts to the Reference
Librarians who have conducted
more than 100 one-on-one re

far this semester, and offered
individualized, in depth help

to students who were really

tion. Hearts to Susan Roach
and Linda Isenberger in Inter

find even the most obscure
materials that no one else can
find, and borrow them from
other schools for the students
and faculty at Gettysburg Col
lege. Darts to the smokers who
left their butts in the library
(and hearts to the students who
reported the smoking). Did
you just happen to miss the fact
somewhere along the line that
books are highly flammable,
and normal people don't
smoke near flammable sub
stances? Wake up pal. Smoke
on the front porch or quit al
together. You might live
longer. Smoking is not permit
ted anywhere in the building,
ever, and if we find you, and
not just your disgusting butts

you'll be having a date with the
Gettysburg police.
One hundred Darts to
the obviously strong, but intel
lectually limited, individuals
who removed chairs from the
front porch of the library over
the weekend.
Libby wants to mention
that Library director, Robin
Wagner, went out on a limb to
convince the powers-that-be
that chairs and. tables on the
front porch of the library were
a good idea, and they would
not be stolen. Don't make her
regret her efforts. If outdoor
furniture continues to grow
legs and walk it could end up
in storage permanently. If you
see the porch furniture making
its way off the front porch
please alert Security.

Libby will take mail,
signed or anonymous, at the
email address lmussel or in the
suggestion box on the circula
tion desk.

With exams, papers,

ing stress levels and anxiety
may once again be on the rise.
When one is overwhelmed
with all of life's challenges, the
person may be at risk for the
"common cold of mental
health problems"—depression.
Depression is a prolonged or
lingering sadness, which occurs
for longer than two weeks. It

is a sadness that never returns
to gladness.
The typical Gettysburg
College student may be at risk
for depression. More than 5%
of Americans, 15 million
people, suffer clinical depres
sion at any given time. Another
5% experience mild symptoms
of clinical depression and at

Better than fast food

by Kevin Mills and
Nancy Mills
TMS Campus
Serves: 4
Preparation Time: 5 min
utes (extra for toppings) (plus
lighting the barbecue or pre
heating the grill)
Cooking Time: 8-12 min
utes Rating: Very Easy
My first experience mak
ing hamburgers was in my sum
mer job at Jack-InThe-Box. It
was back when the minimum
wage was $3.35 an hour (I

sound like my parents—and I
actually did have to ride my
bike uphill both ways to get
there).
I was fifteen and the jokes
my friends made about the
pants I had to wear really stung.
But working there had its
perks. After midnight (a slow
point in the fast food business,
the only patrons being drunks
and people who want to rob
you), my superior (in job-title
only) would usually disappear
into the back to steal pickle
slices. I was thus free to cook
myself a burger.

Although I had not been
trained on the grill (my unique
skills being better employed
sticking tacos in a cauldron of
hot fat), I would create for
myself an unsanctioned triple
decker with everything. Even
though it was half pink, half
freezer-burned, it tasted great
because it was a forbidden
burger.
The first lesson I learned
about making hamburgers at
home is that they will shrink.
All ground beef looks the same.
But the higher the fat content,
the more it will shrivel. My
first crop of grilled burgers
looked like the ones in the
"Where's the Beef" commer
cials: very big, fluffy buns, but
the hamburgers were smaller
than the tomato slices. So next
time I made them twice as big,
and I bought smaller buns.

Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
(see Mom Tip)
Dash salt

Dash black pepper
4 hamburger buns
Optional Hamburger
Toppings:
4 slices cheddar or jack
cheese (for cheeseburgers)
Lettuce leaves
Sliced tomatoes
Sliced red onions
Sliced pickles
Ketchup
Mayonnaise
Mustard Relish Instructions:
Divide the ground beef
into 4 equal portions and shape
each into a large round patty
about 4 inches across and 1
inch thick. Sprinkle both sides
with salt and black pepper and
set aside.
Slice the buns. Prepare
and set out the toppings. If
you're making cheeseburgers,
have the cheese standing by
near the grill.

Prepare the barbecue or
preheat the broiling unit.
When the coals are ready, place
the hamburgers on the barbe
cue grill rack or in the broiler
pan and grill for 4 to 6 min
utes per side, depending on
whether you want them rare or
well-done.
For cheeseburgers on the
barbecue, place the cheese on
the hamburger once you've
turned it over. The heat of the
hamburger itself should cause
the cheese to melt. If it doesn't
and your barbecue has a lid,
put the lid on for about 1
minute, or until the cheese
melts. For cheeseburgers in the
oven, place the cheese on the
cooked hamburger and slide it
under the broiling unit for
about 30 seconds.
Serve on buns and pass
the toppings.

Mom Tip: The leanest
ground beef (7 percent fat) is
not the best choice for grilled
hamburgers because the end
result will be dry. The fattiest
ground beef (30 percent fat) is
not a good choice for differ
ent reasons: the hamburgers
will shrink by about 1/3, mak
ing them much smaller than
you expected, plus all that fat

will drip onto the charcoal and
flame up, leaving you with very
charred hamburgers.
For this recipe, I prefer
ground beef with either 15 per
cent or 22 percent fat.
Mom Warning 1: Turn
the hamburgers with a metal
spatula rather than a fork so
that you won't puncture the
hamburger and let the meat

juices drip out. Don't press
down on them with the spatula
while they're cooking since that
might force juices out.
Mom Warning 2: Don't
put cooked hamburgers on the
same dish you carried the raw
ones on to the grill. You could
transfer bacteria to the cooked
food. Kevin Mills & Nancy

Opinion

Students are unnecessarily
fixed on one aspect of
trustees' statement
We are writing as members of
the _Residential and Social
Life Advisory Committee, a
group of students, faculty, administra
tors, and trustees commissioned by the
Board of Trustees in 1998 to articulate
a vision for the residential and social
system here at Gettysburg and to rec
ommend programming, policies, and
facilities that would help to further that
vision.
Given the task at hand, this com
mittee was one of the best-balanced
groups that we have ever worked with
on this campus. Of the thirteen com
mittee members, four were students,
three were faculty, three were adminis
trators, and three were trustees. Ten of
the thirteen were current students or
alumni, and seven of those ten were
Greek. - continued on page 14 -
see STATEMENT

Clarifying voice mail
T he Opinion section in last week's
Gettysburgian included some
commentary on voice mail and
related issues which warrants clarifica
tion. Information Resources genuinely
regrets the difficulties the new voice
mail system has caused students. We did
not do as good a job on this installation
as we would have liked.
We agree that we could have done
a better job announcing the new voice
mail system, sending out more notices,
and sending them earlier in the process.
However, it is not correct to say
that the change was done without any
warning at all, or that the College did
not notify parents or students. In addi
tion to the several email messages and
student digest messages sent the week
prior to the cutover, the College sent
to both new and returning students a

letter explaining the scheduled change
in telephone service. The College also
revised the Student Handbook to reflect
the new system. In these documents the
issue concerning the continued use of
student answering machines was care
fully addressed. These documents ad
vised students and parents that after
voice mail was activated, students
would not be able to utilize answering
machines. And each letter cautioned
students not to invest money in expen
sive new answering machines for the fall

.
Many students have asked why
the voice mail/phone switch upgrade
took place during the semester. We did

see VOICE MAIL
New residential policies
need more thought
I just spent the past hour sitting
through a meeting of all Residence
Life staff members, professional
staff members, and Dean Julie Ramsey
concerning the forthcoming restructur
ing of social/residential life at Gettys
burg College, and I must ask, for what
reason ?
I was informed that the meeting
would be a forum where staff members
would be debriefed about the changes
which will inevitably restructure our
way of life here as students; but also
would provide Residence Life the
chance to ask questions, voice concerns,
and perhaps even gain insight into how
these changes would be beneficial to the
campus. As the song goes, I guess two
out of three ain't bad.

The Residence Life staff listened
to the explanation by Dean Ramsey as
to why these changes will occur and the
thought process behind restructuring.
The staff members were also given open
forum to ask questions and voice con
cerns about the impending changes.
- continued on page 12 -
see POLICIES

Consider This....

Recently there has been an outpouring of sentiment concerning
changes the College is instating seemingly without consulting students
Seniors: does anyone remember the surveys about social and residential
life on campus we filled out freshman year? How about the focus and
discussion groups that met to establish student opinion on the quality of
life and how it could be improved? Anyone recall those outlandish pro
posals to construct housing for upperclassmen near the West Building?
To maximize the space in the CUB and build a new recreation facility that
would be more open and inviting than the basement of Plank? Do you

attention when the College asks for your opinion on things: though you
may not personally benefit from the changes that may result, they are not
idle questions. And stop whining that the College did not ask for student
input on the items discussed in the latest mission statement; your per
sonal opinion may not have been solicited, but those of many other stu
dents who were once names and faces were carefully considered.

remember how we debated whether it was space
for athletic activities, student based social activi
ties, or professor student interaction that was
needed?
In case no one has noticed, many of these
proposals have been or are being carried out.
In addition, these suggestions and so much more
were put to students to examine, discuss, ac
cept and reject. The more than three quarters of
you who are not seniors and did not take part in
these discussions may be formulating contrary
thoughts right now, but let us remind you of some
thing: we are all temporary parts of this commu
nity. Gettysburg College may, and does have a
policy of doing things for the students, but that
does not denote a particular set of students. The
upperclassmen who put in long hours three years
ago to compile student opinion on future changes
have long since graduated, but they still took part
in the decision making process.

Academic life is like that. Typically, we are
each here for four short years, while faculty, ad
ministrators and support staff devote significant
portions of their lives to the College. Drawing up
plans for major changes and appropriating funds
to carry them out often takes much longer than
the span of undergraduate education.
Students need to remember that life at Get
tysburg goes on when they leave, and that in
their place will grow a new crop of students who
will benefit from things they worked for. So pay

New bill to help deadbeat dads doesn t do much
for single moms

by Rachel Hanson
Columnist
This week the House of
Representatives will consider
the Father's Court Act of 1999.
The bill, introduced last month
by Rep. Nancy Johnson (R
CT), will "provide for grants
for projects designed to pro
mote responsible father- _^^

hood, and for other
purposes."
If passed, this
bill will bring $230 J
million to men's cus- I
tody groups and 1
right-wing religious I
groups. The money J
will be used to r
counsel poor fa- _^-
thers and for job
training services for
these men. It would
also fund programs
to promote marriage
as a solution to pov
erty. Many people
feel that fathers who

do not pay support are being
wrongfully called "deadbeat
dads." Many of these men are
broke and in a great amount of
debt. The director of one
agency that is currently help
ing divorced fathers find well
paying jobs says, "the financial
aspect of this [paying support
for their children] is not going
to be easy for some of these
young fathers."
I think one very impor
tant group of people that are
not being mentioned in all of
this is the millions of women
who have been forced to be the
sole supporters of their chil
dren because the fathers are
unable to make payments.
These women deal with their
children's poverty on a daily
and much more personal basis
than men.

If he does not want to, or
if a father does not have
enough money to support his
children, he simply will not
send a check. However, a

mother does not have this op
tion: she can't simply not put
food on the table or clothes on
her children's backs. She also
has to see the sadness in her
children's eyes and feel her
own guilt if she can not buy a
toy her child wants or not send

her child on a school trip be
cause of lack of money.
One man, who is cur
rently in a program to help
him find a job so he can
k send support for his two
L young children, is wor
^^ rie d about how he is
_^^_k going to be

\ If H "e
\I noted
]// that at
^¦M least 25
percent
of his income would have to go
toward child support.

What this man and many
people fail to realize is that the
mother of his children has thus
been forced to support herself
and two dependents on her sole
income without the option of
saying, " I can't do it this
month." I think it is also very
important to remember that
she is likely to be making far
less than he does, because on
average, women make 25 per
cent less than men.
Another issue that has
been brought up in this debate_,
is that there are three million
families on welfare and there
are about one million fathers of
welfare children. It has been
noted that the majority of these
fathers are black and Hispanic
with low income and education
levels, which limit them in what
jobs they can hold.
Perhaps rather than
pumping all this federal money
into programs which coddle

fathers who claim they cannot
make payments, the money
should be redirected to educa
tional and social programs that
would help these minority
groups. If this were done, the
majority of the fathers of chil
dren in poverty would be able
to get better paying jobs, and
that would lead to an improve
ment in the regularity of child
support payments.

What did not occur was the
attainment of knowledge as to
how these changes are going to
be beneficial to us. Let me ex
plain ...
Dean Ramsey explained
the year and a half of research,
surveys, and analysis that
prompted these proposed
changes. Faculty, students, and
trustees were all involved in sit
ting down and working out the
new "mission statement" of
Gettysburg College.
I listened as Dean Ramsey
went on about the importance
of the first year experience and
the proposed plans for bring
ing students together (via the
new rec center) and breaking
down the barriers between stu
dent and faculty life. The aim
of the College is to make your
four years here as enjoyable
and student-oriented as is pos
sible-the ultimate residential
college experience.

I also listened as peers
and fellow staff members went
on to voice countless concerns
and questions about these
changes-arguing the effects
they will have on Greek life,
housing conditions, alcohol,
and the interaction between
students and faculty.
One of the key points in
Dean Ramsey's argument
caught my attention at the start
of our meeting-a point which
at first caused me to support
these changes, and later to be
more in support of the IFC,
Panhel, and countless other

Finally, it is extremely
important to realize that pro
moting marriage in these pro
grams is very dangerous.
Rather than making men re
sponsible for their children, it
makes women dependent on
men. This type of situation
would also invariably lead to an
increase in domestic violence,
the negative effects of which go
without saying.

Policies
- continued from page 11 -
causes than an 'independent'
normally would be. Ms.
Ramsey stated that in the ini
tial meetings of the committee,
issues around sophomores and
housing were examined. It was
asked why students who were
not "permitted" to live off cam
pus (sophomores) were given
the opportunity to live in fra
ternity houses, and in essence,
"fight the system." I thought
this a valid argument-it isn't fair
that those students who choose
to remain independent are
forced to live in the residential
college setting while then
Greek friends are permitted to
live "off-campus."

And so I supported the
belief that all sophomores
should be treated fairly and
made to live in residence halls.
But as I listened to the concerns
raised as to how fraternity
houses are going to maintain
their financial stability, how
they are going to fill their resi
dency quotas, and how the
College is going to support the
duty of Residence Life staff as
these changes affect living con
ditions (i.e. increased alcohol in
residence halls)I heard only
questions. More arguments
against than clarifying answers
were given. In my mind, sup
port was not provided, and it
seems as though most of these
changes have not been thought
out-we'll just "have to take
them as they come."
My question is this: If the
primary interest of Gettysburg

This proposed bill does
nothing but use taxpayers'
money to offer more excuses
for men to not pay child sup
port and further victimize
women. It does not address the
real, underlying problems, but
rather covers them up. All
those concerned should contact
their Representatives and im
plore them to vote against this
bill.
College is the students, why is
it then the students who are
receiving the short end of the
stick? We have had little say in
the proposed changes and are
silenced now by the rehearsed
answers of the committee and
College administration.
These changes are going
to happen, whether we like it
or not-regardless of the num
ber of meetings, forums, and
information sessions that are
held. What does a trustee who
graduated 20 to 30 years ago
truly know about the way col
lege life is today? If you want
first hand experience, I open up
my dorm room to you and wel
come you to live in the college
setting Residence Life staff
deals with day in and out.
Instead of causing more
problems, focusing on one part
of the college experience, and
targeting specific parts of stu
dent life; try making students
the true priority of the College.
Allow students who are inde
pendent and responsible the
opportunity to live off-campus
just as traditional Greek hous
ing is designed to do. Don't
take away those things which
get the students interested in
coming to college, but provide
alternatives for those who want
a better "residential experi
ence;" and will in the end be
sitting on the Board of Trust
ees and making decisions for
future students.
Respectfully,

the United States to women, world

by Christina Dickert tors a11 over the United States _-
Neoisolationism had its debut
Political Columnist at the end of the Cold War,
when the public was not sure
Over the past month, how America would respond to
"neoisolationism" has become the new political structure of a
the catch phrase of foreign multipolar world. During the
_policy makers and commenta- decade following the collapse

of the Soviet Bloc, the United
States took its title as the only
remaining superpower seri
ously by leading many multilat
eral forces against new threats
like Operation Desert Shield
and Storm, the humanitarian
efforts in Somalia, and its ef
forts to help stabilize the
former Yugoslavia. But, over
the past month, three actions
of the United States are telling
the world that it no longer
wants to he the world's watch¬

man. In early October, the
United Nations threatened the
U.S. to pay $550 million v
in back dues by the end V
of this year or the U.S. %
will lose its vote in the _^
General Assembly. This £\
is a little more than a _^^fll
third of the $1.7 bil- _^_BH
lion that the U.S. owes _^_r
the UN. Congress has al
ready appropriated $200 mil
lion, but the other $350 mil
lion needs to go through legis
lation.
Some Republicans in
Congress are seeing this as an
opportunity to add their per
sonal interests to any bill that
relates to the payment of UN
back dues. Representative
Chris Smith, a Republican from

New Jersey, wants to add a line
on the bill about restricting aid
to private family planning or
ganizations. Of course, this
will delay the passing of any
bill, but who cares about vot
ing in the United Nations while
we need to fight over domestic
issues that have been plaguing
Congress for the last quarter
century? Let's really think
about this before you answer.
And, yes, the Compre
hensive Test Ban Treaty. The
Senate voted down this treaty
because, according to the elo
quent Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, "It was a bad
treaty." Oh, okay. So, the
United States needs to hold
onto the right to test our
nuclear weapons while trying
to convince others not to?

When was the last time that the
U.S. proceeded with an under
ground nuclear test? Yup,
about a half century ago.
That's right, folks, fifty years
ago. I really don't think that
we need to hold onto this right.
If we want to move towards a
total disarmament, which is
what the United States claims
that as a long term goal, we
need to progress to that little
by little. And whether we like
it or not, the United States is
the leader of the world. Maybe
the U.S. (or should I say the Re
publican majority in Congress)
A needs to accept the re
M sponsibihty of being a
m role model.
|^_L Two weeks
_^^^^^ ago, Senator

Jse W _**
Helms had several congresswomen re
moved from a Senate hearing
because they wanted to give
him a letter signed by over 100
members of the House in sup
port of the treaty on the Elimi
nation of All Forms of Dis
crimination Against Women.
Helms asked the women to
"please act like ladies" and
when they refused to leave, he
had them escorted out by the
Capitol Police. Was this really
necessary? President Clinton
submitted the UN Convention
on Women's Rights to the Sen
ate five years ago, and Senator
Helms still has not scheduled
hearings for it, nor has he pre
sented it to the full Senate for
discussion and a vote.

What is wrong with this
picture? Why is Senator Helms
and his influence over the Re
publican majority in Congress

ruining the international image
of the United States? What is
so hard about actually paying
our bills to the UN on time? It
doesn't mean that we have to
constantly be held responsible
for every crisis that occurs.
The U.S. did not get involved
in the East Timor crisis— the
UN left the Australians and
other Pacific nations to lead
that peacekeeping effort. This
does not have to be a one time
affair— the United States could

use its general assembly vote
(which it is about to lose in two
months) to make crises more
of a regional responsibility
rather than a burden to be born
by the United States.
Why should the U.S. not
ratify a nuclear test ban treaty
and move towards setting the

example for moving to
wards a complete dis
armament of all
nuclear arsenals
. across the world? Is
\ it so hard to work
\ together? Do we
W constantly have to
_^ be watching over
to

_^k our shoulders see
_^ w ho is our "new"
enemy?
And is Jesse Helms that
threatened by women's rights?
Those women who asked for
his time were his equals
whether he likes it or not. 162
other nations have already rati
fies the women's treaty — is
the U.S. going to isolate itself
in respect to women's rights
too? Don't forget, people —
this is the man who holds the
strings to U.S. foreign policy in
Congress. Kind of a scary
thought, isn't it? The United
States helped to create the UN,
and now the majority feels as
though we have done our part,
so it is time to sit back and
watch. Is that really what de
mocracy is all about? Maybe
Jesse Helms should grow a
heart and feel some compas
sion towards man (and
woman) kind— all over the
world.

Statement

continued from page 11

that we have heard has been on
sophomore Rush. While some
student concern about this is
sue is understandable, it dis
turbs us that our conversations
have not been able to go be
yond this single issue. We are
wondering why that is.
Sophomore Rush will not
be the downfall of the Greek
system at Gettysburg. Many
colleges have adopted a sopho
more Rush process and have
thriving Greek organizations. If
the intention of the Commit
tee or the Board of Trustees had
been to tear down the Greek
system, we can assure you that
the Committee's recommenda
tions would have been much
more direct on this point and
the trustees' statement would

have looked quite different.
The only conclusion we can
draw from student reaction is
that the dwindling number of
students joining Greek organi
zations has become a concern
for those who are members.
They are worried about their
ability to maintain their orga
nizations, and any attempt to
make a change is perceived to
be a threat. Greek organiza
tions have experienced declin
ing membership over the past
decade nationwide. Any future
disappearance of Greek orga
nizations on this campus will be
due to decreased student inter
est in Greek life, not sopho
more Rush.
We believe that the ulti
mate impact of sophomore
Rush on this campus will be

We worked for the better
part of a year on our task and
submitted a report to the Board
of Trustees last May. Every rec
ommendation made to the
Board was unanimously ap
proved by all members-of the
Committee. After reading our
report, the Board of Trustees
developed the statement on
residential and social life that
has been the source of some
controversy here on campus.
This statement, while far-re
moved from the Committee's
report in its level of detail, re
flects the general vision of the
Committee.
With that context, we
would like to make some brief
observations about the trustees'
statement. First, they list many
policy recommendations that
have the potential to be of great
benefit to Gettysburg College
students. Unfortunately, we
have heard few comments
made about any of these except
sophomore Rush. We have
heard no one applaud the plans
for a new recreation/fitness
center and for enhanced social
space. We have heard no one
say that special programming
to improve the experience of
first and second year students
is a good idea, or that enhanc
ing opportunities for faculty/
student interaction could make
this a better place. We have not
heard a single student comment
on the importance of provid
ing better housing options for
upper-class students. Rather,
the focus of all conversation

positive. We work hard as an these organizations, which
institution to promote a sense seems to us to be appropriate_,
of community and identity re- We don't dispute the fact

lated to things academic
through the Residential College
program. We are, after all, a
community of learners. How
ever, this sense of community
disappears quickly during sec
ond semester Rush and pledg
ing. Moving Rush out of the
first year will reduce fragmen
tation and will allow us to ex
tend the first-year experience
we have been working so hard
to create. In addition, students
will have a full year to develop
strong academic habits before
the intrusion of Rush and
pledging, which many students
claim interfere with their abil
ity to do their best work. De
ferring Rush until the sopho
more year will also give stu¬

dents an entire year of experi
ence upon which to base the
decision of whether to join a
Greek organization and where
to affiliate if that is their choice;
retention of members by Greek
organizations is therefore likely
to be higher. Deferred Rush
will provide sophomor-e males
with the opportunity to remain
in supervised housing a little
longer, to expand their net
work of acquaintances and en
hance their sense of community
with the entire campus. Finally,
sophomore Rush will encour
age juniors and seniors to be
more actively engaged in their
fraternities and sororities and
to bear the primary responsi
bility for the functioning of

that there will be a short-term
financial impact of sophomore
Rush on fraternities. However,
the trustees have very gener
ously stated that the College
will work with the fraternities
to alleviate these difficulties.
That doesn't sound to us like a
group that is out to do away
with the Greek system.
We hope that Greek stu
dents on campus will quickly
change their mode of thinking
about the trustees' statement.
The trustees plan to strengthen

the residential and social expe
rience for all of our students in
a way that will complement
their academic experience. It is
our hope that our Greek stu
dents might now shift their fo
cus to how this change might
benefit their organizations and
how they might best adapt to
the new timetable. We also
hope that at least some of our
conversations might begin to
focus on the implementation of
the other policies included in
the trustees' statement.

Klan March Shows Just How Far We've Come

by Billy O Keefe Campus
Correspondent Columbia
College
The score at halftime was
6,000 to 17. And for once in
1999, the Bulls weren't the
ones taking the beating. Heck,
it wasn't even the Clippers or
the Browns.
Of course, these literally
sore losers would rather have
been anything but brown. No
problem there because they
were too busy being black, blue
and red in the face anyway.
In case the news is your

mortal enemy and you have no
idea what the heck you're read
ing here, let me bring you up
to speed.
Two Saturdays ago, in
New York City of all places, the
Klu Klux Klan came out to
march and drum up support for
God knows what they do these
days. As usual, allowing the
Klan to march led to a massive
outcry, but when the men with
the pointy hats cited the First
Amendment, the gates opened
and they were allowed to
march.
Good. Good?

Yes, good. Call it a Klan
march if you want to get tech
nical, but what that event
amounted to was nothing short
of a big party in celebration —
despite everything that makes
this countrv so damn dysfunc
tional — or just how far we've
come. In total, only 17
Klannies put on their crazy hats
and marched. Six thousand -
thousand! - protesters booed
them the whole way. Millions
more laughed at the whole

spectacle.
The angel kicked the
devil's ass.
The momentum was so
one-sided, two schoolteachers,
aged 56 and 62, were arrested
for disorderly conduct. Three
people even dressed as Klan
members just so they could
close in on the group and liter
ally get their kicks in. The
group's Grand Dragon left with
a shiner, and the next day's
New York Post had a picture of
him with a caption that dubbed

him as a coward. The title ot
the caption? "Lets playdress
up." It's enough to make you
love yellow journalism, if only
for a day.
I'll never be one to sup
port violence as a synonym for
victory or common sense. Still,
I've enjoyed every minute of
this story (and I admit hypoc
risy, so no need to point it out).
At the very least, the idea of
three guys whipping off their
pseudo-uniforms and popping
the real Klannies amuses me.

But mostly, the whole thing
makes me feel very, very good
about this scrappy country in
which we live, run by big busi
ness and cold machines but ul
timately ruled by well-meaning
people who have their hearts
in the right places. We may
compete with each other end
lessly and drive each other off
the road, but when a common
enemy like the KKK surfaces,
we still know what to do.
Love it or hate it, the First
Amendment protects every

So you know what? The

let them make a big stink on

Then let them embarrass the

When the stars come out
and the sky is clear, you can see
glittering, like little lights on
the Christmas tree,'hundreds
of millions of possibilities be
fore you, hundreds of millions
of avenues to travel and
thoughts to think.
In the five minutes or so
from one place to another,
the brisk winds cut you up
and slip under your clothes,
reminding you how warm it -
was where you just were.
Count those five minutes,
wishing that you were inside
under the covers, how you
were somewhere warmer than
right here in the chilly Novem
ber evening under a canopy of
endlessness.
Five minutes seems like
nothing, one blink of the eye
and the moment passed on,
fleeting, yet an eternity still.
You can burn five in no time
flat, without even thinking
about it, just sit and they're al
ready distant memories.
How crucial, then, are
those insignificant little incre
ments; just five more minutes
of sleep, just a few more and
you won't be late again for
your first class, only useful
when you need them, other-

don't have the time to do that.
Is the factor how good it looks
on your arm at a prom? How
good it looks in a vase or ar
rangement on the table? Per
haps it looks best in a bouquet
in the window of the store?
What good is a flower if you
can't enjoy its perfection with
out ruining them? People think
this little bloom outshines the
rest, is better than the rest. So
do I, because it does, whether
it likes it or not.
Time has much to do
with the canopy above. Ev
ery moment is unique, every
faint or loud second has a
character and a flavor all its
own. What you do with ev
ery opportunity and every
second either fulfills its po
tential or wastes it forever.
Once the door is closed there
_w are no second chances.

To sit back and take
each one as another shot,
another little adventure,
and to finally stop stressing
about it and start to enjoy the
time you do have, you've got
steps on everybody else who
wanders around, killing five
minutes till lunch or waiting in
traffic. Stop and look a bit, and
then realize what you have in
the garden, because finding
that out will make you happier,
if it hasn't had the chance to
already.

Voice mail

continued from page 11

not have much choice in this
matter. The phone switch up
grade was part of our overall
Y2k strategy, so it had to be
made this year. The original
date for the cutover was to be
the reading day weekend (Oct.
8), but unforeseen delays
caused the vendor to miss a key
hardware shipping date. We
would have liked to do the up
grade over Thanksgiving, but
we foresaw that the phone
switch vendors would begin to
get bogged down with Y2k
emergency calls at that time,
and as a result, we might not
get sufficient attention in case
we had a major problem with
the installation. This was a dif
ficult decision, but we believed
that we could perform the up
grade over a single weekend
with minimum disruption to
the campus. In the end, even
though much of the cutover
went well, we had more prob
lems than we anticipated.

Students have also asked
us why we made the change to
voice mail, and why they were
not involved in the decision
making process. We were un
der the impression that voice
mail was something that the
student body strongly desired.
For the past 3-4 years we have
received a steady stream of
complaints from students and
parents (including prospective
students) who were unhappy
with the fact that Gettysburg
did not have voice mail. Up

until last week, Gettysburg was
one of only a few colleges of
our type that did not have voice
mail. Students have also asked
what the benefit of voice mail
is. Voice mail is not just a sys
tem that saves phone messages,
but a system that genuinely
improves communication on
campus. For example, faculty
can communicate with their
entire classes via voice mail if
they choose to; or Campus se
curity can issue safety alerts to
the entire campus at a

moment's notice if the need
arises. It is available 24 hours a
day, on and off campus. Stu
dents can keep their voice mail
bbxes for all 4 years they are
here. With respect to the tech
nology fee that has been as
sessed, what is commonly per
ceived as a "voice mail fee" is
actually better thought of as a
comprehensive "technology
fee." The technology fee cov
ers network services (including
your computer connection),
daia and telephone line main
tenance, cable TV service and

telephone service, as well as
voice mail. This fee was estab
lished at $75 per semester; but
for this fall semester, the tech
nology fee was discounted $25
because voice mail was not
available at the beginning of the
semester. There is no charge for
voice mail for the fall 1999 se
mester. Starting in spring 2000
the full technology fee, includ
ing voice mail and all the other
services, is $75/semester. Com
pared to other institutions and
considering all the services you
receive, we feel this is a pretty
rpasnnahle deal-

In addition, Gettysburg,
like most institutions, is mov
ing in a direction similar to that
of the telephone industry, in
that long distance per-minute
charges are no longer being
used to subsidize (or artificially
lower) the per-semester
charges. As a result, we hope
to be able to lower our per
minute phone rates in the fu
ture. We hope this note clears
up some of the misunderstand
ings regarding voice mail.

Centennial Conference title for
the third year in a row. This
season's team also recieved a
bid to the Division III national
tournament.
In addition to these team
honors, many individual hon
ors were recieved as well. Se¬

broke the school record for
career goals. Fisher was also
named to the Centennial Con
ference first team along with

Junior midfielder Tabitha

able Mention.
Stambaugh and Fisher
will also represent Gettysburg
and the South region in the
annual North-South All Star
game to be held at Northeast

weekend.
Fisher was also named
Centennial Conference player
of the year for the second con
secutive year.
In the hearts and minds
of many players this was not
the way they envisioned the
end of the '99 season, however
they all look back with fond

.
There is no doubt that the
undying and unconditional de
votion of their fans is one sight
and sound that will never be
forgotten.
The blue and orange Dr.
Seuss hats that stood out at ev

down to rising senior's dads. It
is certain that the blue cowbells
will be revived next season as
a constant reminder of support
and enthusiasm. The dot board
will no doubt be recreated for
another season to chart the
team's progress.
Perhaps the only thing
missing from next years squad
will be the five graduating se
niors, Lisa Beideman, Tara
Chipko, Laura DeSario, Steph
Fisher and Amy Stambaugh,
who have believed in this team
for four years and led this
year's squad.
Their presence will surely
be missed but the game must
go on. They have left their
mark and they will always be a
part of the game and the game
will always be a part of them.

Steph Fisher

But Cantele's discus
sions after the losses helped
her to put them in perspec
tive: "She told us that we
weren't done with the season
and that we needed to focus
on the next game."
And Cantele admired
Steph's competitive spirit.
"She is extremely competitive
- in the most positive way. She
remains levelheaded no mat
ter what the obstacles might
be. She truly loves to com
pete and she is an excellent
leader," she said.
Steph mourns the field-

hockey season's end, yet she
will stay busy this year. On
November 20, she will com
pete, along with teammate Amy
Stambaugh, in the North/South
Division All-Star game, which
will take place in conjunction
with the Division I NCAA play

tinue. "It will be hard to sit on
the sidelines, but I will defi

Women's soccer crowned conference champions
again, but fall in first round of NCAA play

by Kristin Roberts
Staff Writer
The Gettysburg women's
soccer team is the official Cen
tennial Conference Champion
for the second year in a row
This is Gettysburg's fourth con
ference championship title in
the past seven years.
Included in the prestige
and excitement of this title was
a bid to the NCAA tournament.
This bid enabled the Bul
lets to join in the competition
leading to the national Division
III Champion title.
Adding to the outstand
ing outcome of Gettysburg's
season is the impressive feat of
having four players become All
Centennial selections.

Seniors Lauren Frankford
and Amy Brewster were se
lected to All-Conference first
team, for the third and second
times, respectively. Senior
Patsy Cors and junior Whitney
Jackson were named to the sec
ond team. All four women de
serve congratulations for these
distincitions.
The last two games in the
quest for the conference cham
pionship took place two weeks
ago, both at home. Both
matches resulted in Gettysburg
victory.
On Wednesday October
28, the Bullets hosted a rather

weak team from Bryn Mawr,
with a record of 0 wins. Get
tysburg outshot Bryn Mawr 22
0. Freshman Maura Tehrani
led the team, donating three
shots to the winning cause.
However, only one of the many
Bullet shots managed to slip by
Bryn Mawr'_s goalie.
Senior Lauren Scott
scored the lone goal of the day
in the 26th minute. Her first
game-winning goal ever was
assisted by a cross from sopho
more Emily McAuhffe from the
right side of the penalty box.
Following Scott's goal,
the Bullets prevented their op
ponents from matching her ef
fort and the remainder of the
game was scoreless.
Once the women easily
improved their conference
record to 9-0, they anticipated
the more challenging task of
prevailing as the only unde
feated Centennial team.

That challenge arose on
Saturday October 30, and its
instigator was the Green Ter
ror of Western Maryland.
Sentimental feelings were
mixed with the pressure of the
important contest, as the six
seniors on the team prepared
for their last home soccer game.
Lauren Frankford com
mented, "The seniors were ex
cited but nervous, because of
the threat that it could be our
last game ever." The reelings

Lauren Frankford's unforgettable career came to an end last
Wednesday against Elizabethtown in the first round of the
NCAA tournament.

of the seniors added to the al
ready high energy level of the
team, which helped fuel their
victory.
The Green turned out not
to be so Terr-ible, as the Bul
lets met with victory on the
sunny Saturday. The low-scor
ing match was hard fought by
both teams. Head coach Todd
Wawrousek declared the game
"an outstanding team effort
across the hoard."

Most of the first half was
scoreless, but in the 39th
minute, Frankford took advan
tage of Brewster's well-placed
corner kick assist. She success
fully shot to record the game
winning goal.
Although Gettysburg
outshot Maryland, the rival
team was not deficient in op
portunities. Goalie Erin
Hayden made three saves; she
accomplished this impressive

shutout after not being able to
piactice due to a concussion a
week earlier. The entire Bul
lets defense played well as a
team against the physical style
of Maryland's very skilled of
fense. Wawrousek was thrilled
with his team's showing on
October 30. He was pleased
to see the women mentally pre
pared and full of desire to win.
Each member of the team com
mitted herself to the triumph,
and the combination of these

things led to success and
achievement of the team's sea
son-long goal.
Honoring her feats as a
key defender for the Bullets
and the scorer of the goal that
bestowed the conference title
upon the team, the Centennial
Conference named Frankford
the Player of the Week.
Hayden also topped the charts
last week; she leads the con
ference in total goals against
her (just two) and in goals
against average (.23 goals per
same).

Last Wednesday the soc
cer team traveled to
Elizabethtown for the first
round of NCAA tournament
play. Despite shots from mul
tiple players, many of which
narrowly missed the net, the

Minutes later, Catanese

Miller's one-yard keeper
in the third quarter stretched
the Dickinson lead to 28-0.

Field hockey's fantastic season
comes to end, with 1-0 loss to Amherst

by Lisa Beideman
Staff Writer
Last weekend, the
women's field hockey team
traveled to Skidmore College in
Saratoga Springs, New York to
play Amherst College in the
second round of NCAA Divi
sion III playoffs. Their bags
were packed with shinguards,
uniforms, and dreams of cap
turing the national title.
Unfortunately, despite a
record-breaking season the
women fell short of fulfilling
that goal.
After Friday's practice on
the turf, a pregame meal and a
good nights sleep, the Bullets
were ready to turn their dreams
into a reality.

After one half of play, the
score remained tied at 0-0.
During a halftime talk, the
team was confident they could
turn this contest their way and
own it outright.
Towards the end of the
second half, this matchup
seemed to headed toward an
overtime period until with a
little more than three minutes
left, Amherst found the cage.

In an effort to tie the
score Gettysburg scrambled to
get the ball to their offensive
end and into the cage, but to
no avail. This loss knocked
Gettysburg out of the tourna
ment and brought an end to
their successful season.
Junior goalie Maureen
Giese recorded five saves on
the afternoon and Gettysburg
was outshot 9-4.
As the final whistle

sounded, a rush of emotion
overtook each member of the
team. This was a season not to
be forgotten.
Despite the fact that a
lofty milestone was unreached
this phenomenal team has ac
complished so much to be
proud of this season.
In August when the Get
tysburg college field hockey
team came back to campus for
preseason who would have

thought that this group of
women would have given so
much to a program?
Their enthusiasm, dedi
cated work ethic and optimism
for the season was the thread
that bound this team together.
"Every play, Every player," was
the theme that they chose for
the 1999 season and they did
indeed live up to this.
From the varsity starters
to the junior varsity players this

team supported and believed in
each other until the end.
Let's take a little trip
down memory lane and recap
this season.
The Bullets once again
beat Messiah College,4-3 after
upsetting them last season
when they stood ranked #1.
In a game against Bryn
Mawr the Bullets broke a team
record for most goals in a
game. As a unit the team re
corded nine goals in this shut
out. The team also came up
with a huge win, 2-1, against
William Smith a team that they
lost to last season.
After a come from behind
victory against the #1 ranked
team in that nation this year,
Lebannon Valley College, the
Bullets sealed their 13-0 win
ning streak, the best in Gettys
burg history.

Cantele celebrated her 100th
career victory in a win, 2-1,
against Centennial Conference
rival, Washington College.

Next stop: New Concord
Volleyball team optimistic as they set themselves for NCAA tournament

by Kristin Seaks
Staff Writer
Gettysburg's volleyball
team ended its regular season
on a high note, defeating
Millersville University last
Wednesday, 3-0. The scores of
the games were 15-13, 15-8,
and 15-7.
The Bullets played their
game well, and felt the match
went quickly.
Junior Nicole Evans put
up 38 assists during the match
and Catherine Schott, a senior,
contributed a team-high 18
kills and four blocks.

Megan Wargo, a sopho
more, brought up 13 digs in the
match and put down 11 of her
own kills. Freshman Lauren
Boyd also had a strong match,
with ten digs and a team-best
three service aces. Also, junior
Mary Guay played in the match
for the first time since she has
been injured.
Freshman Jessica
Wininger said, "Our defense
and our offense were equally
good."
Because that evening was
the last home match of the sea
son, the seniors on the team
were recognized. Schott, cap
tain of the Bullets volleyball

team, and Jenna McKinsey are
the team's seniors.
The Bullets record for the
regular season stands at 20-14.
With the completion of their
regular season, the Bullets are
now focused on preparing for
the NCAA playoffs
Wargo stated, "We played
really well and I hope we can
carry it through to this week
end." Evans added that their
momentum from the win will
also assist them in the playoff
games.
Gettysburg will make
their seventh consecutive ap
pearance in the Mid-Atlantic
regional round of the NCAA

playoffs. In their first match
Gettysburg's Bullets will com
pete against Alfred University.
The Bullets will travel to
Muskingum College in New
Concord, Ohio for the first
round of playoffs.
The match will be this
Thursday, November 11 at
7:30 pm.
Although the team does
not have feelings of nervous
ness and anxiety yet, some are
expecting those feelings to
come once they get to the play
offs. Alfred is currently ranked
fifth in the region, while the
Bullets are fourth. If Gettys¬

burg wins, they will advance to
play Muskingum College on
Friday.
McKinsey said, "Our
chances of advancing are
greater than they've ever
been." Part of the reason for this
is that Juniata College is not
one of the teams the Bullets will
face in the opening rounds of
the playoffs. If both teams ad
vance, there is a possibility of
meeting them later on.
The Bullets are going into
the opening rounds of NCAA
playoffs with confidence and
hopes of advancing to subse
quent rounds.

Fisher flanked with accolades as brilliant career ends
A time for change: Ail-American Field Hockey player reflects on four years, looks towards future

by Allison Small
Staff Writer
Only three minutes of
Saturday's game remained, and
senior field hockey player
Steph Fisher's heart sank as the
opposing team scored the lone
goal of the day.
As she watched the scene,
she knew Gettysburg now had
no chance of advancing to
wards the championship. Sad
ness overcame her as she also
realized her field hockey career

had now ended. After the
game, she retreated to her
family's home in Lewisburg,
Pennsylvania to get her mind
off of the Bullets' loss.
The loss did not sit well
with her, and she admitted that
she has "been an emotional
wreck the past few days—but
all in all it has been a great ex
perience." Although Steph and
her teammates may not have
enjoyed a winning finale, she
remains one of Gettysburg's
most decorated athletes.

Steph, a senior health and
exercise science major and a
Chi Omega sister, has reason to
feel happy about her impressive
field hockey feats.
Last week, she received
notice that the Centennial Con
ference had named her Player
of the Year for a second straight
year. She has also won a spot
on the North/South Division III

All-Star team. Steph recently
broke the college's record for
scoring the most goals in a ca
reer (44), and she fell one goal
shy of tying the college's record
for goals in a season.
"Steph is very deserving
of these honors. She is a dedi¬

cated and com
mitted athlete
who has worked
hard year round
to achieve her
goals," said
Head Coach
Carol Cantele,
who has coached
Fisher for four
years. "She is ex
tremely fit and
strong, which
has greatly im
pacted her game.
She has been a
big role player
for Gettysburg
throughout her
career."
Steph be
gan her career in
ninth grade

when several friends intro
duced her to the sport. "I ac
tually started playing relatively
late. I had been involved in
competitive gymnastics for
years, and I wanted to try
something new. I didn't know
a thing about field hockey."
Steph joined Lewisburg
High School's field hockey

team and played for four years
as both a forward player and a
midfielder. Despite suffering
broken bones and bruises, she
grew to love the intense excite
ment of the game.
When she enrolled at
Gettysburg, Steph knew she

wanted to continue playing
field hockey. She joined the
varsity team and loved it:
"I learned a lot, and the
seniors were so nice to me that
I really felt like I fit right in,"
she said. She also showed ex
cellence on the field.
According to Cantele,
"She has been a big role player

throughout her career. She has
served as the flyer on defensive
corners, as the hitter on offen
sive corners; and she is the
player who has the touch for
scoring goals."
"She's a hard-working
player, and I learned a lot from

playing with
her this season
because she is
so talented,"
Carrie Reeve,
a first-year
tea m mate,
continued.
To what
does Steph
credit her suc
cess? Accord
ing to her,

strong dynamics both
on and off the
field have in
fluenced both
her own and
Gettysburg's
impressive records.
"We do a
lot of stuff to¬

gether, and we really stress to
getherness. We have a bond
that makes us that much better
on the field," she said.
Besides stressing good
communication, the players
endured grueling, twohour
long daily practices almost ev
ery day of the season.
Steph said with each pass-

mg year, Coach Cantele has
demanded more from the play
ers. The Gettysburg team has,
consequently, improved this
year. The women won an im
pressive 17 games and only lost
four. "During the past few
summers, we have had to do
long runs, stick work, and a
weight-lifting program. So
people have started the season
in much better shape, " Steph
said. Steph, who has acted as
team captain for two years, re
called fond memories of the
team's many successes this year.
These include October's game
against top-ranked Lebanon
Valley, during which "both
teams played exceptionally
well. It went into overtime, and
we won a long, hard game," she
said.

But Steph also remem
bered upsetting games. Besides
losing this past weekend's
game, "the second time we
played Johns Hopkins, the
game went into double-over
time and we lost. That was
hard," she said.
Indeed, Steph has always
regarded competition very se
riously, and she felt a personal
loss during the few times that
other teams defeated Gettys
burg.

Dickinson prevails in ground war, ends Bullets' two game winning streak

From Staff Reports
Dickinson rushed for 324
yards, including a team-high
109 yards and one touchdown
by Mike Smith, to defeat the
Bullets 35-14 in Centennial
Conference (CC) action on Sat
urday.
With the loss, Gettysburg
fell to 3-6 overall (2-4 CC) and
was denied its first three-game
winning streak since 1995.
"They (Dickinson) con
trolled the ball on the ground,
which was something we tried
to do," said Head Coach Barry
Streeter. "And we had oppor
tunities, the other guys just

didn't pick up the slack."
Dickinson won for the
fifth time in six games to im
prove to 6-3 (4-2 CC) and stay
in the hunt for an ECAC
postseason game.
Bullet fullback Paul
Smith, who had amassed 725
rushing yards over the past two
games, was held to 19 yards on
10 carries and didn't play in the
second half due to injury. He
needs 399 yards to break the
NCAA alldivisions record for
career all-purpose yards held
by Brian Shay of Division II
Emporia (Kan.) St. (9,301).
Gettysburg was led by
backup fullback Zack Smith

(no relation) who carried 22
times for a career-high 144
yards and one touchdown.
Dickinson quarterback Sam
Miller carried 13 times for 45
yards and one touchdown and
also tossed a 55-yard scoring
pass to Mike Meagher as the
Red Devils jumped out to a 28
0 third-quarter lead and were
never threatened. Former Bul
let halfback Ben Catanese car
ried 11 times for 67 yards and
two touchdowns for
Dickinson.
Steve Menzel and Keith
Fischer each recorded three
sacks on the afternoon for
Dickinson while teammate Bob

Chesney led all players with 17
total tackles.
Ryan Moore made 16
tackles, including six solo stops,
to lead the Bullet defense.
Dickinson opened the
scoring on its first drive of the
game, marching 89 yards on 11
plays to take a 7-0 lead. Miller
connected on a 42-yard pass to
Brian Hoffner on the first play
of the drive and Mike Smith
capped the Red Devils' first
possession with a four-yard
touchdown run.
Midway through the first
quarter, Gettysburg drove 44
yards to the Dickinson 30 be
fore a dropped pass and an

incompletion on a fake field
goal ended the Bullets' threat
to tie the game.
"We dropped some balls
and we weren't hitting on the
cylinders like we had been be
fore," said Streeter. "The pen
alties that didn't hurt us the
previous couple weeks hurt us
because nobody was making
plays."
With 10:40 left in the sec
ond quarter, Miller and
Meagher connected on their
55-yard touchdown pass to cap
a six-play, 81-yard drive and
give Dickinson a 14-0 lead.

Gettysburg earns first round bye, begins NCAA play this weekend

by Robin Roger
Staff Writer
It was sink or swim on Saturday,
November 6. And the Bullets swam
away with the Conference title, leaving
Dickinson at the bottom of the ocean.
The victory came in the second sudden
death overtime period, with Jeremy
Shapiro's fifth game-winner of the sea
son. Dickinson presented Gettysburg
with its last conference challenge, one
the Bullets could not take lightly. In
fact, the game came down to one goal,
in the 115th minute. The Bullets may
not have had the extra time to get this
opportunity had it not been for a goal
in the 76th minute from senior Adam
Outerbridge.
Outerbndge's goal was the 8th of
his successful season, which also in
cluded five assists. He was aided by
senior Jason Vishio who tallied his 18th
assist, further burying the school and
conference records.
The Bullets' answer came 10 min
utes after Dickinson's Geoff Goldstein

scored in the 66th minute. The Red
Devils made the first offensive, but
could not score again after this. They
were out-shot 13-4.
The Bullets must have aimed for
suspense, because each respective goal
came within 15 and five minutes of the
whistle. Senior Chris Pryor ended the
anticipation with an assist to Shapiro,
who netted the winning goal. This was
Shapiro's 7th of the season, the 5th to
led the Bullets to victory.
Again, the Bullets defense held the
team together. They were able to stave
off the Red Devils for most of the game,
and only had one major breakdown.
Junior Nick La Porta posted three saves,
while the defense only allowed four
shots. The defensive effort showed most
in the two overtime periods, when they
had a shutout, despite a hole in their
depth. Freshman James Miller, who
would have been able to provide relief
to one of the outside backs, suffered a
concussion a week earlier. Much to his
frustration, he had to sit on the side
line—Doctor's orders. Hopefully he
will be back in action on Friday.

Yes, that's right. The Bullets next
game is Friday, November 12 at nearby
Messiah College.
It is their first NCAA playoff
game, and hopefully will not be their
last. The Bullets earned the top seed
in the Mid-Atlantic region and will face
either Ohio Wesleyan or Bethany at
Messiah (Grantham, PA) on Friday.
Game time is 7:30 p.m.
With a win on Friday, Gettysburg
would play Elizabethtown College or
Messiah on Saturday, November 13 at

7 p.m. in the regional finals.
The Bullets are making their third
straight NCAA appearance and their
sixth overall.
The men have appreciated the
huge fan support this season, especially
that of the Fiji brothers, and wish to
have that support continued.
Come out, if you can, and witness
the Bearded Ballhandlers in action. As
much as some of them need to shave,
we hope they will play a few more
games before they do.
