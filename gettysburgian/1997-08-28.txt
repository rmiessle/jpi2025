trouble

The Tau Kappa Epsilon house was set for renovations
this summer, but a few brothers decided to start early by caus
ing up to $50,000 worth of damage to the house on the last
two days of exams last May.
Now the house is closed and the brothers who dam
aged the house are being sued by TKE nationals.
The Psi chapter of TKE, founded at Gettysburg in 1926,
is "still operating as a fraternity, just with out housing," said
Jason Gareis, President of the Interfraternity Council.
It was rumored that the TKE brothers were being
housed at the Gettysburg Seminary. "Not true," said Gareis,

"Most of them are living off campus."
The decision to close the house was made by the
TKE alumni and national corporation. After the damage
had been assessed, the TKE housing corporation decided
to close the house for a semester.
"The house is not livable," said Gareis.
Renovations are planned for spring semester, and
brothers should be living in the house again by the fall of
1998. Current brothers will have to undergo a re-admit
tance process which includes interviews conducted by
alumni.
"This adds pressure from sources that had negative
ideas about the greek system," said Gareis. "It's fuel for
the fire."
"We're going to have to work hard to get more posi
tive publicity," said Gareis.

News Editor
At the close of the 1996
1997 academic year, Gettysburg
College chose to recognize mem
bers of the College's faculty with
awards for distinguished teaching.
Presented annually at the
College's commencement exer
cises, the Gettysburg College
award for Distinguished Teaching
was shared by two faculty mem
bers. The 1997 co-recipients of the
award were Professor of Chemis
try, Alex Rowland, and Professor
of English and Director of Theater
Arts, Emile Schmidt.
In recognizing Professor
Rowland, Gettysburg College Pro
vost Dan DeNicola said "Profes
sor Rowland has always been com
mitted to quality in undergraduate
science teaching, helping develop
the Organic Chemistry Test Form
for the Examination Committee of
the American Chemistry Society
and publishing several papers in
the Journal of Chemical Educa-

He continued, "By his ex
ample, Alex Rowland has shown
his students and younger col
leagues that one can do important
research of scientific significance
at a small liberal arts college."
DeNicola went on to say that
"Alex's name is synonymous with
Chemistry at Gettysburg College."
The Provost also recog
nized professor Schmidt, saying
"Emile's gift for making the world
of theater come to life in a practi
cal and imaginative fashion has
had a powerful and long-lasting
impact on the lives of his stu¬

dents." He stated that "Time and
again, individuals would rise to
make enthusiastic testimony to
Emile's teaching and his ability to
challenge them in pursuing their
life's goals."
Dr. Rowland earned his doc
torate from Brown University. He
began teaching at Gettysburg in
1958. In 1982, he was named
OCkershausen Professor of Chem
istry. Professor Schmidt earned his
Master's degree from Columbia
University. He began teaching at
Gettysburg in 1962. Along weith
his wife, Partricia Martell, he
founded the Gettysburg Summer
Theater, which ran for twenty-five

years. In addition to Professors
Rowland and Schmidt, Assistant
Professor of Biology, Veronique
Delesalle, received the Luther
W.and Bernice L. Thompson dis
tinguished Teaching award at the
Spring Honors Day program on
May 17. The award is given an
nually to a faculty member who
has come to Gettysburg College
within the past seven years and
whose teaching is recognized as
outstanding by faculty Colleagues.
Dr. Delesalle earned both
her bachelor's adn master's degrees
from McGill University. She lives
in Fairfield.

Beware the dangers of binge drinking

College Press Service
Jennifer, a Northwestern
University Junior, doesn't recall
how she ended up at Evanston
Hospital one early morning during
Spring Quarter last year. The last
thing she remembered was doing
tequila shots with a guy she met at
a fraternity party, and then her
world turned black.
Jennifer had a blood alcohol
level of about .21, more than twice
the legal limit in Illinois, and was
unconscious when friends took her
to Evanston Hospital's emergency
room. Her breathing was irregu
lar, and her friends told her that she
looked like a ghost.
"I was so scared," Jennifer
says as she shakes her head and
looks at the floor. "It was one of
the worst moments of my life. I
thought I was having such a good

GCPR A Gettysburg College ad
ministrator has co-written the first
book dedicated to examining the
history and significance of Devil's
Den in the Civil War Battle of Get
tysburg.
Garry E. Adelman, a life
long students of Civil War history,
has co-written "Devil's Den: A
History and Guide" with Timothy
H. Smith. The book was published
in June by Gettysburg-based Tho
mas publications. Both Adelman
and Smith are licensed guides for
the Gettysburg National Military

photo by _Mt* _Astrom
Park. Our goal in writing this book
was to bring to Devil's Den the
attention ft deserves as a promi
nent, but often overlooked, part of
the three-day battle," said
Adelman.
The book details the history
and folklore surrounding the site,
covers in-depth the events during
the battle, and concludes with a
detailed guide for visitors.
Adelman joined Gettysburg
College in 199S as part of the
College's dining services opera
tion.

time, and then I wake up in the
hospital with a needle in my arm."
Doctors had to hook Jenni
fer up to an IV to dilute her blood
quickly and lower her blood alco
hol content. Jennifer, who doesn't
want her last name used, says the
experience changed her life be
cause she is one of the lucky ones.
She is still alive.
At least 800 high school and
college students died from alcohol
poisoning in 1994, but researchers
think the number might be higher
than 4,000 because many deaths
related to alcohol may be attributed
to other causes like cardiac arrest,
according to Students Against
Drunk Driving.
Annann Hong, an alcohol
substance abuse educator at NU's
Searle Student Health Service.

isn't surprised to learn about
Jennifer's experience. She often
hears of drunk students who are
found in odd places on campus,
then shipped into Evanston Hos
pital for care.
A recent survey conducted
by the American Medical Associa
tion showed that 40 percent of 800
eighteen to thirty-year olds drink
to levels that impair judgment and
physical performance.
The results demonstrate a
sad, unconscionable waste of tal
ent and potential by our country's
young people," says Nancy
Dickey, chair ofAMA's board of
trustees.
Although many people mis
take alcohol for a stimulant be
cause it can make people more

lively than their usual selves, al
cohol is actually a depressant. If a
person drinks enough alcohol it
can shut the body's immune sys
tem down and affect the circula
tory and respiratory systems.
Hong points out that many
people don't know that alcohol
alone can kill you, and you don't
have to be into the driver's seat to
die from it.
"People are afraid of taking
someone into the hospital because
of the possible consequences, or
they think that the person is passed
out and will be OK in the morn
ing," Hong says. "But this is seri
ous and instead of worrying about
the person getting in trouble, I
think it's more important that you
could be saving that person's life."

A SADD brochure lists sev
eral cases in which young adults
have died from alcohol poisoning,
including a story about Marie
Brinkmeyer. She was 18 and a
first-year student at Texas A&M
University when she bought a
bottle of tequila and took it to a
dormitor party. After drinking
heavily, Brinkmeyer collapsed adn
was carried to her bed to sleep it
off. She never woke up.
"I don't think people are
aware of all the damage alcohol
can do," says Dr. David Barthwell,
medical director for the drug and
alcohol program at Northwestern
Memorial Hospital in Chicago.
"Alcohol companies make alcohol
look so appealing, but the truth is,
if you aren't careful, it can kill
you."

Involvement, participation required for success, says Nordvall
Dean of First Year Students urges new arrivals to get involved

GCPR When students first come
to college, the number of pos
sible activities to join is over
whelming. In addition, there is
the academic challenge of col
lege courses, dean of First Year
Students, Robert Nordvall, rec
ommends that students take their
time reviewing the options avail
able and deciding the activities
in which they want to participate
at Gettysburg, but he notes that
first year students should become
involved in the life of the Col
lege. A leading scholar on
the affect that college has upon
students is Dr. Alexander W.
Austin of the Cooperative Insti
tutional Research Program at

UCLA. Dr. Astin os an alumnus of
Gettysburg College. His work indi
cates that the quality of the educa
tional experience that students get in
college is directly related to how
much they are involved both inside
and outside the classroom in their
college experience. Not surpris
ingly, students who put more effort
into college, receive much greater
benefits from their four years of
higher education.
Dean Nordvall empha
sizes, however, that although almost
all activities provided benefits, not
all co-curricular activities are equal
in what they provide to students.
Students should look for activities
that provided to them strong oppor
tunities for personal growth. A small
group of activities that have proved
particularly powerful in fostering the

growth and development of stu
dents are the service learning pro
grams and community service pro
grams, and opportunities for inde
pendent study and research with
professors. There are activities
that students name as particularly
important as they reflect upon their
four years at Gettysburg. There
four are not the only activities that
play such a role, and students can,
of course, take part in a number of
very beneficial activities at the
College. The Gettysburg Is Volun
teering (GIV) Day activities on the
Monday afternoon of Orientation
from 6:30 pm - 8:00 pm there will
be an Open House at the Center
for Public Service at which stu
dents can find out more about com
munity service and service learn¬

ing programs. Study abroad op
portunities will be discussed in the
rotating discussion sessions on
Monday morning of Orientation.
First year students do not ordi
narily work on research and inde
pendent study projects with pro
fessors, but during their first year
students should be sampling the
various academic programs at the
College in order to find out which
programs offer the academic chal
lenges and opportunities that are
most attractive to them.
Service learning pro
grams, community service pro
grams, study abroad, and indepen
dent study and research are pow
erful experiencesbecause they
stretch students. They force stu
dents to do and see new things.

They force students to look at the
world differently. Students can
graduate from Gettysburg College
without participating in any of
these programs, but students who
want to experience the full range
of a Gettysburg College education
should select the best opportuni
ties that the College has to offer,
both inside and outside of the class
room.

Gardner garners safety award
College recognizes staff member's contribution

Terry R. Gardner, a car
penter in the facilities services
department at Gettysburg Col

Gettysburg: A Beginner s Guide

"I'll meet you in fif
teen minutes at Stine Lake and
we can head over to Servo. Or
maybe we can just go to LD's,
but first I have to swing over to
the CUB and hit the MAC."
Your friend just called
and left this message on you
answering machine. You've
been here for less than a week,
so naturally you think, "what is
he talking about?" Have no fear,
new student, because this handy
litle glossary of Gettysburg
speak is sure to get you through
these social straits unscathed
and sounding like an old 'Burg
pro. First things first. "Where
am I now?" and "You want me
to go where?"

Servo: a.k.a. the Din
ing Hall. Probably nicknamed
back when the college's dining
service was contracted out to a
company called Servomation
(eons ago). Anyhow, you eat
here. Tip: Get here early on
Premium Entree Night. The
Cordon Bleu rules.
CUB: a.k.a. The Col
lege Union Building. Here you
will find the mailroom, school
store, ballroom, first-year stu
dent laundry room and the cam
pus alternative to Servo, Cafe

101. The Junction (for -
merly known as the Dive):
This is a place that studetn or
ganizations can hold meetings,
the Student Activities Council
has live performances and mov
ies, and where students can just
hang out. Cafe 101: a.k.a. the
Bullet Hole. Looking for a
quick snack while you're on the
run? Travel beyond the Junc
tion, past the mailroom, and
you're in The Hole. You have
$3.75 on you meal card that's
good for breakfast, lunch and
dinner. Remember, only two
prepackaged items per meal.
The catch to Cafe 101 is that
you can only use your meal

cards at specific hours: 8:00 -
10:15 am for breakfast, 1:30 -
4:00 pm for lunch, and 4:30 -
9:00 pm for dinner. However,
it stays open until midnight in
case you're in the mood for a
late night snack.
Mailroom: Every
weekday, between 11:30 am and
1 pm, the mailroom transforms
from a drab series of metal
boxes into the very epicenter of
social activity at Gettysburg
College. Here the evening's
plans are made, adn flirting is
perfected, check your mail,
two, three, four times a day!
MAC: a.k.a. Money
Access Center, this is an auto
mated teller machine outside the
CUB. It's the same as MOST,
Cirrus, or whatever you're used
to. This innocent-looking ma
chine cna be both a Friday night
life-saver and a Sunday morn
ing nightmare. Beware of the
lure of fast cash.

Mussdman Library:
It's Tuesday night and nothing's
going on. where can I go to
hang out and meet new people?
The Library is the answer. On
any given evening, the first
floors are filled with students
pretending to study while pick
ing up the lastest gossip on cam
pus. Plus, when you get home
and find that your parents have
called, you can honestly say that
you were at the library. But be
ing there and studying are two
entriely different issues. If you
really need to do some work, the

third adn fourth fllors are your
best bet. Night owls will be
happy to see that the library is
opne 24 hours a day. And for
those slaves to the almighty
bean, librarians brew coffee and
provide hot water for tea adn
cocoa for those students pulling
all-nighters. Also, the library
has three day/three movie video
rentals. They may not have all
the newest releases, but they do
have some of the best movies
ever made. The library is one
of the three "Mussleman" loca
tions on campus, the others be¬

ing Mussleman stadium, and If the phone rings once > it > s an
Mussleman Hall, located in the on.campus cal, and you can risk

Upperclass Quad.
Bream Wright
Hauser: This is the campus gym
adn field house. It's located be
yond the CUB adn across hte
street from the Apple apartments.
Be sure you don't confuse Bream
with the...
PlankGym: This older
gym is found between the CUB
and Masters Hall. There's a
games room adn fitness room in
the basement. WZBT, the col¬

lege radio station at 91.1 FM is
located in the basement. Make
some requests and bug the DJ by
dialing x6313. Many studetn or
ganizations also call Plank home,
including the Student Activites
office, GECO (enviornmental
concerns organization), the Black
Student Union, Student Senate,
the Gettysburgian, the Spectrum
(yearbook), and the IFC (Inter
fraternity Council), the Center
for Public Service is also in
Plank, but on the first floor.

Stine Lake: Not really
a lake at all, Stine Lake is actu
ally the open area between Plank
Gym and the library. One theory
for the origin of its odd name may
be that the field is known to flood
during heavy stroms. Almost
knee-deep water is not unusual
on the "lake." Afteranastystorm,
put on old clothes, go out, slide
around and have your own little
Woodstock.

BruaHalLKIine The
ater, and Stevens Theater:
These are all the same place and
for that reason, it can get rather
confusing.
Schmucker Hall: This
is the colege's art and music
building. Stop in and check out
the art gallery which is filled with
the work of your fellow
gettysburgians. Frequent recitals
and concerts there, too. and
they're free!
Other Important Stuff
OneRing/T woRings:

answering it with a more creative
greeting. If it has a double ring, it's
most likely Mom and shoudl be
anwered accordingly.
The Weather Guy(s):
There are two numbers you can cal to
get time adn hte local weather. These
numbers are helpful, but they can
becoem serious habits. You'll soon
find yourself calling them before you
walk across the hall. Anyway, here's
the spiel: 337-1234: Your basic com
puter guy with time and weather.
334-0505: Advanced system
run by the local newspaper, The Get
tysburg Time. This one gives you
options. Dial 1131 for a three day
forecast. You can also get daily horo
scopes, sports scores and dirt on the
day's soaps.

Menu line: By dialing
MENU (6368), you cna get the day's
selections at Servo. However, if the
line is busy, you can access their web
site at http://
dining.www.gettysburg.edu.

and hit the diner. A plethora of tasty

burgers, sinful desserts and colorful
late night patrons are sure to be on
hand to keep you entertained. Try the
beef gravy on the fries. It rules.
Pizza, pizza, pizza: Each
with its own pros adn cons, the
gettysburg area has many pizza places
but only threee deliver - Piza House,
Little Ceasar's and Dominos. If you
have the ways and means (i.e. a car),
Stavros Pizza in Emmitsburg, just
over the Maryladn line, is well worth
the trip.

Ernie's Texas Lunch: Lo
cated across Chambersburg Street
from K&K Records, Ernie's has been
catering to the lunch adn dinner
crowds of Gettysburg for three gen
erations. An "Ernie Dog" is not to be
missed, and for those vegetarians out
there, Ernies offers "The Dummy" - a
hot dog bun, all your favorite hot dog
toppings, but no hot dog. Ernie's is
the perfect place for thoese looking to

College receives grant for Civil War Studies program
Luce Professorship to begin in 1999

GCPR Gettysburg College has
been awarded a grant of more than
$500,000 from the Henry Luce
Foundation to support the estab
lishment of a professorship in
Civil War studies. The Henry R.
Luce Professor of the Civil War
Era will lead an undergraduate
program in Civil War studies and
will develop and direct "The Get
tysburg Semester," a program se
lecting students from across the
country to participate in a semes
ter of intensive interdisciplinary
study of the Civil War era.
Funds from the grant,
which covers an initial period of
six years, will be used primarily
to provide salary and benefits for
a faculty member chosen to fill the
Luce Professorship. The grant
was announced by the
Foundation's Chairman Henry
Luce III. The Luce Professor will
be selected by a committee at the
College after completion of a na¬

tional search.
The recipient's appoint
ment will be made in 1998, and the
Luce Professor will begin teaching
at Gettysburg by the fall of 1999.
Gettysburg is one of only
tow higher education institutions to
receive a professorship from the
Luce Foundation during this year.
The other was Johns Hopkins Uni
versity. "Gettysburg College is
very grateful for the support of the
Luce Foundation which will allow
us an opportunity to develop great
strength in Civil War studies, we
sincerely believe that we can de
velop a program unmatched at any
other site in the country," said Gor
don Haaland, president of Gettys
burg College. "Our aim is to use
of existing relationships with the
community of Civil War scholars
and our natural geographic connec
tion with the pivotal battle of that
War to establish an integrated first-

rate undergraduate program that
allows not only our students but
also visiting students access to a
unique combination of scholarship
and original research materials."
"Many of the basic issues
of contemporary American society
came into focus during the Civil
War era, among those being the
relevance of race in a democracy,
the proper balance of federal and
state government, the principles
that bind Americans, the meaning
of a union. We think that a
multidisciplinary examination of
the Civil War era is a wonderful,
rich, and sound way to examine
our social fabric," said Dr. Daniel
DeNicola, the college's chief aca
demic officer.
"The professorship will
provide scholarly leadership for an
intensive program in this era, ad
dressing not only the causes and
events of the Civil War and its af
termath, but its cultural and intel¬

lectual milieu. The program will
draw on not only miliary and po
litical history, but, among many,
the fields of economics, sociology,
philosophy, African-american
studies, women's studies, rhetoric,
religion, literature, the visual arts,
and music. Such a study helps us
understand what was changed and
what was preserved by the war,
what was lost and gained," added
DeNicola.
The Henry R. Luce Pro
fessorship Program wa established
in 1969 by the New York-based
foundation to encourage academic
innovation and creativity through
integrative and interdisciplinary
approaches to teaching and re
search in American private higher
education.
The first recipient of the
Luce Professorship in Civil War
Studies will be responsible for fur
ther developing existing College
curricular programs into an aca¬

demic concentration or minor pro
gram, with direct responsibility for
teaching the introductory and
capstone courses in that program.
By the third year of the grant, the
Luce Professor will develop and
the direct "The Gettysburg Semes
ter," for which up to 25 under
graduate students will be selected
from applicants across the coun
try for a one-semester, integrated
program of Civil War studies.
"We will continue to sup
port the Luce Professor, the estab
lished Gettysburg program, and
the Gettysburg Semester upon the
completion of the six-year Luce
grant period," said DeNicola.
"The college has the option of ap
plying to the Luce Foundation for
three additional years of support,
and we are confident that our pro
grams will show sufficient
progress and strength to warrant
serious consideration."

College receives Kline Grant

$200,000 awarded for renovation of Carlisle House

GCPR Gettysburg College has re
ceived a grant of $200,000 from
the Josiah W. and Bessie H. Kline
Foundation, Inc., which will be
used to partially fund renovations
to a residence facility for students
dedicated to addressing issues re
lating to wellness and healthy
lifestyles.
The grant will be paid in
equal installments during a five
year period by the Harrisburg
based charitable foundatio. The
renovation project, which will in
clude interior and exterior im
provements, along with a overhaul
of the mechanical and electrical
systems of the building, will be
gin this summer and will be com
pleted next summer.
"The continuing generous
support of the Kline Foundation
will enable Gettysburg College to
accelerate the completion of a sig¬

nificant renovation.," said Gordon
A. Haaland, president of Gettys
burg. "The concept of specialty
housing, in general, and this
wellness house, in particular, em
body a critical aspect of a Gettys
burg education, that of combining
classroom learning with students'
cocurricular activities and social
activism."
The studen t housing unit to
be renovated, the Carlisle House,
is one of IS specialty housing units
established by the College to allow
students with shared interests an
opportunity to pursue their goals in
a common residence.
The Carlisle House was es
tablished in 1990 as a result of stu
dent requests. Students choosing
to reside in the building commit to
planning three programs each se
mester which focus the attention of
the campus community on

wellness, including issues of sub
stance abuse.
The Kline Foundation was
established in 1952 exclusively for
charitable, scientific, literary and
educational purposes.
Both Josiah and Bessie
Kline served at one time as trust
ees of Gettysgburg College. The
foundation has supported previous
projects at the College involving
the construction of the Mussleman
Library and new athletic complex,
and the renovation of facilities for
the theater program and one of the
College's original buildings. A
scholarship fund named in honor
of Joseph Simpson, a former presi
dent of the foundation and College
trustee, has also been established
at Gettysburg.

Eddie Plank's birthday bash sure to hit a home run Sunday

by Paul Hutchinson
Contributing Writer
This Sunday, August 31,
Gettysburg College will be cel
ebrating the birthday of one of its
own: Baseball Hall of Famer
Eddie Plank. The organizations
housed in Plank Gymnasium,
named for the old southpaw (in
layman's terms, a left handed
pitcher), have joined together to
honor our hometown hero, wel
come old friends and new, and
have themselves a party!
Born on August 31, 1875,
Plank practiced pitching by hurl
ing balls at bales of hay at his farm
north of town. By 1900, he was
playing for the Gettysburg College
Battlefields, and in 1901, the first
year of the American League, he

was pitching for the Philadelphia
Athletics.
Every year from 1903 until
his retirement in 1917, Plank had
— T7D A -._f I_^_nn
ivn ui i

Browns.
Plank retired in 1917 with a
326-194 record, 69 shutouts, and

_„
an _x_^_ca_»
than 3.00. He
played in the
1905 World Se
ries against the
New York Gi
ants, then again
in rematches in
1911 and 1913

What: Party
When: Sunday At 6pm
Where: Plank Gym

In 1915, I
he left the Athletics for St. Louis
and the new Federal League, but
after a 21-11 season, the league
dissolved. Plank went across town
for the 1916 season and finished
his career with the St. Louis

a 2.35 ERA, giving up fewer walks
than any other pitcher with over
4,000 innings of work. After his
years in the majors, Eddie came
back to Gettysburg, opened a ga
rage in town and even lived in the

of college, making Gettysburg
College the only college men
tioned in the Hall of Fame.
Eddie Plank's baseball card
is one of the rarest baseball cards
of all time. Rumor also has it that

am
house now occupied by Phi Sigma
Kappa. He died of a stroke in 1926
and was inducted into the Baseball
Hall of Fame twenty
iianvii Iota**

There are some
interesting facts con
cerning Eddie Plank.
Although not a gradu
ate of the College,
Eddie's plaque in
Cooperstown refers
to his roots in Adams
County stating that he
was recruited just out

he was the first pitcher to throw a
curveball, but this issue has been
debated for decades.
"Gettysburg Eddie's" birth
day party will begin at 6 pm on
Sunday in the basement of Plank.
Along with cake and ice cream,
compliments of Kilwins, all of the
organizations will leave their doors
open. These organizations include
WZBT, the school radio station;
GECO, the environmental club;
the Spectrum, the yearbook; and
the Gettysburgian. So come by on
Sunday evening, and wish Eddie
a very happy birthday, wherever he
is.

"Cotton" the act

Student band rocks Junction to packed house

byBarbDickson FeatuKS Editor
The Junction pumped with
music Sunday night, as many up
perclassmen spent their first nights
back on campus dancing the night
away. Cotton Roberts performed to
a large crowd for two hours, intro
ducing the first year students to the
Junction and getting upperclass
men back into the swing of things.
Cotton Roberts is a five per
son band, three of whom have at
tended Gettysburg College. The
band began this summer when Jon
Pistey, who graduated in May, and
Nate Bowen, '98, got together and
decided to form a band.
According to Bowen, Pistey
asked if he wanted to be in a band,
and Bowen gave a noncommittal
answer. Eventually, though, it be
came less of a "whatever" answer
and more of a definite plan.

They were joined by current
senior Chris Paumi and Chris Fos
ter, a friend of Pistey's from
Greece. It was only recently that
Jen Knight, the lead singer, joined
the group.
"We wanna rock," says

Pistey of the group. Cotton Rob
erts, he explained, was a character
in a Willie Nelson movie called
Honeysuckle Rose. The character
was a "total cheeseball" and
mocked by the other characters in
the film. The band liked the idea
and chose that for the name.
The band started at 10 to a
packed house, which fluctuated
throughout the evening. There
was, however, always a number of
people in the front, dancing to the
loud, pounding music.
"It was a lot of fun to dance
to," commented sophomore Krissi
Fisher. "A great way to meet out
going first-years." There were
some of these brave first year stu
dents in the front, dancing away
with the upperclassmen.
Cotton Roberts is the first
band to play the Junction this
school year. They were quickly
followed by blues artist K. J. James
on Wednesday afternoon, and this
Saturday night with the first Cof
feehouse of the year.

The band's music consisted
of both original music and classics
such as "Bad Moon on the Rise"
and "Old Time Rock V Roll."

which ended the evening. "Don't
ask for an encore," said Pistey, "be
cause you're not going to get one."
Pistey made comments
throughout the night As a recent
graduate, he remarked, "I'm
amused to be up here...Four years
ago I was down there," gesturing
to where the audience sat. Pistey
now works in the basement of the
library.
Everyone at the Junction
seemed to be enjoying the band.
"The vocalist was excellent," com
mented sophomore Christine
Sedlacko. "[She had a] great
voice." To make this even more
impressive is the fact that Knight,
the lead singer, only joined the
group a few weeks ago.
Cotton Roberts is a band in
transition, however. Both the
drummer, Foster, and Bowen are
not able to be in the band any
longer, so Pistey is again looking
for the musically inclined to join
his band.

.The fate of the band is yet
to be sealed, but they did their job
Sunday night: the Junction rocked.
And that's just what Pistey wanted.

Previews mislead, but this "Theory" is worth the proof

by Jon Fr oehhch
StaffWriter "I don't know what I know,
but I know it's big." - Jerry
Fletcher Though the television pre
views for "Conspiracy Theory,"
starring two of Hollywood's best
looking and well known faces Mel
Gibson (Lethal Weapon, Mad
Max) and Julia Robers (Pretty
Woman, The Pelican Brief), give
viewers the stereotypical appear
ance of an action movie, this illu
sion is forgotten not long into the
movie.
The previews show scenes
that, though indeed from the
movie, seem to be taken totally out
of context. Perhaps these scenes
of car chases andSWAT team
sieges are what draw many audi
ences to the theater, but it is easy
to forget what one expected to see

because of the way this clever, ex
citing, and only semi-action movie
is presented.
Although a misrepresenta
tion of a movie in its previews is
usually a sign that it has something
to hide, audiences will most likely
be pleasantly surprised by this new
film from director Richard Donner
(Superman, The Goonies).
Jerry Fletcher, played by
Gibson, is a New York taxi driver
whoisabitofaheadcase. Though
some might insist that New York
cabbies are nuts by definition,
Fletcher is definitely a special case.
This character seems to
bring out the best in Gibson be
cause he both gives him a chance
to do some real acting and because
Gibson's natural charm and humor
gives the fictional Jerry Fletcher
the human touch that audiences
crave.

By the time the movie starts,
Fletcher is already in the midst of
a rather one-sided relationship that
borders on stalking with govern
ment worker Alice Sutton, played
with heart by Julia Roberts.
In accordance with the title,
Jerry is convinced that everything
is a government cover-up and is
trying to alert the public through
his newsletter: Conspiracy Theory.
He is the kind of guy who doesn't
trust anyone - except Alice Sutton.
Sutton understandably
doesn't believe Fletcher and is a
little annoyed with his ravings
about such things as sperm
samples from the fathers of Nobel
Prize winners being stored under
the ice at Rockefeller Center. How
ever, her internal kindness won't
permit her to watch Jerry get
locked up or to stop Jerry from
growing on her.

The plot of Conspiracy
Theory really gets moving when
what the viewer suspected all
along is revealed to be true: Jerry
is paranoid for goodreason. This
reason is personified by the su
premely evil Doctor Jonas, played
perfectly by Patrick Stewart (Star
Trek - the Next Generation, Robin
Hood: Men in Tights). Though
Jerry is convinced that he is being
chased because his newsletter has
hit a nerve with the government,
Jonas is in pursuit of Jerry for a
reason left unknown to audiences
until the end of the movie.
Conspiracy Theory marks
another success in the vast collec
tion belonging to acclaimed direc
tor Richard Donner. Donner, hav
ing previously worked with
Gibson on both the Western com
edy Maverick and all three install
ments of the police action trilogy

Lethal Weapon, seems to have ac
quired both the skill of utilizing
Gibson to his fullest potential as
well as that of making an exciting
movie with a balanced combina
tion of action, drama, and humor;
all three are abundant in Con
spiracy Theory.
The only gripe one could
possibly have with this movie is
that the ending is, for the lack of a
more descriptive word, cheesy.
But the fact remains that many
people, though they won't be quick
to admit it, like cheesy stuff. We
see plenty of reality every day.
Part of the reason we go to the
movies is for a change - and that's
OK. Conspiracy Theory wasn't
afraid to give audiences what they
want. This fact plus great casting
and a gripping plot make Con
spiracy Theory one of the few truly
good movies to come out this
summer.

Suspense movie will
make you Scream

byBarbDickson Features Editor
The movie Scream opened
last winter to critical acclaim and
high popularity. The latest movie
from Wes Craven, the director of
the horror classic Nightmare on
Elm Street, was an almost instant
hit. The story is that of a small
town in California, Santa Rosa. It
focuses on the lives of a group of
five students who attend
Woodsboro High School. The
main character is Sidney (Neve
Campbell), whose mother was
murdered almost a year before the
action in the movie takes place.

Her life is once
again disrupted
as two of her
classmates are
brutally mur
dered one night,
and the killer
then focuses on
Sidney. She
doesn't know

who to trust and who not to trust.
And the body count just keeps ris
ing. The plot sounds like that of
a typical horror movie. There is a
wonderful twist, though. It's a
horror movie about teens who
grew up watching horror movies.
They know all of the cliches, and
Sidney's friend Randy (Jamie
Kennedy) tells us "the rules": how
to survive a horror movie. At a
party, as the group watches a hor
ror movie, Randy lists them for us:

-Don t answer the phone
-Don't open the door
-Don't have sex
-Don't drink or do drugs
-Don't go back in the house
-Don't hide in the closet
-Don't just stand there
-Don't trip

-Don't say "I'll be right
back," because you won't be
The list goes on. There are
also numerous references to other
movies, and a comment is made
at one point about a horror movie
director named Wes Carpenter
(combining Craven's name with
that of John Carpenter, another
horror director).
The movie is highly enter
taining and keeps you guessing
throughout. It isn't until the very
end that you have any idea who
the killer could be. The ending

was done wonderfully, with shock
and suspense mixed powerfully to
gether.
The cast was perfect, though
Skeet Ulrich (Last Dance, The
Craft) as Billy, Sidney's boy
friend, was a little too reminiscent
of Johnny Depp's character in A
Nightmare on Elm Street.
Campbell was perfect as the al
most perfect Sidney. While there
was an element of the audience
wanting to protect her, there was
also a feeling that she could take
care of herself.
That is part of what makes
Scream such a great movie. In
many horror movies, you almost
want the charac
ters to be killed
because they are
viivmiw

CY\ 1
"Do you
like scary
movies?"-

uvvuuuv r
sostupid. In this
movie the char
acters are not
dumb; after all,
they grew up on
this stuff. In
stead of con
stantly saying to

yourself, "What an idiot!", you'll
be saying, "Great idea!" These

characters know how to think for
themselves.
Cameos are made by Drew
Barrymore as Casey, the killer's
first victim, and Henry Winkler as
Mr. Himbry, the school principal.
It is the killing of Casey that brings
us into the story and gives us a hint
of what is to come: as the killer
talks to her on the phone, he quiz
zes her on such movies as Friday
the 13th and Halloween.
Courtney Cox is also in the
cast as Gale, a local television
news reporter always trying to get

the story first. You love to hate
her, though you might just change
your mind later on.
There is a sequel already in
the works, though it makes you
wonder whether Scream will turn
into another Friday the 13th with
a string of horrible sequels.
This is a movie that keeps
you on your toes the whole way
through. The script was brilliantly
(as much as you can use that word
to describe a horror movie) writ
ten by Kevin Williamson. The
conclusion of it comes as a shock.

If you like horror movies, this is a
definite must-see.
Note: Scream will be play
ing tonight outside of Plank Gym
or inside the Junction if it rains.

Dear Casey...

Dear Casey:

While I know that its ther efor

do you have so that I don't
charge too much?

Sincerely,
Charged Up
Dear Charged Up,
First, you must realize
that having a charge account is a
right, not a privledge. In essence,
it is a step towards that ingima
many refer to as reality. Being
afraid of going charge crazy is
probaly not uncommon among
college students because of the
ease in which that piece of plastic
makes buying all those
"neccessary items." Here are some
tips that might keep you from go
ing overboard and into the ocean
of debt. First, never charge
anyhting that you could easily pay
for with the good old green. Sec
ond, never charge anything that
you know that you, nor your par
ents can easliy pay off. For ex
ample, the book store can be
tempting because of it's enticing
array of clothing. It would probaly

be kosher to charge an occasional
item, but do not plan to do your
entire winter wardrobe shopping in
the bookstore's clothing depart
ment. Lastly, always think to your
self, "is this absolutley, and
complely neccessary?". If your
answer is a maybe, go home, think
about it, even discuss it with your
parents, and if you decide you still
want the item, come back the next
day. I can almost guarentee it will
still be there. Utilizing these tips
will definitly help to keep your
charge account down, and you and
your parents happy campers.

Pear New Roomate Needed,
This seems to be one of
those curve balls life tends to throw
at us. You think to yourself, "what
could b better than living with my
best friend?" Well, often a lot. In
being best friends you know a lot
about each others tendencies, and
some may even urk you, but be
fore this year you could retreat to

your room and she to hers if things
got sticky. Now this is no longer
the case. Most likely you and your
best friend do a lot of things
togehter, eat breakfast, go to some
of the same classes, eat lunch, go
to the same activities, eat dinner
together, ect. And then, after a long
period of togetherness, you go
home, well, together. This is a time
bomb just waiting to explode. Too
much togehterness cna lead to a lot
of aggravation and sometimes
heartache. You and your best
friend need to sit down and have a
heart to heart NOW. If the prob
lem persists, it will only get worse,
and could cause a serious hiatus in

the relationship.
You are concerned about
loosing her as a friend. Listen up.
Tell it to her straight, but not cru
elly. Say, "look roomie, I love you
dearly but your stepping on my
toes and it is starting to hurt." Lay
all the cards on the table and get
her feedback. You might be sur
prised by her reaction, YOU might
actually be driving her up a wall
as well. A true friend will be pa
tient, listen and respond in a way
that will probaly bring you two
closer. Lastly, have faith in your
friendship. Good friends are few
and far between, and sometimes in
order to get close to someone you
might actually have to move apart.

Women's tennis ends season second in conference

From Staff Reports
Junior Kate Goodall
and sophomore Bev Jack
son emerged as the leading
players on Gettysburg
College's 1997 women's
tennis team.
Gettysburg completed
the regular season with a
14-2 record and was 8-2 in
the Centennial Conference,
good for second place. The
Bullets were the defending
conference champs.
Goodall, playing out
of the number six singles
post most of the season,
recorded a 14-1 record.
Jackson, who handled the
number five spot through
out the season, was 14-2
for the year.

Goodall and Jackson
formed Gettysburg's top
number three doubles team
and were also the team
leaders in that area. They
posted a 13-1 record, the
second best in the Centen
nial Conference.
However, the season's
top honor went to the
Bullets' number two
singles player, senior
Cynthia Hoenes. Hoenes
not only made the All
Centennial Conference first

team, but was named
co-player of the year, along
with Johns Hopkins' Zeena
Abdi. Hoenes posted a 13
3 record.
Hoenes, one of only
two seniors on this year's
team, completes her colle
giate career with a stunning
54-13 singles record and a
48-10 doubles mark for an
overall 102-23 record.
Hoenes was joined by
junior Tara Schmitt to form
Gettysburg's number one
doubles team. They were
14-2 on the season and
were named to the all
conference first team.
They won their first seven
matches to end the season
with 14 wins.

Hoenes not only
proved to be a strong
competitor on the court, but
in the classroom as well.
She and senior Mary Joy
Troxel were named to the
Centennial Conference's
academic honor roll for
carrying a 3.40 GPA or
better.
Gettysburg completed

its sixth season under head
coach Bill Pfitzinger this
Spring. The Bullets are 66
21 under his guidance.

Forbes was named to
the All-District JJ team.
Forbes captured his second
straight Centennial Confer
ence championship and
completed the season with
935 strikes for 12 rounds

conference championships
he set three records: low
total per round, 72; low
first two rounds, 151; and
low gross, 224.
Forbes' closest com
petitor was sophomore
Matt Beckert, who carded
an 80.1 average on 801
strokes for ten rounds. He
was team medalist once
during the season.

Rounding out
Gettysburg's top five golfers

Strong starting lineup, Streeter's 20th make for promising season

FromStaf f Repor ts
Not only will
Gettysburg College be
launching its 105th football
season this year, but Head
Coach Barry Streeter will
begin his 20th year at the
Bullet helm. It all began
Monday when 93
candidates reported for the
first day of pre-season
drills. Streeter is currently
the college's all-time
coaching leader with 108
victories, 80 losses and five
draws. His best season was
1985 when he guided the
Bullets through their only
undefeated regular season

and eventually completed
the year with a 11-1-1 slate
following a semi-final
placing in the NCAA
Division III playoffs.
Streeter added three
new coaches to his staff of
eight. Steve Reider, a 1995
Dickinson graduate, and
Tom Waranavage, a 1993
Muhlenberg grad, have
been assigned to the wide
receivers and tight ends
respectively. The new
outside linebacker coach is
Marty Ogle, a 1974
graduate of Sheperd.
Among the 93
candidates Streeter will
greeted on Sunday were 49

freshmen and 44
upperclassmen, including
31 letter winners. Heading
the list is sophomore Paul
Smith. Smith, a first team
all-centennial conference
fullback as a freshman,
rushed 888 yards and
scored nine touchdowns in
1996. He has been named
on of USA III Football's
top sophomores to watch ii
1997. Leading the Bullets
in 1997 will be elected
captains Joe Hodakowski
and Rob Sena.
Hodakowski is a senior
linebakcer while Sena is a
senior defensive back.

The one nice thing
facing Streeter is the fact
that he has a solid starting
veteran at every position
except offensive left guard.
With an offensive line
intact, backed by an
experienced backfield, the
Bullets could unleash a
potent offense. Veterans
Chris Fugaro and Wes
Wells are back at
quarterback while veterans
Matt Helwig and Donny
McNellis will be at the
halfback slots. Joining
Smith at the fullback slot
will be another veteran,
Henry Unger, as well as the
return of Dan Sheats.

Sheats took a year off last
season for personal
reasons, after rushing for
273 yards and one
touchdown in five games as
a freshman in 1995.
The Bullets spent
the first two days going
through physicals,
equipmentadjustments,
testing and meetings. It has
been down to business ever
since with tow-a-day
sessions.
Gettysburg will
open its season on
Saturday, Sept. 13 at
Hampden-Sydney.

Football kicks off 105th season

Bullets sixth in Conference

LANCASTER, Pa.
-Can the dream continue in
Collegeville? Apparently
the coaches and SIDs in the
Conference think so.
Ursinus, which won
its first-ever Conference
football championship in
1996, is the favorite to
repeat as Centennial
Conference football
champion in a poll of the
Conference's head coaches
and media. Each head
coach and Sports
Information Director from
each Conference locale
participated in the poll.

The Bears received
eight of a possible 15 first
place votes (voters were
not permitted to vote for
their own team) for 81
points to outdistance
Franklin & Marshall, which
was second with 66 points.
Ursinus returns 15 starters
and 59 lettermen from last
season's 9-2 team which

was ousted in the NCAA
playoffs by Lycoming, 31
24. The Diplomats,
which finished second to
the Bears in the '96
standings, barely
outpointed Johns Hopkins
(64), Dickinson (63), and
Western Maryland (60), in
one of the closest preseason
ballotings in the
Conference's 15 year
history. F&M received
three first place votes,
while Western Maryland
picked up two. Johns
Hopkins and Dickinson
were on the top line in one
ballot apiece.
Gettysburg was
sixth with 49 points, while
Muhlenberg (22) and
Swathmore (15) rounded
out the field.
The Centennial
openers are set for Sept. 19
-20, when Gettysburg will
host Western Maryland.

tournament for the first
time since 1990 looked
very real.
Head Coach Hank
Janczyk's squad re
sponded by wining the
final five games of the
regular season, earning a
bid to the Division III

playoffs. In the first
round, Gettysburg
knocked off Salisbury
State in double overtime

10-9. The Bullets' season
came to a close when
they fell to Washington
in the semifinals, 10-9.
"Every once in a
while I guess you have a
season that demonstrates
how certain cliches get
started," said Janczyk,
who has now logged 10
seasons as the head
coach at Gettysburg. "I
probably used phrases
like 'keep believing' and
'never give up' more ¦
than I ever have before
as a coach. It must have

had some impact though_,
because by the time our
season ended, we had
worked our way into
being one of the top four
Division III teams in the
country."

The Bullets had
four seniors in their
starting lineup for the
two playoff games, three
of them at the midfield.
Brett Strait closed
out his four years at

the Bullets with 31 goals Gettysburg by scoring 26
