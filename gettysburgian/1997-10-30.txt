College wins
court battle

Haaland says tenure process
working well
A federal jury ruled in favor of Gettysburg College in
a discrimination lawsuit filed by a former professor who was
denied tenure.
Kelfala Kallon was a tenure-tack professor in
Gettysburg's economics department from 1987 until he was
denied tenure in the fall of 1992.
Kallon, a black man originally from Sierra Leone, was
unable to prove hisxlaims that he was denied tenure from
Gettysburg due to his race and national origin. He sought
back pay and compensatory damages.
Kallon, now a U. S. citizen, is currently a tenured
professor at the University of Northern Colorado.
Gettysburg College evaluates its professors for tenure
based on three separate criteria: teaching, research, and gov
ernance. Professors are evaluated for tenure by their aca
demic departments, the Faculty Personnel Committee, and
the President of the College.
College attorneys argued that Kallon was denied ten
ure because he failed to meet the College's standards for
teaching. He had received unsatisfactory evaluations from
students in his classes, which play a significant role in the
tenure process.

Kallon's attorneys claimed that Kallon had been de
nied tenure while white professors of similar ability were
approved for tenure. It was also suggested that the negative
evaluations given by the students may have been racially
motivated.
Much of the testimony in the week-long trial was cen
tered around the various intricacies of the College's tenure
process. Numerous documents were introduced as evidence
for the cases of both the defense and the prosecution.
Several Gettysburg College faculty members were
called to testify about the tenure process in general, and how
it related to Kallon.
Kallon himself spent nearly four hours on the witness
stand last Wednesday, in a very emotional testimony. Kallon
broke into tears many times while discussing the mental
anguish he suffered from the College's refusal to grant him
tenure. see RULING -- page 4

Olmos to show "We're all in the same gang"

Courtesy of The Fall Convocation
Committee Growing up in the East Los Ange
les barrio, barely escaping the violent vi
cious cycle of gang life, Edward James
Olmos went on to become a role model
to many people. He was able to achieve
this by succeeding on his own terms and
making his own choices. Olmos will be
the featured speaker at Fall Convocation
on November 13 at 11:30 a.m. in the
Chapel. Fall Convocation is a time to
arouse the intellect and challenge us to
reflect on both the realities of the world
as well as our own commitment towards
making a difference. Each year a presti
gious speaker is brought to Gettysburg
College to help raise our consciousness
of existing social issues.
Although he is most well known
for his role as Lt. Castillo on Miami Vice,
that is not his greatest accomplishment.
Olmos has dedicated years of his life try
ing to educate people. He is the ambassa
dor of UNICEF and sits on the board of

"Rebuild Los Angeles. " The unofficial
mayor of L.A., Olmos has worked to re
store the city's grief stricken neighborhoods
following the 1992 riots. He has also been
actively involved in bringing food to
Mexico's impoverished Mayan Indians.
Olmos is considered one of the
United States' most visible spokespersons
for the Hispanic Community. Mr. Olmos
comes to Gettysburg College advocating
education of the public in order to reduce
violence. With every word, he delivers the
message of self-discipline and determina
tion can overcome even the most daunting
obstacles. A number of programs will take
place leading up to Olmos' visit to
Gettysburg College, continuing into the
night of November 13 and in the days

CRIME STATS:

By Jason Hatheway

CORRECTION
Last week's article
"College sued for discrimina
tion" incorrectly reported that
the FPC recommended Pro
fessor Kallon for tenure when
in fact the Faculty Personnel
Committee decided against
granting Professor Kallon ten
ure. It was the Grievance
Committee of the Faculty, not
the President, who told Pro
fessor Charles "Buzz" Myers
to withdraw his grievance be
cause he had new information
to be considered in the grant
ing of tenure rather than a
grievance on procedural mat
ters. The Gettysburgian re
grets these unfortunate errors.

RULING — from p

The verdict in the case was
decided by the eight-member all
white jury ofthe U.S. Middle Dis
trict Court, despite the request of
College attorney Elizabeth
Dougherty to have Judge Sylvia
Rambo make the ruling due to lack
of evidence on the part of Kallon
and his attorneys.
The jury ruled in favor ofthe
defense, in apparent agreement with
Dougherty's suggestion that Kallon
was unable to show evidence that
any racial bias existed.
Stacey Schmeidel, Director
of Public Relations for the College
was pleased with the decision. "We
were confident from the beginning
that this had nothing to do with race
or national origin," she told the
Hanover Evening Sun.
Gettysburg College President
Gordon Haaland was also pleased
with the results of the case. He
stated that there was "absolutely no
problem," with the way the College
handles the tenure process. He
called the College's procedures in

evaluating professors for tenure
"clear and strong."
"This [decision] will rein
force, positively, the way we handle
the issue, and strengthen the role of
the Faculty Personnel Committee,"
said Haaiand.
Haaland also stated that he

felt the College's current method of
student evaluation was working,
though he acknowledged that "some
departments do a better job than oth
ers." Kallon still has the opportu
nity to appeal the decision.

Linnaean winners announced
from staff reports
The winners of the 1997-98 Linnaean Awards were announced
this Saturday during half-time at the Homecoming football game.
The Awards, given annually to six members ofthe graduat
ing class, were presented to seniors Erin Attfield, Jill Bailey, Ben
Barnhart, Joe Hodakowski, Abigail Rodgers, and Brian Rusignuolo.
Each year, students are nominated for the awards by faculty,
administrators, and other students for their leadership, academic work,
and community service. Students then vote for their peers among the
nominees.
The history of the Linnaean Awards dates back to one of the
earliest organizations on Gettysburg's campus, the Linnaean Asso
ciation, founded in 1844. The Association was founded for the pur
pose of the advancement of science. The Linnaean Awards attempt to
recapture the spirit of this organization by honoring students whose
actions inspire other students.

Featu res
zoinksh! G-G-G-GHOSTS!!!

by Cara Masucci
Staff Writer As Halloween approaches
every year, it seems as though
we all want to be scared. We
watch scary movies, tell fright
ening stories, and most of all,
talk about ghosts. Nowhere is
this more apparent than here in
Gettysburg College. Since it is
a very old, historic town,
Gettysburg has a rich tradition
of ghosts; our campus is no dif
ferent. When a tourist comes into
Gettysburg and stops you to ask
where the battlefields are lo
cated, your first instinct might be
to point in the direction of the
Visitor Center. If you were go
ing to be more precise, you'd tell
the tourist that they are standing
on them.

All of Gettysburg was a
battlefield during the Civil War,
so almost every inch of ground
has seen bloodshed or loss of
life. This has led to numerous
haunted buildings on campus.
At the time of the Civil
War, there were three buildings
on the campus of the college
then known as Pennsylvania
College. One of the buildings
was Penn Hall. Since it was a
large building , it was used as a
hospital for injured soldiers.
Many men died inside
Pennsylvania Hall, and there
were never enough doctors. In
fact, a few years ago several col
lege administrators were greeted
with a sight they knew they
would never forget.
Around dusk the adminis
trators decided it was time to go
home. They headed toward the
elevator and pushed the button
to get off on the first floor. They
were greeted with quite a shock
when they passed the first floor
and headed towards the base¬

ment. As the doors opened, leg
end has it that, they saw a Civil
War doctor who tried to get them

involved in the war effort. Quickly
pressing the button for the first
floor, they were beckoned more and
more. Just as the doctor was about
to reach the elevator door, the doors
closed and the administrators were
finally able to leave.
Another famous ghost is the
ghost of Glatfelter Hall. There are

all the way Stevens. The women
living there felt sorry for him and
decided to take him in. However,
the house mother heard stories of
this, and came up to the room on
the third floor to investigate.
Frantic, the girls let him out
side their window onto the ledge.

two different versions of what hap
pened to her, and what brought
about her leap from the y
belltower. /
One version of the /
story is that a woman /
was so distraught by / '
the loss of her fiance /
during the Spanish- / ' *
American War that / ' '" " '
she threw herself
off the hell tower to

an untim_^Jy death.
She now beckons
young women to
come jump with
her late at /
night. A
The fM

other most
told version of
the story is
that she and
her fiance
were not al
lowed to be
t o -
g*r _^_v
he- _kSfei

cause her father disapproved of the
match. They both decided to jump
together, but at the last minute, he
chickened out and she died without
him. In this version, it is the males
who are beckoned to jump with her.
It is a way of getting back at her
lover who refused to jump with her.
Another extremely famous
ghost story is that of the Blue Boy
of Stevens Hall. As one version of
the story goes, a young boy from
an orphanage ran away and made it

The house mother lectured them
for a long time, and as soon as they
were able, they opened the window
to let the small child in. However,
the boy was not there. They ran
down the stairs to look on the
ground beneath their window, fear
ful of finding his body there. But
there was nothing there. No body.
No print.
As legend goes, on cold,
wintery nights, girls in that room
have heard tapping at the window,

Looking up, she will see a blue
face at the window, and in the frost
are the words, "Help me."
Stevens is the oldest dorm
on campus. One ghost is not
nearly enough. There is another
ghost haunting the third floor of
the dorm. It is the ghost of a girl
who lived there once. More than
nnp. resident nf Stp.ve.ns has

opened the door to her
room onlv to _^ _-*

ly / / rent resident of
'/ / the room, she in
/ / variably runs to
/ the closet and hides
/ there. Upon open
/ ing the door, nothing

Another aca
demic building that is
haunted is Brua Hall,

home to the theater depart
ment. The ghost there
Vk is known as
_agBgg_^ The Gen
HHRI_^HM_^ e r a 1 ,
_g« _^.«« aBiK<B _«I»-- _Jhoygh j t _j S
iliiP > not known
whether the ghost was a real gen
eral at all. Theater students have
told of rehearsing on the stage of
Kline late at night, alone, look
ing up towards the light booth, and
seeing a figure dressed in Civil
War attire looking down at the
stage. Stevens, the lab theater, is
also quite haunted. As students
practice their one-act plays and
lunchtime shows, the lights have
often blinked on and off. even

though the cast is alone in the
building. Glancing up, the direc
tor will comment, "Oh, it must be
The General," and move on. First
time actors are a bit more shaken
up by the paranormal. With the
number of hours theater students
have to spend in the converted
church, they simply have learned
tn livp. with rp.siHp.nfs from another

time. Other well-known ghosts in
habit numerous fraternity houses
and dwellings along Carlisle
Street. These are the famous ghosts
of Gettysburg College. But since
the battle was everywhere, it only
makes sense that ghosts are every
where. One of the lesser known
ghosts on campus is the ghost of
Rice Hall.
Affectionately named
Daniel, he is known as a friendly
ghost. One day the resident of the
room decided she needed sleep.
Instead of getting up to pull down
the shades, she just decided to roll
over. When she woke up, the
shades were down, and her room
mate had not been there all after
noon. This could only be attrib
uted to Daniel .
He has been known to turn
off the girls' alarm clocks, and turn
on the television without any
prompting. Doors will fly open
when there is no wind, and one
unfortunate male stumbled across
him in the bathroom early one
morning while taking a shower.
Dressed in a Civil War uniform
with dark features, he drove the
guy right out of the bathroom.
Whether real of fake, ghosts
bring something to the campus. A
sense of history and connection
with that events occurred here over
one hundred years ago. As Hal
loween approaches this weekend,
these stories will intensify, and
brings lots of fun to many college
students. Who knows? Maybe
you'll come across one of the
ghosts of Gettysburg College.

In Case You Missed It
Mutant plant sings, dances, entertains

by Steve Spicer
Copy Editor Everyone needs a plant or
two in his room, but not one like
the Audrey II.
Being carnivorous, such a
"strange and interesting plant"
could never make it in a dorm
room, but place the overgrown
vegetable in the middle of a re
make of a remake and you've got
a surefire hit.
The story line behind Little
Shop of Horrors is an old one. It
was germinated in 1960 by Roger
Corman. Then it bloomed again
in 1980 and was made into an Off
Broadway musical.
However, the story didn't
come to full fruition until 1986

when Warner Brothers picked
up the script and handed it to
director Frank Oz.
No two versions of Little
Shop are quite the same. This
variant, the big screen transla
tion of a musical, is uproari
ously funny.
The reason this film is so
good is due to the phenomenal
cast that was gathered.
Rick Moranis
(Spaceballs, Honey, I Shrunk
the Kids ) plays Seymour
Krelborn, the poor, orphaned
misfit who lives in the basement
of Mushnik_'s Flower Shop
where he also works.
Ellen Greene reprises her
stage role of Audrey, Seymour's

love interest. Her high, squeaky
voice lends itself perfectly to her
ditziness.
Throughout the film, many
stars such as Bill Murray, John
Candy and James Belushi appear
in hysterical cameo roles.
The true star of Little Shop,
however, is the Audrey II. Levi
Stubbs, one of the original Four
Tops, lends his voice to the plant.
His vocal capacity, coupled with
a talented special effects team,
bring this "mean, green mother"
to life.
Another enjoyable aspect to
this movie is the music. From the
fast tempo of the title song to the
climactic moment of "Suddenly
Seymour," the songs amuse, and

move the audience.
The film opens with the om
nipresent do-wop girls, Crystal,
Chiffon and Ronette, singing a warn
ing to all.
The plot quickly advances to
Seymour and Audrey singing the
woes of life on Skid Row. The same
money troubles that keep Audrey
and Seymour trapped on Skid Row
also threaten to close Mushnik's
Flower Shop.
Seymour spends his time pin
ing away for Audrey as she dreams
of life in a suburbian home, com
plete with a white picket fence.
In an attempt to persuade the
owner, Mr. Mushnik, not to close the
store for good, Seymour places one
of his "strange and interesting"
plants, which he has named the
Audrey II, in the window.
Immediately, the customers
begin pouring in to gawk at the odd
ity.

As Seymour soon discovers,
though, there's a slight catch. His
cute little plant refuses to get big
ger. Seymour accidentally finds the
necessary food for his plant.
In order to grow, the Audrey
II requires an odd type of fertilizer:
blood. The vampire-vegetable's thirst
soon increases to the point where
Seymouris forced to "perform mu
tilations" in order to continue the
growth of both the plant and his
fame. The most memorable victim is
Audrey's boyfriend, Orin Scrivello,

D.D.S., the motorcycle-riding ,
leather-clad, sadistic dentist who
is portrayed perfectly by Steve
Martin {The Jerk, Parenthood).
Every scene containing
Martin is a must-see. As the char
acters in the movie say, he is a "to
tal disgrace to the dental profes
sion," After the Audrey II con
vinces Seymour that "the guy sure
looks like plant food to me,"
Seymour goes to Scrivello's office
expecting to have to kill him, but
instead the dentist overdoses on
nitrous oxide as Seymour looks on.
How convenient!

Apparently the good doctor
has a habit of getting lambasted
before any procedure he performs.
The Audrey II eats the now
defunct dentist but is still hungry.
Eventually, after the overgrown
squash devours a few more char
acters, Audrey II decides to snack
on its namesake, the real Audrey.
Since by this point Seymour
and Audrey (the woman, not the
plant) are planning on getting mar
ried and running off together,
Seymour has to confront the hor
ticultural nightmare to make a
clean escape.

I can't in good faith divulge
the shocking ending. If you want
to know what happens, you'll just
have to get this movie and see for
yourself.
I highly recommend this
flick for one of those goofy nights.

Brusque Brits

It his been an interesting
time to be in Britain. First of
course was the death of the Prin
cess of Wales; this contributed
greatly to the on-going saga of the
royal family. (Personally, I think
the Queen was in a lose-lose situ
ation: had she publicly expressed
grief, she would have been called
a hypocrite; by keeping silent, she
was called cold.)
Then there was the "yes"
votes on devolution; first in Scot
land, then in Wales. For Scotland,
this means a significant measure
of self-government free from
London. Wales will have some
what less freedom of action than
Scotland, but more than it had
before. Some believe this is the
final phase of the end of the Brit
ish Empire.

And there is the continuing
discussion of whether or not col
leges and universities in England
should remain free for all who at
tend. The Labour government has
proposed charging students and
students across the nation are up
in arms; there will be a demon
stration at the University of Essex
on November 1.
Imagine! The government
wants to charge $ 1,600 per year
to attend!! Some students may
even have to take out loans!! Per
haps you at Gettysburg would like
to stage a protest in support.
But the most striking im
pression I have of England is their
approach to customer service.
Though approach is not exactly
the right word; avoidance may be
a bit more accurate.

For example, we went into
a bakery and coffee shop in
Greenwich to buy some scones.
There were four clerks and two
waitresses behind the bakery
counter. We stood about three feet
away and waited; perhaps they
were resolving some problem.
We waited a little longer;
they continued their discussion.
Finally I said, "Could someone
please sell us some scones?" With
a look of annoyance, one of the
clerks did, without so much as a
"Thank you."
Another example: I went to
the Museum of the City of Lon
don late one afternoon and asked
to see the remnant of a gate and

guard tower from the Roman
walls. The museum building
straddles the site of the walls, so
you have to ask to be taken to a
large basement containing the rem
nant. The attendant told me,
"Sorry, it can only be seen one the
first and last Tuesday of every
month."
When I pointed out that it
was, in fact, the first Tuesday of
the month, he was crestfallen, but
he did summon a guard to take me.
While waiting, I apologized for
coming so late in the day (the Mu
seum was open another hour), and
he replied, "Actually, you can only
see it in the morning."
Too bad he had forgotten
Plan B until it was too late to stop
me.

Last example: We went to a
Victorian lunch room one day in
Dublin (to show that bad service
isn't merely an English trait), went
through the line, and went to the
cashier. At that moment, the cash
ier, second cashier, and what
looked like a manager were hav
ing an animated discussion.
We waited; perhaps they
were resolving some problem or
another. We waited a little longer.
Finally I shrugged my shoulders
and raised my hands palm up as if
to say, "So?" Whcn_^^^^_M
the manager final _ly_^^^^^^
looked over, I com-_^^^^^_f
mented, "We're what_^^^^^_f
is known as" custom-_^^H_^H
ers.'" The cashieil^^|^^
cheerfully said _. _HMIHHB

"Sorry," as the man
ager glared at me.
Now you might
say these could be
isolated examples,
and that you could
just as easily point to
similar experiences in
Gettysburg. I don't
think so. And don't
get me wrong, we're
having a great time.
The Brits are warm,
friendly people—as
long as they don't
have to wait on you.

Reel Hits & Misses—

Pucker up, Casanova

by Jon Froehlich
Staff Writer

critics might attempt to fit it in.
Much of the movie's suc
cess lies on the shoulders of Alex
Cross, played by Morgan Freeman
{Driving Miss Daisy, The
Shawshank Redemption). His
smooth but sharp manner that of
ten makes him so appealing to au
diences works well for him in this
role.

"He's a real student of the
game . . .And he loves to play."
said Alex Cross.
Forensic psychologist Alex
Cross is the kind of guy that has a
knack for knowing things about
people, almost before they know
it themselves.
The plot of Kiss the Girls
kicks in when that distance is shat
tered after a serial abductor call
ing himself Casanova makes the
game personal for Cross by tak
ing his niece, Naomi, played by
Gina Rivera (Soul Food).
Though audiences may
feel that this basic framework is
like that of a typical cop movie,
this assumption only rings true
to a certain extent.
For one, whether people
are quick to admit it or not,
movies about revenge bent cops/
tough guys out on personal mis
sions to catch the bad guy are usu
ally entertaining and offer plots
that have, and will continue to,
draw in eager viewers.

Movies such as Out for Jus
tice, starring Steven Seagal and
others like it will forever satisfy
many viewers on some level.
Secondly, Kiss the Girls is
a little bigger than the mold that

Tonight only partially
succeeds in being different, Kiss
the Girls must be given credit for
trying to break away from many
of the cliches that aren't so easily
avoided when making a police
mystery movie.
For example, Casanova
took Cross's niece. Director Gary
Fleder (Things To Do in Denver
When You're Dead) could have
just as easily given into tempta
tion and made Cross's daughter
disappear, but he didn't.

Though simply a difference
of one branch on the Cross family
tree, this decision nevertheless
shows a deviation from the nor
mal cop movie blueprint.
As Kiss the Girls takes on
a personal tone for Cross, it soon
becomes as personal as is possible
with its viewers when Casanova
grabs Kate McTeirnan.
Played well by Ashley Judd
(Smoke, A Time to Kill, Sisters),
Kate is one of the only characters
besides Cross that the movie has
allowed audiences to really
"know."
I In the character of Kate,
Judd offers a defiant and on-tar
get performance that audiences
can easily appreciate.
A movie with many of the
same shadowy qualities as Seven
(which also stars Morgan Free
man), Kiss the Girls, though noth
ing strikingly new, offers an ex
citing well-paced plot with char
acters that seem deeply connected
to the story and to each other.

Concluding with a battle
between two men who have made
their lives out of getting into other
people's heads, Kiss the Girls will
not leave viewers disappointed.

Go speed racer... But keep it clean

by Kyle Heulitt
GECO Columnist
The car industry has been
pressured for years to produce
cleaner automobiles. Each com
pany has been working intensely
to be the first to find the perfect
fuel-efficient, pollution-free car of
the future, and the public is just re
cently beginning to see the fruits
of their labor.
The week Honda unveiled its
lower-emission vehicle, which has
a device in the exhaust system that
changes pollutants into less toxic
substances like water and carbon
dioxide.
This car reduces noxious
emissions to one-tenth the level of
the world's toughest emissions
standard set by the California Air
Resources Board. The new engine
could be in production in less than
two years.

Although Honda s new ve
hicles seem to be the most practi
cal and soon to be available right
now, the most promising technolo
gies for the future seem to be the
fuel cell, the electric car, and the
hybrid.
The fuel cell is able to power
electric cars without the need for
bulky batteries. It converts the
chemical energy of fuels into elec
tric and thermal energy, and the

only exhaust it produces is pure
water and a small amount of heat.
This car is able to run on
ethanol, methanol, natural gas,
and recently, a U.S. government
industry team demonstrated one
that can use gasoline.
Each of these fuels could

easily
r e -
place
gaso
line at
t h e
pumps and keep the ex
isting
net
works of gas
sta
tions intact.
I n

May 1996, in Berlin, Germany's
Daimler-Benz AG unveiled the
NECAR 3, and became the first
major international car maker to
unveil a fuel cell powered pas
senger car. This particular car
runs on methanol.
Another type of car that
will be utilized in the future is the

electric car. In the past these cars
were small and inconvenient, but
car makers are finding new ways
to bring them up to the level of
today's gasoline cars.
Toyota's RAV4-EV, an elec
tric sports utility vehicle, will re
tail this fall (exclusively to busi¬

nesses)
for about $42,000.
It has a
range _0 f
about 1 3 0
miles before r e -
charge is nec
essary.
R e -
charg
i n g

takes 8
hours and can be done from a 220
volt electric line. Its maximum
speed is electronically limited to 78
miles per hour.
One more type of promising
technology is the hybrid vehicle,
which has both an electric and
gasoline engine. It has the advan
tages of the gasoline engine with

none of the disadvantages of elec
tric cars.
The hybrid engine has an
automatic power-split device in
the transmission that allows it to
use an electric motor in low speed
driving, and cut to a gas engine for
higher speeds, supplying extra en
ergy and recharging the batteries.
Also, the gas engine never
idles, which is where the most en
ergy is wasted. Instead, the en
gine remains off until extra power
is needed.
Toyota plans to retail its hy
brid, named the Prius, in Japan
starting on December 10, for
about $22,000. GM, Ford,
Chrysler, Volkswagen, and
Renault are also pursuing hybrid
cars. In Kyoto, Japan, on Decem
ber 1, there will be a meeting of
representatives of governments
from around the world to discuss
the threat of global warming.

This meeting will undoubt
edly force the auto industry to be
come environmentally friendly,
and put earth-friendly cars on the
market. Hopefully we will see
these cars for sale in a few years.
GECO meets every Thurs
day at 7 p.m. at the GECO office
in the basement of Plank Gym. All
are welcome!!!

Sour
Apple?

by Casey Dunn
Staff Writer

Fiona Apple is a name that
is becoming more and more
prominent, especially here at
Gettysburg College.
As I began to listen to her
album, I was expecting something
spectacular in her music. What I
found was a talented musician, but
one much like everyone else.
Her debut album, Tidal, was
written by Apple. At age 19,
younger than half the student
population here on campus, she
had become a prominent figure in
the music industry, and I assumed
it was because of earth shattering
music. After listening to her CD I
realized I was wrong.
Her music resembles much
of what is popular today, espe
cially in the female music indus
try. She is similar to many of her
contemporaries in the style of
music she plays and in the image
she portrays: an image of an "or
dinary" girl making a name for
herself in a male dominated world
and industry.

Her faster songs, with a lot
of guitar, are a shade less bitter
than Alanis Morrisette and sound
almost identical to that Joan
Osborne. Other songs reminded
me of Jewel.
My favorite songs on the
CD were the ones accompanied by
piano, sounding almost like Tori
Amos, but with a lot less flare and
emotion. The song
"Shadowboxer" was by far my
favorite, with its piano-in-a-small
bar-on-the-corner type feel. In my
opinion, this particular song was
the most unique and revealed a lot
of her talent.
I found the CD to be one that
was enjoyable to listen to, and
even found myself humming
along to some of the tunes. She
does display a tremendous amount
of talent, but her music did not
seem groundbreaking to me.

I began to wonder what
makes her so popular, and decided
it is the image she portrays as a
young female. Her image gives
hope to those who aspire to "make
it" in the music industry. In es
sence she is the icon of possibil
ity.

Dear Casey...

Dear Casey,
I am rather bummed be
cause my parents took my car
away and are letting my brother
have it at his campus. This has
forced me to give up my off-cam
pus job and limited my mobil
ity. There is no way I can get a
car by myself, and I am rather
bitter about this loss. Is there
anything I can do?
Carless
Dear Carless,
It does seem rather unfair
that you lost your car to your
brother, but it is probable that your
parents had their reasons. I would
not attempt to squander your
money on buying a lemon. Instead
I would attempt to make lemon
ade. Seeing as the campus and
town is not too expansive, it
should be relatively easy for you
to get around without wheels, and
enjoy the scenery as well.

As for your job, try getting
one on campus, it will most likely
save you lots of time and energy
you could be using in other con
structive activities.
In general, I would like you
to know that the loss of a car is
not the end of the world and that
you are just going to have to learn
to get about without it.
There could be many more
terrible things that could happen,

Howard in Gettysburg by Myles Price

and even though the situation is a
real bummer, things could be
worse.
And, if just sitting back and
accepting things is not your style,
try constructively convincing your
parents that you need the car. Do
not try to use guilt trips and the
such, because they usually do not
hold water with parents.
Perhaps, if you can defend
the argument that you need the car
more than your sibling, you might
be able to retrieve it. If not, try

not to hold a grudge, or you might
be carless for a much longer time.
Dear Casey,
Just recently I found out
that people who I thought were
my "friends" were talking about
me behind my back. I acci
dently overheard a conversation
in which they were complaining
about me. They don't know
that I overheard them and still
treat me like a friend. I cannot
believe that my "friends" would
be so two-faced. What should I
do?

Feeling Friendless
Dear Feeling Friendless,
This seems to be a sticky
situation, but my best advice is to
stand up for yourself and do not
let your friends walk over you like
an old throw rug.
The last thing anyone needs

are shallow friends who just keep
you around to complain about you.
It is sad, but true. Perhaps over
hearing their conversation can be
seen as a good thing, because now
you know where you really stand.
You should definitely let
them know that you heard what
they said, and do not let them try
to apologize or explain their way
out of it. Let them know how you
feel and leave it at that.
It is really self-defeating if
you keep friends around who are
two-faced. You can certainly do
better than them. True friends do
not maliciously rag on their
friends to others, even though
sometimes friendship ties can be
strained.
Do not allow yourself to be
treated with anything less than re
spect. This is often hard to do, es
pecially in this age of exploitation
and the such where everyone
thinks they can walk over anyone
they want.

You re at an awkward point
in life. You want to feel popular;
nobody wants to sit in Servo alone.
But this doesn't mean you should
sacrifice your self-respect. Your
"friends" are the jerks here, not
you. You need to remember that.
So I say, stand up and de
fend yourself. After you do, move
on and do not dwell on them any
longer. After all, are they really
worth your time and energy?

Random Thoughts by Sara Spren/qe

by John Dunlap
Staff Writer Last Sunday's victory by the
Florida Marlins in the World Se
ries was very representative of the
changes effecting Major League
Baseball today. America's national
pastime is undergoing a process of
historic change. Change, that in
my opinion, is dragging the entire
sport down from the big leagues
to the little leagues.
It could easily be said that
baseball is a business, and as an
ideological conservative I should
allow the sport adapt to the chang
ing times. In other words, the own
ers and the players should be left
to handle matters on their own. For
the most part, they should be al
lowed, however there are some
cases when government should
step in and protect the national in
terest.

In 1981, when Harley
Davidson was near death because
of Japanese competition, President
Ronald Reagan stepped in and
moved away from his devout free
trade positions to support tariffs to
save America's great motorcycle.
This was not exactly a capitalist
position having the government
come in and influence the buying
and selling of goods, but it was the
right thing to do. Certain traditions
are timeless and should never be
allowed to either die or face rapid
demise. Baseball today is under-

There are too many cars here
at Gettysburg. Not only are there
too many cars, but there is always
one in my space.
The parking problem is
worst in the lots in College Apart
ments, Paxton Hall, and Huber/
Patrick/_Musselman/Stevens Halls.
The people who live in these
dormitories and apartments should

going a great deal of demise. What
acting Commissioner Bud Selig,
club owners, and the player's
unions are doing is wrong. Fore
most wrong for fan.
Under Mr. Selig's acting
leadership, and that is all it is, and
his predecessor, Fay Vincent's tra
ditions which have lasted for al
most a century are being broken.
Some traditions are meant to be de
stroyed like Jackie Robinson's his
toric breaking of the color barrier
fifty years ago but some traditions
should remain timeless. Baseball
can not cater to primetime enter
tainment interests by having the
New York Yankees and Mets play
one another because it could be a
great promotional game. One is in
the American League and one in
the National League. Baseball is
the only sport where after the pre
season you do not see your possible
World Series opponent until the
World Series itself. That is now
being changed.

In the early part of this de
cade, Mr. Vincent realigned the
Leagues and then it was done again
to create an extra level of playoffs,
to have wildcard team and have the
playoff hunt go longer. That may
mean more money but it destroys
traditions, it cheapens the game.
Less and less children are playing
Little League and that spells
trouble down the road for baseball.
With less talent what will baseball

get first priority. For example,
there are off-campus dwelling stu
dents who still have their Gettys
burg College parking sticker and
park in College Apartments, com
pletely ticket-free.
You don't practice hula
dancing. You either can or you
can't. I have a feeling you can, but
Dan says you can't.

then have to do, go to aluminum
bats because people are too bored
to watch a pitchers' duel.
The sport of baseball is a
mind game and, maybe, by mov
ing a team to a suburb and having
more horneruns will be able to at
tract a larger baseball illiterate
crowd. However, by doing that you
forget about the people who love
baseball for what it is, a sport that
has no shot clocks and no timeouts,
a sport where you have to be think
ing about every pitch, every run
ner and every possible pitcher to
hitter match up.
This most recent World Se
ries was representative of the fu
ture over how a five year old ball

club could be pieced together with
86 million dollars worth of play
ers to win a World Series. Now
that they have won that champion
ship they will probably be sold and
the players be traded off to save
money. What ever happened to the
teams who drafted a player and
watched him become a star like
Mike Schmidt of the Philadelphia
Phillies or Cal Ripken Jr. of the
Baltimore Orioles. Ripken was
born and raised in suburban Balti
more, as a kid he cheered for the
Orioles, now day after day he is
on the field playing for that team.
It would never happen, but free
agency should be done away with.
It has made the game one of the
dollar. Some players have resisted

There shouldn't be restric
tions on visiting friends in these
domiciles, but a policy similar to
the one in Masters parking lot
would be useful. Between 2 and 6
am, only residents of the appropri
ate dormitories should be allowed
to park in the lot. This would prac
tically guarantee the dorm deni
zens a parking spot right outside

but most do not, and maybe they
cannot be blamed. Free Agency
is forcing the American and Na
tional Leagues two central divi
sions to be the mediocre divisions
where players are raised so that the
East and West Coast can buy them
away. The Cleveland Indians over
came that and without Albert Bell,
who was bought away buy the
highest bidder, this year they came
within one run of winning the
World Series.
Granted perhaps what I want
can never occur, the chances of
going back are virtually nonexist
ent. If I could go back I would
have never wanted baseball to ex
pand into Canada with the
Montreal Expos and the Toronto
Blue Jays. Nothing against
Canada but the USA's sport should
not extend outside of our great bor
ders

In my dream world we
would have no designated hitter,
and the job of an American League
Manager would be as tough as the
job of a National League Manager
We could also put Pete Rose in the
Baseball Hall of Fame where he
belongs. It is wrong that the all
time hit king and the greatest util
ity player in the history of the game
is not in Cooperstown with the
other greats of baseball. Lastly, we
could have Jim Leyland win a
World Series with a team who de
served to win it but could not com-

the door instead of a long walk
away. Won't somebody please
think of the children?
If black boxes are always
inspected after plane crashes, why
isn't the entire plane made out of
the black box material?
One of the best things about
baseball is that we agree to dis¬

r
rates

pete financially, the Pittsburgh Pi
. Baseball needs a Commis
sioner who understands tradition
and the history of the sport'. Some
one who will fight to keep the
teams where they are. Baseball
should not be like the NFL where
the New York Giants and Jets play
in New Jersey. The New York Yan
kees should stay in New York, pref
erably in the Bronx. Baseball
needs someone who appreciates
history and traditions, the kind of
history of tradition that can be felt
by going into the Baseball Hall'of
Fame and visiting Doubleday Field
in Cooperstown, New York.
Baseball's old Leagues can not be
allowed to devolve into the East

and the West like the NBA. The
Milwaukee Brewers should stay in
the American League.
President Clinton wanted to
takeover our national health-care

put baseball back on track, like
President Reagan did with Harley
Davidson, then for once govern

through legislation or executive
orders but by sitting down with all
sides and represent the silent ma

If not, there goes another great

Public Relations Chairs - Panhel
andlFC We hope that every one en
joyed a very festive and safe
Homecoming weekend. It was
great to see our alumni again and
to root our football team on to a
fantastic victory. We also want
to congratulate the winners of this
years Linean award: Abby
Rodgers, Jill Bailey, Erin Attfield,
Ben Barnhart, Joe Hodakowski
and Brian Rusignuolo. We also
want to take this time to remind
everyone that half of this years
winners were members of Greek
organizations on campus. Abby
is a Delta Gamma, Jill is a
Gamma Phi Beta, and Brian is a
Theta Chi. Great job on repre
senting the Greek community,
maybe next year all six winners
will be Greek!

This past weekend, the
Alumni Greek Council (AGC)
met for their annual fall meeting
at Theta Chi. The AGC is the
governing body of the Greek
Alumni corporations. Some of
the topics discussed were rush,
academic performance, and of
course the BYOB policy. The
next meeting is scheduled for

Thank you! Our best estimate is that there were 200
children trick-or-treating. Your kindness and sharing made
it a wonderful and profitable event for all those children. We
hope you enjoyed the experience as much as they did.
Incidentally, a point of interest for those of you won
dering how the trick-or-treating fits into Latino tradition, on
Tuesday night you facilitated the creation of hundreds of
pinatas all over Adams County. Gracias!

Just a couple of reminders,
First Year guys, your rush booklet
containing information on each
fraternity should be in your mail
boxes by the end of next week.
Secondly, Lambda Chi is continu

American Food Drive (NAFD).
They will be collecting non-perish
able foods and any donations until
November 1, so be sure to contrib
ute in some way. For more details
contact Bill Burns at x8358.
Just a reminder to all soror
ity and first year women, there will
be a picnic in the CUB Ballroom
on Wed. October 29. It will begin
at 6:00. This is a perfect opportu
nity to come and meet new people.
Many thanks are in order to
all faculty and students who helped
support National Breast Cancer
Awareness Month. Our efforts
raised $1,050 for the cause.

Another thanks are in order
to all those who helped support
Survivors and the toilettrie drive.
All the donations will be put to
good use by the battered women's

Editor's Note:
Dr. KermitFinstad's let
ter "Voice IS and instrument,"
was printed with an erroneous
spelling of Jonathan Blake's
name. The Gettysburgian re
grets the error.

Consider this...

According to President
Haaland, the tenure process here
at Gettysburg works.
He seems to view the
school's victory in the discrimi
nation case earlier this week as a
victory for the system currently
in place.
Many disgruntled students
would disagree as they watch their
favorite professors search for new
jobs at different schools and the
respective departments bring in
candidates to replace what
shouldn't be replaced.
Was Professor Kelfala
Kallon denied tenure because of
his race and national origin, as he
claims?
Or is he, as the College
would suggest, merely a dis
gruntled former faculty member,
blaming Gettysburg for his own
shortcomings?

While the court ruling may
serve as a legal vindication of the
College's point of view, the com
plexities of the tenure process are
such that it is nearly impossible
to resolve the question.
While President Haaland
may be justified in his belief that
the College's actions in the Kallon
case were not racially motivated,
his refusal to acknowledge the
glaring problems in the manner in
which the college handles the ten
ure process is not acceptable.
Stop and think about it: can
you clearly describe the tenure

There is no clear policy, no

Perhaps this lawsuit will
serve as enough of a motivation
to prompt the administration to
implement a campus-wide set of
standards to dictate the require
ments for tenure.
Such a policy would not
only Jimit the disparities of req
uisites for tenure between each
individual department, but would
also aid both the candidate and the
Faculty Personnel Committee

A policy such as this would
not only simplify the tenuring
process, but also provide a mea

College. If there existed a list of
requirements, the question of why
any candidate was refused tenure
could be quickly and easily dis
cerned.
Enough of the policies and
regulations of the College are
wrapped up in bureaucracy, the
process of insuring lifetime em
ployment should be clear and
concise. Such simplicity would
benefit all those involved ~ pro
fessors, students, and the College
itself.

Smoke 'em if you got 'em

by I.A. Isherwood
Staff Writer As of recent, I have learned
much from a class modestly (yet
accurately) entitled Colonial
American history.
As an assistant tobacconist
for a local Pittsburgh shop I have
an interest in tobacco, that blessed
plant which causes the smoker so
much pleasure, and the leftist non
smokers so much disdain. Still
though, I have become increas
ingly more annoyed at the audac
ity of our campus community in
their attitude toward the tobacco
leaf. It seems that this issue has
gone beyond just an administrative
problem, but one which might ac
tually stem from the student non
smokers in their emphatic tobacco
witch hunt.

At least once a week I am
confronted by non-smoking
Clintonites who tell me that I
should not smoke because it will
harm me in the future. I view such
comments as an insult to my (and
other smoker's) intelligence.
SMOKING KILLS! There
isn't one person on this campus
who smokes and does not know the
obvious risks of such an activity.
I do not need to be told
everytime I engage in one of my
central pleasure activities that I
might die. Now, I thank you all
for caring so much about my
health, but you need not con
sciously annoy me (and others) On
a weekly basis. I think I can edu
cate myself on such an issue.
Smoking has been a funda
mental part of American history

since the beginnings of permanent
colonization in North America.
Settlers would have long aban
doned Jamestown if not for the sot
weed (or tobacco plant).
America was built upon a
leaf, and Americans have enjoyed
such a leaf since the foundations
of our society. To quote my pro
fessor of colonial history "even the
Puritans smoked," and, truly, they
did. They loved their pipes and so
do I and many other Americans
some of whom are students at Get
tysburg College.
We need not threaten smok
ers, we need not attack them, and
we need not spit upon their leaf
like it was the most vile substance
known to man.
Oh, I have some news for
people, alcohol: in great amounts,

can kill you! Add to that, movie
theater popcorn, bacon, and
burgers which can kill you, you
don't see me walking up to some
guy at the counter of LD's and say
ing "Hey buddy, put down that
pork cause in twenty years it might
kill you." Neither should people
pester others because of their pre
ferred mode of death.
Now I am not advocating
everyone to light up or to purposely
inconvenience others by smoking.
No, With smoking comes the re
sponsibility of the smoker to be
courteous to those who do not en
joy the smell of smoke. If others,
in the past, had been responsible
with their smoking, then maybe we
would not see such an avid and stu
pid anti-smoker campaign.
I began to smoke because I

enjoyed tobacco, and I enjoyed it
so much I chose it for my part-time
college employment. It is a fasci
nating industry and honestly some
thing that many people out there
enjoy. There is nothing like hav
ing a good tobacco in a pipe, or a
nice Habana cigar. Those who pre
fer cigarettes can find so much en
joyment in a smoke after an exam
or a meal.
To the conscious smoker, to
bacco is a delightful plant for those
whom it appeals. I am one of those
people, and there is nothing wrong
with my smoking. If one wants
to smoke, and knows the eventual
ramifications of such behavior,
then let him for it is his life and
his right to do so.
We are all adults and we
need not insult each other by treat
ing smokers like children.

At least 15 million
Americans already
have the virus that
causes them.

Human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that
causes genital warts, is the most common sexually
transmitted disease in the United States today.
In fact, an average of 750,000 new cases of genital
warts are diagnosed each year. And it's estimated
that 11 million people who have the virus that
causes genital warts don't even know it.
Genital warts are not always obvious. They can
be small or large and appear alone or in clusters
outside or inside the body. Many genital warts
can only be found by a healthcare provider.
It's still not possible to cure HPV But, by getting
rid of the warts, healthcare providers hope to get
the virus under control. There are many types of
HPV infections, some causing external warts and
others affecting the cervix. It is important for
women to see their healthcare providers regularly
for pelvic exams and Pap smears. And, because
men and women can pass the virus to sex partners,
they should see a healthcare provider whenever
genital warts or HPV are suspected.

Genital warts don t just happen to other people.
If you notice any unusual bumps or growths in
the genital area, or if your partner has had genital
warts or HPV, see your healthcare provider.

Dr Jerzy Wojciechowski, Depart

University, "Rearrangements of
Infinite Series" - Suppose that
al+a2+. is a convergent infinite
series It is well known that if the
series is not absolutely convergent,
then by rearranging the terms of the
series, we can make it converge to an
arbitrarily chosen real number
During the talk we will look at the
question of rearrangement of series
from a different angle Suppose that a
permutation of positive integers is
given. We can ask then, for example
is there an infinite series with sum 0
such that using the given permuta
tion to rearrange its terms we get a
series convergent to 1? A result
giving a complete answer to ques
tions of this type has been recently
proved by C. St J A Nash-Williams
and D J. White The proof is based on
a theorem about network flows All
students and faculty are invited.

Women's Soccer attempts to rebound

by Kevin Romano
Contributing writer

ter eluding charging goalie Beth
O'Boyle.
Again the Lady Bullets
came back. Freshman midfielder
Jill Piekarski finalized a furious
flury in front of the Haverford goal
when she scored with around 34
minutes to go. The score tied the
game at 2-2.

The Lady Bullets women's
soccer team lost 3-2 to Centeniel
Conference challenger Haverford
College on Saturday, October
18th, at home. The loss was
Gettysburg's second in a row fol
lowing a 12 game winning streak.
With leading scorer Amy
Brewster sidelined with leg inju
ries and senior playmaker Paula
Connard playing on a sore
achillies tendon the Bullets came
out flat and fell behind 1 -0 at half
time. Less than a minute into the
second half Bullet sophomore
Lauren Morrell scored her first
collegiate goal and energized the
Lady Bullets. But the momentum
turned Haverford's way once
again with 38 minutes to play
when a Fords' attacker got behind
the Bullets' defense and scored af-

Thetie
and the
game were
lost a few
minutes later
when Haverford scored on a
cross from
the left side
of the box.
The 3-2 loss

was the Bul
lets' first against a conference foe.
Gettysburg outshot the Fords 18
5 on Saturday but were unable to
capitalize on their efforts.
Over the College's reading

days long weekend the Lady Bul
lets lost 1-0 to Carnegie-Mellon
University in Pittsburgh. Playing
on astroturf for the first time this
season the Bullets dominated the
game but were unable to find the
back of the net.
Assistant Coach Jamie

Wilhite said the
game came down to
a difference in
styles. "They
played long ball,
that's not us. We
played to their
level." The Bullets
dropped to 12-3
with the losses but
are ranked fifteenth
nationally in Divi
sion III. Said

Wilhite of the losses, "We like to
play a very disciplined and struc
tured system. But the last two
games we haven't."
On Saturday the Bullets will

try to end their slide when they
meet Notre Dame of Maryland at
12:30 at home. Then on Tuesday
Gettysburg takes on conference
co-leader Johns Hopkins on the
road in a game that figures to de
cide the conference champion
ship. "From here on out we're go
ing to have to take it one game at
a time," said Wilhite.
Other Notes: The girls soc
cer team was dissapointed Tues
day in their Centennial Confer
ence Championship at Johns
Hopkins. The Bullets lost 2-0, on
a the harsh artificial turf of the
Bluejays home field. The Bullet's
next game is against the College
of New Jersey. New Jersey's
women's soccer team is 50-1 in the
last four years. Pretty dominant.
They come into the game as the
number one team in the country,
but, you will never guess who their
last lost was to... Gettysburg.

Wrestlers begin with hopes of great season

Josh Eyler
Assistant Sports Editor
The air is begining to get
colder and colder. On a walk
through campus you can observe
many of the fall sports teams
winding-down as their last few
contests approach. Then, continue
your walk and travel down to
Bream-Wright-Hauser. You can't
help but notice that joining the vol
leyball team in the gymnasium are
the men's and women's basketball
teams. You sigh with content.
Winter sports are here.
The screaming crowds and
the rocking gyms will soon be

upon us. But as soon as you think
that, you realize that you are leav
ing something out. You walk up
the steps to the second floor of the
complex still wondering. You
walk right past it.
What, you might ask? What
am I walking by? Why the third
floor of Bream-Wright, of course.
I bet you didn't even know that
there was a third floor. It is not
very big, but on the third floor
there is a place where dreams are
realized, bones are broken, and
victories are won. You see, the
wrestling room is on the third
floor.

Very few people know what
goes on in that room and it is dif
ficult to explain as well. Suffice
to say that the wrestlers in that
room go through things that take
them to the thresholds of both their
minds and bodies.

The guys that go through
this share a unique bond of friend
ship. Day in and day out they
share the pain of injuries, the fa
tigue of constant conditioning, and
a third variable that is unique to
the sport. Food.
Many of the wrestlers sim
ply can't have food or much of it..
The diet of a wrestler who is los¬

ing weight is such that he is al
ways hungry and thirsty before
practice even starts. Many have
to lose approximately 10 pounds
per week of matches.
It is not a pleasant feeling
by any stretch of the imagination.
However, the feeling of stepping
on the mat during a match and
winning, whether by a point or a

pin, makes up for all of the other
aspects of the sport.
This year the Bullet wres
tling team has to adjust to a new
coach. Over the summer, Dave
Wilson, the coach of the program
for the last eight years, took a job
opportunity in Connecticut.
The new coach for the team
is Troy Dell, an alumnus from

1995. The captains of the team
have remained the same as last
year: Jake Dell, Chris Clifford,
and Brad McCutcheon. Their first
match is November 8 at home and
they would enjoy the support of
all the fans as they go for the Cen
tennial Conference Champion
ship.

Brewster making strong comeback for women's soccer squad

by Scott Grabus
Contributing Writer / B.A.S.S
member B.A.S.S. Profile
Name: Amy Brewster
Age: 20
Hometown: Trumbull, CT
Sport: Women's Soccer
Major: Psychology
Year of Graduation: 1999
Hobbies/Interests: Any
athletic activity
Our women's soccer team is
currently 13-3 and most likely on
its way to the post-season with just
a few more wins. Many players
contributed to the Lady Bullets'

success, but one player who stands
out is junior forward, Amy
Brewster. Due to her determina
tion, Amy has made an unlikely
comeback to the women's soccer
team. Brewster, who started as a
freshman, was a key scorer for the
Bullets with 8 goals. Unfortu
nately, she went down at mid-sea
son with an injury. While on a
breakaway to score yet another
goal, Amy was slide-tackled from
behind, and tore tendons in her
ankle. Not only did she miss the
rest her freshman season, but due
to surgery and rehabilitation she
missed her entire sophomore sea
son.

"It was really tough not
playing," says Amy talking about
the sport she's been playing since
first grade. This extended
offseason taught her to take ad
vantage of the time she has left to
play soccer.
The injury has also served
to be a great motivator for her.
Brewster already has 11 goals for
the team this year. She hopes to
be a key component in leading the
Lady Bullets on to the playoffs.
It has been a great year for
the women's soccer team and Amy
says, "It's great to be back again."
Good luck to Amy and the rest of
the Lady Bullets soccer team.

Amy Brewster has returned to the lineup to be a strong player

Bullets slap Mules silly with offensive barrage

The dominating running of Paul Smith and Matt Helwig punished Muhlenberg for 44 points

By Peter Huminski
Staff Writer It was a record setting after
noon Saturday in Musselman Sta
dium when the Gettysburg Bullets
bowled over the Muhlenberg
Mules 44-32.
In front of a Homecoming
crowd of 1,384, sophomore run
ning back Paul Smith exploded for
a Centennial Conference record of
373 all-purpose yards. Smith also
tied a school record of five touch
downs in a single game.
After three slow weeks of
fensively, the Bullets (3-4, 2-3 in
Centenial Conference) came back
to life, gaining 547 total yards.
"Our kids played hard against a
team that we think is a good well
coached hustling football team,"
said Bullets coach Barry Streeter.
"I was excited about the way we
ran the ball, but I think our pass
ing game kept them off-balance."

Going into the game, the
Bullets offensive line had been a
little banged up. With junior
tackle Pete Scaffidi sidelined with
an injury, Bullets relied on fresh
man Jack Starkey to fill the gap
and protect quarterback Dennis
Flaherty's blind side.
The rest of the offensive line
remained intact however with se
nior Kurt Ritter anchoring the cen
ter position, senior Bryan Willard,
and junior Justin Orgorek at the
guards, and sophomore Bill
Beining at the other tackle spot.
This five-some played an excellent

game and opened up the game of
fensively for the Bullets.
The offensive line allowed
the Bullets to rush for 391 yards
on 46 carries. Smith rushed for
220 yards on 15 carries, while
backfield mate Matt Helwig
rushed for 134 yards on 15 car
ries. Smith had touchdown runs
of 2, 7, 52, and 80 yards.
"The offensive line had
holes that you could drive a truck
through," said Smith. "It was
beautiful. I made the cuts I'm told
to make, and anticipated the
blocks that were supposed to be
there and I was gone."
The Bullets passing game
was also revitalized against the
Mules. Flaherty used a solid mix
of poise, confidence, and a strong
arm to pick apart the Mules sec
ondary. Flaherty completed 8 of
11 passes for 156 yards and one
touchdown. The touchdown came
on an 87 yard pass to Jeff Closz
on the Bullets first drive of the
game. Flaherty also added a 1
yard touchdown run.
"He's (Flaherty) young.
He's just learning stuff, but I
thought he did a nice job today
(Saturday)," said Streeter. "He put
the ball where it belonged and
made some good calls at the line
of scrimmage, and ran the option
pretty well."
Closz finished the game
with three catches for 123 yards
including the touchdown. John
Capaldi also had three catches for
26 yards. Capaldi's catches came

on several key third down situa
tions that kept Bullet drives alive.
The Bullets bend but never
break defense also had several big
plays. After Wayne Rumsey's
opening kickoff sailed into the end
zone the Mules inarched 75 yards
down the field to the Bullet 5-yard
line. This was as far as the Bul
lets' defense would allow them.
On third and one
Muhlenberg's Mike Martino was
met by nose tackle Greg Gudis for
no gain. On fourth down and one
Martino was met by defensive
tackle John Meier for another no
gain. This defensive stand gave
the Bullets the ball.
The Bullets then marched
95 yards in two minutes to score
on Flaherty's 87 yard pass to
Closz. This staked the Bullets to
a 7-0 lead. The Bullets led 19-6
at halftime.
In the second half the Bul
lets used several big plays offen
sively and defensively to hold of
the Mules and earn the victory.
The Bullets largest lead was 25-6.
The Mules came back and cut the
Bullet lead to 38-33, before Smith
took the kickoff 82 yards and
scored his fifth touchdown of the
game to put the game away for
good. The Mules had a some fight
left in them after Smith's touch
down. Trailing 45-33 Muhlenberg
quarterback George Fosdick drove
the Mules to the Gettysburg 27
yard line. With 2:15 left in the
game Fosdick threw a pass toward

photo by Mark Aslrom
Paul Smtih rumbles for a few of his 220 yards against
Muhlenberg

his favorite receiver Chuck Draper
at the four yard line. Safety Kevin
Gurski saw this and stepped in
front of the pass and intercepted
it to preserve the win.
Despite giving up over 500
yards of offense to the Mules the
Bullet defense had several big
plays to help key in the victory.
"I am happy we won," said
Smith. "We were in a real slump
and needed to get this win. It is
very emotional. Everyobdy talked
at the team meeting and said that

Needed: News Writ
ers and Copy Editors
Call the 'Burgian
x6449

we had to get our heads in the
game. This is the most emotion
we've played with and it shows.
Everybody fought down to the
very last minute and we came out
with the win."
"We have to keep improv
ing in every phase of the game,"
said Streeter. The Bullets will
have their chance for improvement
Saturday when they travel to
Lebanon Valley to take on the
Dutchmen.

Congratulations Paul Smith

The Ultimate Netminder

by Chesha Miller
Staff Writer Beth O'Boyle is all about
athletics. Since she started play
ing soccer at the age five, nothing
has been more important to the
Gettysburg senior. O'Boyle, who
plays both soccer and basketball
for Gettysburg, has always found
that her best friends come from
playing sports. "I really enjoy
competing," Beth explained. "It is
my own natural high. I have such
a passion for both games."
O'Boyle describes herself
as a soccer and basketball major.

"I work by the books for athlet
ics," she commented, "I compare
everything in my life to athletics."
Beth's extreme dedication
to athletics made a severly broken
leg before her freshman year es
pecially discouraging. But
O'Boyle fought back, and four
years later she is the sole goalie
and starting point guard for Get
tysburg women's soccer and bas
ketball teams, respectively.
O'Boyle, who is fondly known as
OB, played soccer with the boys'
teams from the time she was five
until the eighth grade.

She did the same with bas
ketball, which she started playing
in the third grade. "I liked play
ing with the boys better," Beth ex
plained, "it was more competitive
and more fun."
Beth has continued to play
in a competitive, fun atmosphere
all her life. In high school, she
played for both the soccer and bas
ketball teams at the Academy of
the Holy Cross in Maryland.
At Gettysburg, O'Boyle has
had to overcome a lot, especially
with her broken leg freshman year,
yet she has worked her way to a
starter, as well as team captain and
star, of both of her teams. In soc
cer, Beth has always been the
goalie. "Basketball players usu
ally become soccer goalies, be
cause they have good hands," re
marked O'Boyle. This always
pleased her as it meant the pros¬

pect of a lot less running than if
she were playing the field.
As a sophomore, O'Boyle
was given a unique opportunity to
start as goalie when the senior
starter was injured. It gave Beth
the ability to gain back the confi
dence which had been broken with
her leg and to show Gettysburg
soccer coach Todd Wawrousek her
talent. "O.B. (as she has been nick¬

named by her
friends) played
exceptionally well
the last few games
of her sophomore
year, which really
helped her coming
in as the only goal

keeper her junior
year," commented
Coach Wawrousek.
After her

junior year, know
ing that she was
again going to be
the sole goal
keeper, Beth
worked extra hard
in the offseason to
return this August
in tip-top shape.
She enlisted
the help of a per
sonal fitness
trainer and also
gained many help
ful hints from
Gettysburg's new
goal keeper coach
Jaime Wilhite.
"The goal
keeper coach has
enhanced OB's

In her two sports Beth O'Boyle is either taking shots or
stopping them.

performance by developing and
fine tuning her technique," Coach
Wawrousek explained, "as a result
she is playing with a different ap
proach style."
This new style has had quite
a positive effect on O'Boyle's
playing as she has had eight shut
outs thus far this season. The
school record, which Beth is rap
idly approaching, is 8.5 games.
O'Boyle has also had a great num-

Whether she is shooting the ball into the net in basketball, or keeping the ball out of the net
in soccer, Beth O'Boyle always knows what to do with ball.

ber of "amazing" saves this sea
son. Coach Wawrousek said, "OB
is one of the best goal keepers in
the region, she is not flashy, but
efficient."
The success of the women's
soccer team this season rests
heavily on the talent of the team
as whole and is further enhanced
by Beth's prowess as a goal
keeper. "My teammates are the
reason we are doing so well [this

year], she comments, "we have
great unity both on and off the
field." Beth is hoping that the soc
cer team will sweep the last of
their season games and qualify for
the NCAA tournament. As soon
as the soccer season comes to a
close, Beth will trade in her cleats
for sneakers, and make the jump
from soccer to basketball.
"The hardest thing is to go

player," he says.
In addition to being captain
of both of her teams, Beth is also
a STAR (Students Teaching Ath
letes Responsibly) of both teams.
In fact, she is the president of
Gettysburg's STAR council. "I am
really proud of STARS," said
O'Boyle, "I think it is the one
thing that gets all the athletes in
volved together and I think that is
really important."

straight from soccer to basketball,"
Beth commented. "I have to ad
just from diving on the grass to
running up and down the court."
The change is most challenging on
Beth's body, but she makes the
adjustment well.
Beth, who is a point guard,
as well as the captain of the bas
ketball team, is looking forward
to the winter season. "I'd really
like to make it back to the confer
ence playoffs and
make a run for the
championship,"
s she explained.

* * " women's basket
t ball coach Mike
„ _Jj Kirkpatrick is
« t . ? counting on Beth
i.j_%_l. ' , .._~. to be one of the

team leaders this
upcoming season.
"I am hoping
Beth will keep ev
eryone focused
with her laid back
approach to
people," com
mented Coach
Kirkpatrick.
Beth's approach to
basketball and her
understanding of
the sport intensifies
her athletic ability,
according to Coach
Kirkpatrick.
"Beth under
stands the big pic¬

ture and competes
to the best of her
ability, which
makes her an
above average

Beth is also a member of the
Alpha Delta Pi sorority and has
written various pieces for both the
Spectrum and The Gettysburgian.
Beth is a psychology major with
a double minor in history and edu
cation.
She is hoping one day to
coach either on the collegiate or
high school level. There is also a
chance that as she has one year of
eligibility left, due to her injury
freshman year, she may return to
Gettysburg in the fall to play soc¬

cer. "I hope she takes advantage
of her last year of eligibility," said
Coach Wawrousek, "it would be
great to have her back with the
team another year."
According to both of her
coaches, as well as her teammates,
Beth has a great ability to read
people. She can anticipate con
flict and is always willing to help
resolve it. This is not surprising
considering her family back
ground.
O'Boyle is the youngest of

eight children and has, therefore,
had to work at getting along in
large groups all her life. "I love
having a big family," she said.
"Family dinners are the best; they
are usually pretty funny."
Beth greatly admires her
parents for what they have done
for her and her seven siblings.
Beth's parents have always sup
ported her athletic career and even
convinced her to go to Gettysburg
because of its close proximity to
home—that way they would be
able to easily attend many of
Beth's soccer and basketball

games.
Not surprisingly, for Beth,
everything comes down to athlet
ics. When asked which sport is her
favorite, Beth replied with a
chuckle, "Soccer during soccer
season, and basketball during bas
ketball season." That defines
O'Boyle pretty well. She is some
one who puts her heart one hun
dred and ten percent into anything
that she does, especially when it
comes to athletic competitions.

"Some of the top Division

Bullets' coach Robert Condon,
"This was a good race for us. This
is one of the toughest meets we
will be in all year."

come a better time as the Bullets
prepare for the Centennial Confer

day. "For the men, I think Jon will
be off a little bit and that is going
to hurt us," said Condon on the
Bullet men's chances at confer
ences. "I hope that we can give
F&M a really hard time for sec
ond place. Haverford should win
the title. If we are on top of our
game we should finish second."
Condon is not quite as opti
mistic about the women's chances
because the Bullets top two run
ners will be out taking the GRE's.
"I just want us to run well indi
vidually, not having our top two
runners is going to hurt us," said
Condon. "We will bring 12 run
ners and this will be a chance for
some of the ladies to show what
they can do."

The Bullets Cross Country
teams will be copeting next on the
Centennial Conference Champi
onships on Saturday, at Ursinus
college.

Men's Soccer driving toward the
post-season

By Rob Kraft
Staff Writer On October 29, at 2:30, the
Gettysburg men's soccer team
traveled to Western Maryland to
take on the Green Terror on a beau
tiful, cool sunny day. That was
about all that was nice for the
Western Maryland squad as the
Bullets destroyed the Green Ter
ror 6-0.
Coach Wright said, "I am
very proud of the squad, the men
have played with great determina
tion, and it has showed." The Get
tysburg men are now 12-3-1 for
their overall record and 5-0-1 in the
conference. They are presently
ranked third in the region and

twentieth in the nation. If the Bul
lets play with the same tempo they
have in the past three games they
have a shot at the national play
offs. The first half of play started
with the Bullets jumping out to a
1-0 lead. The goal was scored by
Chris Pryor, who now has scored
5 goals in the last three games.
The great play of Jon Katerba
again was demonstrated as he
blocked four shots alone in the first
half. The play of both Jim Green
and Matt Kelly on defense helped
the Bullets leave the Green Terror
in utter frustration.
The second half of play was
the bread and butter for Gettysburg
as they recorded 5 goals to jump

out to a 6-0 lead that the Green
Terror would never contest. Those
goals were scored by Oliver King,
Chris Pryor, Andrew Addonizio,
Brian Hill, and Josh Rubinich. The
Bullets offense again recorded an
other impressive shot out as they
have outscored their opponents 13
0 in the last three games.
The Bullets next game is on
Saturday November 1, at 1:00 at
home against F&M. Let us all go
to the game and give the Bullets
support.
Other Notes: The Bullets
played Swathmore on October 25
at home and defeated them 3-0.
They also played Catholic in
Washington D.C. on October 23,
and won impressively, 4-0.
