Residence Life changes summer housing policy

By Laura Root
StaffReporter The Office of Residence Life has
changed its summer housing policy.
Due to the maintenance that needs
to be done in all residence halls over the
summer, there will be greater restrictions
placed on the number of students allowed
to stay on campus during the months of
May through August.
In the past, Residence Life has re
ceived complaints about the conditions
of students' rooms that had been utilized
for summer housing.
Although students are cleared out
of the dorms by early August, mainte
nance often has not had the time to get
the rooms in top condition for the fall

semester. Now, the priority is being
placed on getting the dorms in better
shape. This summer, Residence Life plans
to use one dorm for housing instead of
the twelve that have been used in the past
in order try to renovate the rest.
Renovations are especially neces
sary in Special Interest Houses. Because
Gettysburg College does not offer sum
mer classes, Residence Life feels that this
is a reasonable change.
Several groups proposed changing
the summer housing policy. Residence
Life, Maintenance, and members of con
ferences that use Gettysburg's facilities
over the summer all agreed that some
thing needed to be done.
Action was taken in the fall when
the new plan was devised. Usually, be
tween 80 and 100 students stay in

Gettysburg dorms over the summer. In
ternational students, students interning
with academic departments, students do
ing research, students employed by the
college, and students who have no affili
ation with activities on campus during the
summer, but one working in town or at
tending summer school at a nearby col
lege, are all given the opportunity to re
main in Gettysburg.
The only criteria that a student stay
ing the summer has to meet is to have
been enrolled in Gettysburg College for
some part of the previous school year.
Currently, there are 140 spots re
served for summer housing. All students
will be staying in either Musselman or
Patrick Halls. The final decision on which
hall will be harboring students will be
made once it is determined which one

needs less work this summer. If any more
students apply for housing, Residence Life
may be forced to prioritize.
Students who need to stay in dorms
the least may then be denied summer
housing.
Student reactions to the change
have been mixed. Although they are
happy to have a place to stay, some are
disappointed that there is no longer a wide
variety of summer residences to choose
from. Tim Rupe, Director of Residence
Life believes that his staff has imple
mented a change for the better. "Our lack
of readiness in the fall was inexcusable,"
he says, "We need to be prepared."
Dean Julie Ramsey agrees. She be
lieves that, "This is a fair policy that will
cater to the needs of all students."

North Washington St. will be made avail
able as Honors Housing for the academic
year 1998-99, said the College and Resi
dence Life Offices of Gettysburg College.
About 11 students will be housed
in the new campus building next semes
ter, after renovations are made over the
summer. "It should be fully networked,"
said Scott Simonds, Assistant Director of
Residence Life, Apartments and Special
Interest Housing Area. "I am not sure how
many singles or doubles . . . primarily
singles," he added.
The house was purchased after
the owners approached Gettysburg Col
lege with an offer to sell. "It is the kind of
housing that students are attracted to;
close to the campus, much smaller than
typical residence hall," said Julie Ramsey
Dean of College Life. "We got a pretty
good price on it.... Not a good deal but
a reasonable deal."

, 3.25 and Sophomores with a minimum
of 3.5 and those recommeded by a fac
ulty member and under no disciplinary
action will be eligible to apply to live in
the house for the fall semester.
Along with 225 North Washington,
215 North Washington and Ice House
Building D will be part of the Honors
Housing. Tudor Apartments, which have
previously been Honors Housing will be
part of the regular selection of housing
on-campus for the academic year 1998
99. The new building was acquired to
help the college with the "housing
crunch" according to Ramsey. "We con
tinue to have more students than beds,"
she said. "It is hard to tell how the fresh
man class comes in ... may be large
again," said Simonds. "We need addi
tional beds."
Most of the buildings along North
Washington St. are Gettysburg College
property. "In the longterm it makes sense
to develop that side of the street," said
Simonds.

Honor Commission sees dramatic increase in number of cases

by Henry Fawell
Staff Reporter
The past year at
Gettysburg College has seen a
significant increase in reported
violations of the school's Honor
Code. While the exact number
of the cases could not be deter
mined, one Honor Commission
member approximated the num
ber to be as high as forty.
"This is a tremendous in
crease," said Brian Pumphrey,
who just completed his one-year
term as Chairman of the Honor
Commission, "I have been on the
Commission for three years and
never during that time did we
receive so many reported viola
tions." While the student-run
Honor Commission has been
working hard to deal with the
sudden boost in the number of
hearings, several defendants de
cided to plead guilty before their
respective cases had even

reached that stage.
One of the most notable
Honor Code violations at the
College occurred last spring
within the Computer Science
department, when fourteen stu
dents from three separate
courses were tried and found
guilty of plagiarism. In 1997,
nearly one-third of all reported
violations came from within the
Computer Science Department,
including another five incidents
unrelated to those of last spring.
This sharp rise can be at
tributed the computer's in
creased bearing on classroom
work, as well as the sti dent's
ability to gain a tremendous
amount of information off the
Internet in a short period of time.
With the rise in computer
related violations, plagiarism has

Administrator sues for being called a "Butt-licker"

College Press Service

puter glitch and poor proof
reading. To create the news
paper page, they had used a
template containing titles so
absurd no one could forget to
change them — or so they
thought. But the damage al
ready was done, said Yeagle's
attorney, Leisa Ciaffone.
"Even if there was an
accident, the laws of this state
prevent people from negli
gence," said Ciaffone.
Yeagle has asked the
Virginia Supreme Court to re
view the case and to decide
whether she is entitled to a jury
trial. A lower court dismissed
the case last year. Circuit Judge
Ray W. Grubbs said no reason
able person could have read the
article — which correctly iden
tified Yeagle by name and po
sition — and then believed the
bold quotes attached contained
Yeagle's real title.
"This is an unfortu-

Editors at Virginia Tech's
student newspaper claimed it
was a terrible mistake when a
Virginia Tech administrator
was referred to as the "direc
tor of butt-licking" in an edi
tion of The Collegiate Times.
The student journalists say
dummy type accidently made
it into print.
But the administrator,
Sharon Yeagle, isn't buying that
explanation. Yeagle, the assis
tant to the university's vice
president, believes she was the
target of a cruel joke and has
filed suit against the newspaper
for printing the 1996 article.
She wants at least $850,000 to
make up for the damage she
claims was done to her profes
sional and personal reputation.
Student editors sent a
letter of apology to Yeagle the
day after the article ran, ex
plaining the mistake was made
from a combination of a com-

nate incident that she has to
move on from and become a
little more thick-skinned
about," said James R.
Creekmore, the student
newspaper's attorney. "I don't
think a reasonable reader
would think this an assertion
of fact, and if it's not asserted
as correct — a person's repu
tation can't be harmed.
"But let's say someone
assumed the title was correct,"
he continued. "In this context,
it goes the route of subjective
opinion and impression. It be
comes a matter of free speech
and expression. What may be
a butt-licker to one person isn't
necessarily a butt-licker to an
other." However, the crude
phrase is easily defined as
someone who shamelessly cur
ries favor for personal and pro
fessional gain, Ciaffone said.
To make matters worse,
Ciaffone said, the article ap
pearing with the bold quotes

featured a string of glowing
comments from Yeagle about
the university sending students
to a state honors program.
"My client makes
some very positive comments,
and The Collegiate Times essen
tially calls her a brown-nosers,
an apple-polisher and a kiss
ass," Ciaffone said. "If some
one reads that story and they
don't know Sharon Yeagle, they
may not believe a word she
says." "Ms. Yeagle is a pro
fessional woman who is very
good at her job and worked
very hard to get where she is."
That is why it has been
difficult for Yeagle to endure
the snickers and jokes that have
come from co-workers, super
visors, and even her son's class
mates, Ciaffone said.
"People were laughing
the day it ran, and they're still
laughing," Ciaffone said.

become the most com
mon form of an Honor Code
violation at Gettysburg. Cheat
ing on tests or quizzes taken in
class constitute the lowest num
ber of reported cases.
Coincidentally, a slight
increase in student-filed reports
has not overshadowed the fact
that professors, who notice the
plagiarized works yet are ab
sent during tests an quizzes, still
file an overwhelmingly larger
number of reports.
Pumphrey, though, re
mains quite optimistic about
the state of the Honor Com
mission, "There is no evidence
anywhere suggesting that more
students cheat now than a just
few years ago."
He went on to explain
that the rise in student-filed
reports suggests that students
who witness a violation are
now more willing to turn in

their peers. This can attributed
to the Commission's active ori
entation methods for first year
students.
Tucker Marshall, who
succeeded Pumphrey as Chair
man, has been working hard
with the Commission to pro
mote the Honor System
throughout the college. "The
Honor Commission has come
up with several ideas," he said,
"including marketing the
Honor system through signs,
posters, common hours and
student/faculty surveys. There's
even the possibility of a web
page." These new efforts should
better familiarize the student
body with their Honor system
and prove that, as Pumphrey
concluded, "schools that ad
here to an Honor Code will
find that more students are
willing to take part in it, which
ultimately promotes the good
nature of the system."

Service with a smile

by Cara Masucci
Staff Reporter So many aspects of col
lege life exist that sometimes
one can spend four years at
college and never fully take
advantage of all opportunities
available to him or her. Amidst
the academic and social scene,
the sect of service projects can
sometimes get lost in the
shuffle. Fortunately, this is not
the case at Gettysburg College.
Quickly gaining national
attention as a school geared
towards service, Gettysburg has
many opportunities for stu¬

dents who want to get involved
a small amount or on an exten
sive level. From service learn
ing trips to Alpha Phi Omega
t(j> special interest housing, the
community and college are eas
ily accessible to anyone willing
to donate their time and effort.
A major facet of service
on the campus has always been
the Center for Public Service
(CPS). Starting within the
Chapel, the CPS has given the
college a large variety of issues
and opportunities for service.
Largely run by the students, the
administrators are there to as
sist in details and smooth out

the rough edges.
Various students coordi
nate projects with community
members in different area that
range from elderly issues to
hunger and homelessness.
The CPS also maintains a
large variety of yearly activities
and projects that include GIV
(Gettysburg Is Volunteering)
Day during orientation and ser
vice learning trips.
According to administra
tive intern Darcy Daniels, the
CPS runs both GIV Day and
Greek GIV Day, as well as the
Fiesta in the fall for migrant
children of the community,
AIDS Awareness Week, Christ
mas toy drives, and Mission of
Mercy.
Along with their main
projects, the CPS picks up vari
ous other campus and commu
nity projects.

Speaking with Daniels,
she conveyed the CPS aims to
raise campus awareness, not
only of each other and the
community, but also of the
world as a whole.
"There are people out
there that do not have the same
opportunities as we have,"
Daniels commented. "It is our
job to use our education, man
power, and strength to assist
them in their needs."

Junior Megan Mecca went on a service learning trip to the Carolinas. Here
students work hard cleaning up an area of woods.

land. Currently, if people
would like to get involved,
they can contact the CPS at
x6490 or
"serve@gettysburg.edu" If
there is something the person
is especially interested in, they
should specify their likes and
dislikes, and the appropriate
coordinator will contact them.
For those willing to get
involved on a much broader
scale, the center is currently
accepting applications for pro
gram coordinators to go out
and work with community
contacts and provide the cam
pus with an outlet for service.
Anyone wishing to do so can
pick up an application at the
center.

Senior Jaime Foanio
took advantage of an aspect of
the CPS over the fall reading

days when she went on a ser
vice learning project to New
York City. Foanio had always
been interested in going on a
service learning trip, but did not
have the opportunity to do so
until this year. In New York she
helped out an AIDS organiza
tion in delivering meals to those
in the advanced stages of the
disease.
Foanio said she really en
joyed her trip, not only because
of the knowledge she gained in
working with the AIDS patients,

but her opportunity to meet dif
ferent students and faculty
members from the campus.
One of over twenty projects
worldwide, the trip was not
entirely hard work. There was
time to go sightseeing and catch
a Broadway show.
Foanio was able to get a
scholarship that covered 80 per
cent of the trip's cost from the
CPS. Daniels stated that al
though they have limited re
sources, the center gives all it
can to the scholarship fund.
Other organizations are also
available to give out service
learning scholarships. Foanio
stated that the trip was such a
great experience that she would
"definitely recommend it to ev
eryone on campus."
For four sophomores, the
service experience that has im¬

pacted their lives is on campus.
Nick Stefonich, Jamey
Gallagher, Brett Montich, and
project leader Chris Hill have
a special interest apartment
that allows them to work with
the school in advancing recy
cling. The students record how
much water they use within the
apartment, and from these re
sults, they try to find a solution
to cutting down the amount of
water wasted. They also count
and recycle glass, aluminum,
_W8K1 £

etc.

So
far,

the quad has found that much
of the campus is not conducive
to recycling. Several dorms on
campus do not have recycling
containers, and the most acces
sible cardboard receptacle is lo
cated far from most dorms.
From their findings, the quad
gives feedback to the college on
how to improve the amount of
recyclables, and how many
people recycle.
The quad likes their liv
ing arrangement because, as
Montich states, "It [special in
terest housing] gives you a big
ger sense of responsibility." Es
sentially, you are in charge of
yourself, and this aids to a sense
of independence.
The students are quick to
point out, though, that al
though they are essentially be
ing rewarded for recycling, it

is something that everyone
should do.
To get involved in such
activities, contact GECO
(which the group has a repre
sentative in) or talk to the En
vironmental Studies depart¬

me. For those wanting to join
peers in service, the co-ed ser
vice fraternity Alpha Phi
Omega provides a good outlet.
Based on the principles of lead
ership, friendship, and service,
Alpha Phi Omega is a mix of
service opportunities and stu
dents from all different areas
on campus.
It has a brotherhood of
about seventy active members,
with a pledge period similar to
that of social Greeks.
According to chapter
president Mary Wilkes, Alpha

Phi Omega is involved in activi
ties like the Care program,
Habitat for Humanity, Adopt
a-Highway, and an annual
blood drive. The chapter is in
constant contact with the CPS.
Alpha Phi Omega also provides
service to the community by
doing things like ushering
events for other organizations.
There is a bulletin board
in the CUB where Alpha Phi
Omega posts its service
projects. If you walk by and
see an activity you would like
to do, just contact Alpha Phi
Omega, and you are more than
welcome to work with the

group.
Plenty of opportunities
exist for anyone on campus
that would like to get involved
on a small or large scale. Aside
from the opportunities men
tioned above, organizations
like Circle K, Bacchus, and the
Student Alumni Association set
up service projects throughout
the year.
Service can be rewarding,
not only to those receiving it,
but to the giver as well. Every
person asked about their ser
vice projects said decisively that
the service they had done gave
them a sense of goodness and
accomplishment.

Science for the young

by Allison Zoller
Contributing Reporter
How does someone so
young get placed in charge of
such important research? This
is the first question that popped
into my mind upon meeting
with the creator of Gettysburg
College's Molecular Biology
Department, Dr. Steven James.
In a generation hooked on ER
and Chicago Hope, the word
doctor no longer brings to
mind the image of a sixty-year
old man walking around in
hospital scrubs. George
Clooney and Noah Wyle have
popularized the notion of
young doctors with big respon
sibilities.

Although this typical pre
sentation may no longer be
commonplace, I was not pre
pared for what greeted me
when I first met James. Born
January 17, 1958, in Detroit,
Michigan, James does not look
a day over his 39 years. And
yet he is conducting research
that could lead to major break
throughs in the areas of cancer
treatment and physical rehabili
tation. Age is not important if
you know what you want to do.
While age may not be a
significant factor in success or
failure, education certainly is.
Young Steve James started his
quest for knowledge at our very
own Gettysburg College. It
was "serendipity," since he

wasn t sure how to go about
choosing the right school. In
1980, he graduated with a B.A.,
which would serve as his ticket
into graduate school. James
received his master's degree in
botany from the University of
Minnesota in 1983. After 13
long years of higher education,
James earned himself a new
title; the "Mr." changed to
"Dr." when James earned a
Ph.D. in Cell and Developmen
tal Biology from the University
of Minnesota in 1989.
For his post-doctorate
study, James spent three years
conducting research at the Uni
versity of Medicine and Den
tistry in New Jersey (UMDNJ),
under the care of Dr. N. Ronald
Morris. Morris became a role
model for James, as he was one
of the founders of Cell Cycle
Research, which is the area of
biology James eventually de
cided to pursue through his re
search.

In 1992, James was hired
by Gettysburg College to start
a Molecular Biology program,
bringing him back to the place
he started all those years ago,
thus finishing his formal edu
cation and starting a new stage
of his life: research.
James has spent the past
eight years researching two
genes essential for cellular re
production. The experiments
James and his students are now
performing are timely and

costly because the techniques
and equipment used are not
easy or foolproof. Where does
someone get money for this
kind of research?
Foundations such as the
Howard Hughes Medical Insti
tute in Washington were estab
lished to provide for young re
searchers such as James. The
Hughes Institute gives grants to
colleges and universities, in or
der to "advance the field of sci
ence." In 1991, Gettysburg Col
lege was selected to be the re
cipient of one of these grants.
Gettysburg was given the sum
of $850,000 to be spread over
a period of five years. This
money was to be used to start
departments in Molecular Bi
ology and Biochemistry. As a
result, James was hired.- Most
of his funding comes from the
Hughes Foundation, which will
run out this year.

A major component of
James' job was to begin and
oversee a research program in
which undergraduates can take
part. Part of the Hughes Grant
provides funding for a summer
research program during which
time three students are hired
full time for ten weeks to re
search gene cloning. Student
research in this program has
ranged anywhere from six
months to three years. Imag
ine spending three years trying
to accomplish one thing, in an
area where failure is not an
option. As James says, "You get
used to failure. There are al
ways going to be roadblocks."
In the words of James,
"Part of being a good scientist
is being able to choose between
things to work on - the key is
to have a knack for knowing
which question to-pursue; that
advances science."

What good would re
search-be if you didn't share it
with the world? In addition to
overseeing research, teaching
classes in cell biology and mo
lecular genetics, and finding
time for his family, James has
managed to write seven differ
ent publications. Dr. James has
also presented ten papers to
various professional societies, is
currently working on several
writings, and has received nu
merous awards and fellowships

Actors Darby Jared Leigh (left) is Peer and Debe'Taylor is
his dying mother in Peer Gynt, which will be performed by
the National Theater for the Deaf in the CUB Ballroom on
February 10 at 8 p.m.

Peer to perform

since 1980.
So far, James has just
been described as a series of ac
complishments. Although he
probably doesn't get away
from the lab often enough,
when he does, James has a wife
and two young sons to go
home to. He takes part in the
Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts,
_dnd goes camping with his fam
ily in Maine and Ontario.
James earned money one
summer during his college
years guiding canoe trips in
Quetico Provincial Park, in
Western Ontario. He relives
this summer by taking Boy
Scout troops on 10-day trips
throughthe same park. In ad
dition to spending time out
doors fishing, camping and ca
noeing, James has also taken
up cycling.

With everything else that
he is doing, Dr. James still takes
the time to get to know the stu
dents and answer their ques
tions in person, as opposed to
the impersonal but quick e-

mail approach taken by some
professors.
James is pushing at the
limits of molecular biology,
earning recognition for himself
and for the school, and he is
not even "over-the-hill." My
sentiments are best put by Dr.
James himself, "If you are
clever enough and enjoy what
you're doing enough to persist
you will succeed.!'
Last semester, each stu
dent in Professor _Marshall's
Writing About Science first-year
seminar had the opportunity to
interview and write a profile
about a professor of his/her
choice in one of the science de
partments. In an effort to ex
tend these insights to the entire
campus, several profiles have
been selected to be printed in
the Gettysburgian over the next
few weeks.

Reel Hits and Misses What the Dickens?!

Kf'JDan Larkin and Mike Petro
_fii_$i/Columnists
_%f.
'' : In many literary circles,
Great Expectations is consid
ered to be Charles Dickens' fin
est work. Granted, I am say
ing this not from experience,
but from something I read on
the Internet. (My sincerest
hope that I will not incur the
wrath of our fine English de
partment here on campus.)
However, I can say this
from experience: the new film
adaptation of the classic tale,
directed by Alphonso Cuaron
and starring Ethan Hawke
(who has lately turned to writ
ing fiction), Gwenyth Paltrow
and Anne Bancroft, is far from
an American classic.

Hollywood seems to have
exhausted the cinematic possi
bilities of William Shakespeare
and Jane Austen, moving on to
Dickens as the author du jour.
Like some of the more recent
Norton Anthology-to-big
screen adventures, Great Ex
pectations has been moved
from its original setting to a
more contemporary backdrop.
In addition; the names of
the novel's central characters
have been changed. Apparently
Dickens' characters' names
seemed out-of place in a mod
ern setting, so the character of
Pip has been given the much
more contemporary "Finn."
But, the change from the novel's

original setting is not the prob
lem with the film. Not to
worry, director Cuaron finds
other ways to disappoint.
For those of you who
don't know the general story,
Finn (Hawke), plays a brilliant
artist who grew up poor in the
Florida panhandle, lusting af
ter his best friend, the rich niece
of Ms. Dinsmoor (Bancroft),
Estella (Paltrow).
Finn's life is traced, in
cluding his upbringing, an en
counter with an escaped mur
derer (Robert DeNiro), and his
eventual rise to prominence in
the New York City art world.
Much like my synopsis of
this movie, the plot is full of
holes, and as a whole, the story
just doesn't flow well at all.
Hawke (Gattaca, Reality
Bites) turns in a good perfor
mance, as does Bancroft (The
Graduate, GI Jane) as the
quirky and partly mad Ms.
Dinsmoor.

As for Paltrow (Emma,
Hook), she turns in an icily
erotic performance that
projects a snobbish and heart
less demeanor, yet hints to the
viewer that there is a softness
within. In fact, one of the few
highlights of this work is see
ing Paltrow maintain the air of
snobbishness broken at time&
by tenderness.
Great Expectations really
doesn't do a very good job hold
ing the story together. The tran¬

sitions made by the film's many
shifts in time are not handled
well ( a problem augmented by
the fact that Hawke and
Paltrow look exactly the same,
whether they're eighteen or
twenty eight.)
This is, however, a really
good looking movie. Both the
scenes set in Florida and New
York are visually spectacular.
The rest of the cast is well
put together. DeNiro (We're
No Angels, Raging Bull) turns
in one of his usual strong per
formances, and one character

worth seeing is Finn's uncle
Joe, played extremely well by
Chris Cooper (A Time to Kill,
Money Train).
The supporting cast of
Great Expectations is probably
the best reason for anyone to
go see it. Cooper does an ad
mirable job, and Bancroft is hi
larious, basically stealing the
show in all of her scenes.
DeNiro is almost incapable of
turning in a bad performance
(hell, I'd have given Spice
World a star or two if he was in
it) and this is no exception.

My main problem with
the movie comes from the two
central characters. Hawke (the
thinking-man's Chris
O'Donnell) and Paltrow (better
known as Brad Pitt's ex) should
hold the film together, but in
stead they turn in fairly lack
luster performances, around
which Great Expectations falls

apart. As a whole, this movie is
a beautifully filmed movie filled
with lush and well designed
scenes. Further, the.well as
sembled cast does a solid job.
However, the plot leaves
too many questions unan
swered, and the fact that so
many changes were made from
the original make this movie
something I would say is best
left alone until video.
I give Great Expecta
tions, for good acting and be
ing technically sound, two out
of five stars.

In Case You Missed It
Pacino and DeNiro beat up the screen

by Eileen O'Donnell
Movie Columnist
When you put two film
legends like Al Pacino and Rob
ert DeNiro together on screen,
the result is explosive. Writer/
director Michael Mann pits
these box office giants against
one another in the 1995 movie
Heat. The supporting cast is
dynamic, with actors like Val
Kilmer (The Saint), Jon Voigt
(Mission: Impossible), and
Ashley Judd (Kiss the Girls).
The chemistry of this cast is
incredible, and it makes the
movie extremely enjoyable.
Heat is the story of Neil
McCauley (DeNiro), the leader
of a gang of high profile, tech
nically proficient armed rob
bers. McCauley and his crew
are pursued by the LAPD's
most dedicated cop, Vincent
Hanna (Pacino).

Neil has lined up one last
score, and is planning to leave
his life of crime and settle into

a regular lifestyle with his new
girlfriend, Edie.
His plans are complicated

(singer I

Hanna '
is also
trying
to get his

gether. His third marriage is
suffering because of his dedi
cation to his work, and his re
lationship with his wife and

s own life back to-

stepdaughter (Natalie Portman)
is disintegrating.
The plot of the movie
takes many twists and turns,
and all of the characters, no

matter how insignificant they
might seem, come together in
the end. Likewise, the support
ing actors are very important to
the success of the film.

Kilmer gives a stunning
performance as Chris,
McCauley's protege, whose
marriage is falling apart, and
wife Charlene (Judd) is about

t o
leave with their son.
Charlene wants

sanity
and stabil
i t y
into their lives,
and to
d o
that,

she faces the dilemma of turn
ing Chris in to save the baby
from a foster home.
Each criminal's relation
ship with his family brings a

more human element to the
film. _.
Only once before have
DeNiro and Pacino appeared in
the same film. In The Godfa
ther II, DeNiro portrays a
young Vito Corleone, during
his rise to power in the world
of organized crime. Pacino re
prises his role as Michael
Corleone, the new don of the
Corleone crime family. The
two never met on screen in the
movie, as DeNiro's role existed
solely in flashbacks.
DeNiro's McCauley is
quiet and reserved, yet in the
blink of an eye, he can fly into
a murderous rage. Pacino's
character is emotional and ex
plosive. These two film giants
are what gives the film pa
nache, and the story is substan
tial enough to keep you in sus
pense the whole time.

Heat is by far one of the
best action epics of this decade.
DeNiro and Kilmer have you
cheering for the bad guys until
the end.

Band to rock Huber

by Jared Kaufman
Contributing Reporter
Have you ever wondered
what it would sound like if you
combined the sounds of the
Dave Matthews Band, the
Beatles, and George Clinton?
That's how Joel Streeter, lead
vocalist, guitarist, and
songwriter for Fizgigg, de
scribes his band's unique
sound.
Fizgigg's innovative mu
sic combines the traditional
guitar, bass guitar, drums, and
sax with a cello and sometimes
a congo drum.
Bass guitar is played by
Kyle Gebhart. Of Gebhart's
bass playing, Streeter says,
"Kyle can really play. His tal
ent really comes through on
* Intruder.'"

Drums are handled by
Jeremy Gantz, and Dave
Winjum plays the alto and so
prano saxes. Look for a stel
lar solo by Winjum in the song
"Buck."

The cello is played by
Garon Taylor-Tyree, a cellist
with eight years of classical
training. However, he aban
doned his classical roots to play
provide a lively, upbeat sound
on tracks such as "You Stay"
and "Intruder."
Gantz also plays the
congo drum, which is used in
all of Fizgigg's acoustic perfor¬

mances.
On top of the band's
original material, Fizgigg also
does covers of Paul Simon,
Phish, and the Dave Matthews
Band. Fizgigg has played before
at Gettysburg, at a Coffee
house.
If you think you would
like to hear Fizgigg for your
self, then come to Huber Lobby
this Saturday at 10 p.m. If you
have enjoyed their music up to
this point, be sure to come to
this performance, as the band
has some new material.
And don't forget to re
quest the soon-to-be classic
"Shaft;" he's a bad...you know

Conflict and Consensus
An open letter to the campus community

I want to talk with you
about one of the most impor
tant issues on our campus—stu
dent drinking.
Let me begin by saying
that this is a very difficult topic
for us as a community to dis
cuss. Like many of you, I am
not a teetotaler; I occasionally
enjoy a drink with meals, and
it's hard not to feel either hypo
critical or preachy when talk
ing with others about "appro
priate" behavior surrounding
this issue. Yet as a college presi
dent, not a day goes by when I

am not reminded of the tragic
effects that alcohol can have on
a college campus. Student
drinking is widely perceived to
be the number-one health and
safety issue on college cam
puses today. Over the first part
pf-this academic,.year,,the na
tional media brought us news
of several alcohol-related stu
dent deaths at other colleges
and universities. Here at Get
tysburg, we have seen numer
ous students taken to the hos
pital for over-consumption of
alcohol.

While the issue of student
drinking is of unanimous con
cern, there is no widespread
agreement about how colleges
should respond to this prob
lem. Nationally, the debate
about student drinking tends to
be polarized around two ex
treme stances. First, there are
those who advocate "dry cam
puses" —that is, banning alco
hol anywhere on campus, in
cluding at on-campus parties
and in student residences. On
the other side are those who
argue that "kids will be kids."
These individuals tend to be
lieve that drinking is a normal
and natural part of the college
experience, a "phase" students
go through on the road to re
sponsible adulthood. For col
leges to interfere with this pro
cess, these individuals argue, is
fr> exceed the _hnnndaries nf

appropriate monitoring, step
ping too far into the outdated
notion of in loco parentis.
In fact, both of these po¬

sitions have merit. Yet for
many types of institutions, in
cluding smaller, residential, lib
eral arts colleges like Gettys
burg, neither approach is ideal.
For better or for worse,
drinking is a part of the way
that most college students—
and for that matter, most
Americans— socialize. And if
we accept that most students
are going to drink, we must ask
ourselves, "What in our envi
ronment leads to safe and re
sponsible consumption of alco
hol? And what in our culture
tends to reinforce and perpetu¬

ate abusive, illegal, and exces
sive alcohol consumption?"
The dry campus option can
lead to unmonitored drinking
in off-campus settings that are
difficult to supervise. When
overconsumption occurs,in
such circumstances, the results
can be deadly. On the other
hand, a laissez faire attitude
toward alcohol consumption—
one that allows students to
drink as much as they want to
whenever and wherever they
want to, assuming that they will
quit when they've had
enough—can be equally disas¬

. What, then, are colleges
to do? Each institution must
ask, "What makes sense for us?
What makes sense for our stu
dents?" Clearly, we must obey
the law. And there are certain
types of drinking—drinking
games and binge drinking, for
example—that are especially
dangerous and that should
never be tolerated. But within
this framework there is latitude
and room for debate on which
approach is best suited to indi
vidual institutions.
At Gettysburg, I believe
that we must address this issue
with a three-pronged approach
that provides support for those
who do not wish to drink, per
mits legal and responsible con
sumption for those who wish
to drink (and are legally al
lowed to do so), and provides
for quick and aggressive action
against illegal and abusive con¬

sumption of alcohol.
Make no mistake about
it: Gettysburg College students
are at severe risk for the dan
gers associated with alcohol
consumption. Empirical evi
dence supports our anecdotal
observations: A recent CORE
survey shows that students at
residential, liberal arts colleges
are more likely than students
at large universities to partici
pate in binge drinking. Students
at schools in small towns or
rural settings are more likely to
drink to excess than their coun
terparts at schools in urban set
tings, and students at colleges
in the Northeast demonstrate
higher incidents of binge drink
ing than students at schools in

other parts of the country. Fi
nally, students at schools with
active Greek systems are far
more likely to drink to excess
than students, at schools with
out fraternities and sororities.
It is essential, then, that
Gettysburg—and schools like
Gettysburg—take an active and
aggressive role in helping stu
dents negotiate the issues asso
ciated with alcohol consump
tion. For schools like Gettys
burg, single-issue answers—
like opting for a dry campus,
on the one hand, or arguing for
individual responsibility, on the
other—are not enough. Our
response must be more com
prehensive. Our response must
rely not on a single solution,
but on a combination of tech¬

ques.
First, we must continually
examine our environment, our
policies, practices, and behav
iors to determine what encour
ages responsible alcohol use
and what does not. Such evalu
ation cannot be left to college
administrators alone: students,
student organizations, faculty,
and alumni all need to become
involved in exploring and ad
dressing environmental ques
tions. Second, we must all take
more responsibility for creating
social options that do not re
volve around underage or ex¬

cessive alcohol use. To that end,
I have committed $50,000 this
semester to encourage student
initiated social activities. At a
recent Board of Trustees meet
ing, several students shared
their concerns about what they
believe is a limited range of
social options at Gettysburg.
My hope is that these new
funds will help broaden those
options, and encourage events
that don't center around drink
ing. These funds will be admin
istered by a special subcommit¬

tee of students operating under
the auspices of Student Senate.
Any student who has an idea
for a social event may apply for
funding from this subcommit
tee, which is chaired by Val
Katzmer and also includes
Mark Astrom, Rodwin Lowe,
Jen Gillette, Becca O'Connell,
and Marcello Ardun. In addi
tion, we have freed up the ball
room for several weekend
nights in the spring semester in
order to accommodate events
that might be held in that facil
ity.

Third, we should permit
legal and moderate consump
tion of alcohol in connection
with some College events. His
torically, since fraternities have
dominated the College's .social
scene, "they also' have domi
nated access to alcohol on cam
pus. Our current policies/tend
to discourage alcohol at Col
lege-sponsored events, thereby
driving all drinking (even legal
and moderate drinking) off
campus. This approach does
not allow for the effective mod
eling of responsible drinking by
upperclass students. This se
mester, we will pilot some Col
lege-sponsored events with al
cohol in order to help model
more appropriate drinking be
havior. Alcohol at these events
will be dispensed in accordance
with BYOB policies or with the
assistance of TIPS-trained serv¬

ers. Finally, we must chal
lenge Greek organizations on
this issue. While no one is pre
suming that alcohol abuse is a

"Greek problem," the presence
of Greek organizations is a fac
tor related to higher levels of
binge drinking on college cam
puses. A national study re
leased just before Christmas
indicates that fraternity and
sorority leaders have higher
rates of alcohol abuse than
members or non-members. We
all know how important the
peer group is in influencing stu
dent behavior. Fraternities and
sororities need to develop mea
surable ways to live up to val
ues in their charters stressing
academic achievement
and personal develop
ment. At this time of year, when

Rush and pledging are about to
begin, it is incumbent on all
who participate in the Greek
system to understand the dan
gers inherent in hazing, drink
ing games, and any Rush " event
in which alcohol is present,
whether on campus or off. I
must remind you in the stron
gest words , possible that such
activities will not be tolerated.
The four-year suspension of Phi
Delta Theta last year was due
to the combination of Rush,
alcohol, and drinking games,
which led to the hospitalization
of four students. We cannot—
and will not—^ tolerate such ac
tivities. We will continue to set
and enforce reasonable rules.

We have taken many
good steps and made good
progress in addressing this
problem. We must expand our
support for students who do
not drink, enhancing our com
mitment to substance-free
housing and similar programs.
We need to get serious about
providing alternative beverages
at all campus parties so that
those who don't choose to
drink don't have to. We must
continue our efforts to educate
our students about alcohol—in
wellness classes, in groups like
CHEERS and Bacchus, through
programs like this year's out
standing Alcohol Awareness
Week, and through programs in

To the Editor:
I am a weekly reader of
the Gettysburgian and also a
woman athlete on the campus.
Each week I look forward to
reading about how all of the
athletic teams are doing on
campus, not just the mens
teams. Ever since the begin
ning of the year such sports as
Volleyball, Women's Soccer,
and now Women's basketball
have been neglected by your
staff. The school did not even
know that the Women's Volley-

- continued from page 10 -
the residence halls. Finally,
we need to find effective
ways to talk about this issue
on campus. Numerous sur
veys show that the vast ma
jority of our students hold
very responsible opinions
about alcohol and its use. We
need to be more purposeful
about sharing this informa
tion in ways that will help
shape perceptions about
drinking norms.
This is an important is¬

sue, and inevitably there is
more to be done. I invite
your participation in our
ongoing conversation about
how we can best encourage
healthy discussion of this is
sue on campus and develop
appropriate behaviors in our
community. There is no is
sue that is of greater concern
to our alumni, our parents,
and our students. As recent
events have taught us, stu
dent alcohol abuse truly is a
matter of life and death.

ball team won the conference
and played in the NCAA tour
nament.
And now, the Women's
Basketball team is having the
best year in a long time and we
can't even be mentioned in the
NewsPaper. Tell me why two
months after the end of a ter
rible football season there is an
entire page dedicated to their
team? Do you know that the
women's basketball team is
now 11-3 and the men are 9-8,
but somehow that does not

make it in the news. Tell me
how we can get campus sup
port if our very own school
paper can not support us.
Please do not tell me that
you are low on staff members,
because obviously you have a
few too many if you have to
report on the changes being
made for the football team 8
months before they even play.
And why is it the paper can tell
the whole school intramural
scores and not the scores of its
own Women's basketball team.
I am not the only woman
who feels this way about the
neglection of women sports in
the Gettysburgian. I am writ
ing on behalf of my entire team
as well as many other women
athletes on this campus.
I do expect a response to
this message. I will not accept
the sexism to continue any
longer.

In elementary school, we

_lesks to hinder any threat of

Over 10 years later, we
till know that cheating is
vrong. On the Honor Com
nission in nearly every class

lonor by doing what is wrong."
Visit a school without an

t_'s more like high school there,
vhere you haven't fully grown

he assumption is that you can
nake responsible decisions.
That's a huge assumption
:onsidering some of the stu
lents at Gettysburg College. In
he 1990s, does such a thing as
lonor still exist? The fact that
_>ur president is dodging ques
ions of sexual misconduct, one
vonders whether honorable

Hopefully, people con

ty- The computer science de
>artment has come under fire
or the recent Honor Code vio
ations plague. It is easy to cheat

in the field of computer science
but also easy to be caught.
In a 100-level course,
some students found the only
way to complete projects was to
copy each other's assignments.
Like essays, even at the most
basic level, programs have a dis
tinctive style. Although in
stances are not as clearcut as the
average case of plagiarism, the
telltale signs of wrong doing are
blatant to a computer science
literate person.
The Honor Code is not
equipped to handle these kinds
of cases. The Honor Commis
sion has to confront the diffi
cult task of dealing with the
problems caused by technology

The Honor Commission
also faces the disapproval of the
faculty. The disheartening num
ber of violations each semester
lowers the faith the faculty puts
in the Honor Code. Some of
the major complaints concern
ing the honor system center
around the fact that the process
is slow, relies heavily on the
word of students, is inflexible
in the doling out of punish
ments, and is not reducing the
amount of cheating on campus.
While some would say
that only cheaters need an
Honor Code, others argue that
the honest people should desire
to uphold the Honor Code even
more. Side with the latter.

Conflict and Consensus
From The Donkey's Mouth

Judge not the man, but rather his policy

by Libby Main
Political Columnist
Should it matter if
Monica Lewinsky had a five
year affair with her high school
drama teacher? Should we be
lieve allegations that she had an
obsessive infatuation with the
president and that she told
people her goal was to have a
sexual relationship with him
before she became a White
House intern? Is Lewinsky's
credibility damaged because
she admitted to forging a let
ter from a college administra
tor offering a job to her lover?
Does the women who taped
phone conversations with
Lewinsky, Linda Tnpp, have

questionable motives because
she is connected to a Clinton
defaming publisher? What if
independent Council Kenneth
Star was involved in plans to
secretly wire Lewinsky before
Janet Reno authorized the ex
pansion of his investigation?
Despite the shadiness of
the information which has been
reported about Lewinsky re
cently, I frankly don't think the
answers to any of the above
questions matter. Neither do
the majority of Americans. A
CNN, USA Today, Gallop poll
that was conducted this past
weekend reported that Presi
dent Clinton's approval ratings
are the highest ever—69%,
which is also higher than

Ronald Reagan ever received.
(I say based on this information
let's re-name National Airport
after Bill rather than Ronnie).
In addition, 58% of
Americans feel that Kenneth
Starr should end his investiga
tion and as of last Friday he will
not be able to use Lewinsky's
testimony in the Paula Jones
lawsuit. This is because Judge
Susan Webber ordered all evi
dence related to Lewinsky be
excluded from the Jones pro
ceedings, making Jones case
less likely to hold up.
Despite the fact that these
sexual allegations against the
president have captured con
tinuous media attention, I
doubt that they will ever be re¬

corded as damaging and as dis
turbing as the Whiskey Ring,
Teapot Dome, Watergate and
Iran Contra Scandals in the his
tory books. These scandals in
volved political decisions
rather than the presidents per
sonal life. So while it is nice to
have a U.S. President who is a
moral role model, I think it is
far more important to have one
who is honest in the realm of
public and foreign policy. Be
sides, the British still loved and
respected Churchill despite the
fact that he reportedly held
meetings and greeting foreign
leaders in the nude.
Thus, the fact that these
allegations have taken attention
from President Clinton's State
nf fhe Union Address and an¬

nouncement of his balanced
budget proposal is the biggest
disappointment of the whole
situation. In the State of the
Union, Clinton took a more
moderate stance, claiming that
the era of big government is
over. Using money from to
bacco settlements, the new
budget contains proposals for
new teachers, more child care
money, more health care for
children of the working poor
and more health research dol
lars. Finally, the only questions
which I think are relevant to
this matter are related to how
much it is detracting from, and
effecting the day to day busi
ness of running the United
States.

Morality matters

by Cammie Grant
Political Columnist
President Bill Clinton de
livered his State of the Union
Address last Tuesday night.
Since then approval ratings
have been on a climb. In fact,
he has achieved the highest ap
proval ratings of his presidency,
according to a Time Magazine
poll. In his one hour and
twelve minute speech, Clinton
focussed on his successful ac
complishments and _encouraged
the voters to continue support
ing him. He did not focus on
Monica Lewinsky, but rather

on the future of Americans lives
and the future of our country.
To many Americans, the
approval ratings may come as
a surprise, particularly after his
alleged affair with Monica
Lewinsky. I for one, am
shocked. The public must be
captured by the artificial sincer
ity of Clinton. I will agree that
President Clinton, in times of
hardship, is at his best. In his
State of the Union address, he
came across as sincere and
pure, but is purity a good word
choice when describing our
president? How can we the
people trust and put the future

of our country in the hands of
a man who has been accused
of numerous affairs?
I will leave it to the vot
ers to answer these questions.
In a Time Magazine poll,
Americans believe that
Clinton's alleged affair with
Lewinsky was not conspired by
the conservatives. To the Re
publican party's credit, they
stayed out of the problem and
sat on the side lines watching
Hillary Clinton point her fin
ger in their direction.
Hillary deserves a pat on
the back for sticking up for her
hubby; after all, not every wife

would show such support and
faith in a husband accused
many times of engaging in ex
tra-marital affairs.
Perhaps many Americans
believe that the president's sex
life is personal, and has no rel
evance in assessing Clinton's
performance. Ask yourself,
what does lying under oath
mean, morally and ethically? If
he lied under oath, there
should be no question of resig
nation. In addition to, if he
encouraged Lewinsky to deny
their affair under oath, resig
nation should not be a ques
tion.

I must admit, it is a great
accomplishment for Mr.
Clinton to obtain the highest
ratings in all of his five-year
presidency, especially under the
circumstances. I do commend
our president, if it was from the
heart, for focussing on the fu
ture of America in his address.
If I were in his shoes, I would
be praying on my knees that
whoever else he has been in
volved with, if anyone, stays
quiet, at least through the re
mainder of his presidency.

The Pachyderm's Pulpit
Happy birthday Mr. President

by J ohn Dunlap
Political Columnist
This week the United
States honors the 87th birthday
of one of its greatest presidents,
Ronald Wilson Reagan. As
President Reagan suffers from
the pain of Alzheimer's Dis
ease, the United States will re
flect upon his life and accom
plishments. We have begun to
honor the work of the 40th
President of the United States
and his Administration. Across
America, bridges, buildings,
and highways are taking on his
name. The Congress will soon
vote on whether to rename
National Airport after Presi
dent Reagan as this great leader
is beginning to take his place
in history.

Despite what some in the
media and academia would
have you believe, Ronald
Reagan was one of the greatest
Presidents in our history. In my
personal opinion President
Reagan stands with George
Washington, Thomas Jefferson,
Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lin
coln, Theodore Roosevelt, and
Franklin Roosevelt as one of
the greatest men who have
served as the Republic's Com
mander in Chief.
When we look at our
most recent presidents, includ
ing our incumbent scandal rid
den Chief Executive, President
Reagan stands out as the

model. A key reason for his
success was that he was not a
career politician, the only eight
years he ever lived in Washing
ton, D.C. were those spent in
the White House. Ronald
Reagan was born into a poor
family in the heartland of
America, Tampico, Illinois.
"Dutch" as the future President
was called was raised in Dixon_,
Illinois and he attended a small
local College called Eureka
where he played football. Af
ter college, Ronald Reagan
would broadcast college foot
ball on a small radio station out
of Des Moines, Iowa. From
there he was able to get a job

with Warner Brothers, and was
off to Hollywood.
During World War II, Mr.
Reagan served in the army and
his acting career moved for
ward. Politically, he was a
Democrat who cast his first
four ballots for president for
F.D.R., and in 1948 cam
paigned for Harry Truman. As
President of the Screen Actors
Guild his concern over the
growing threat of Communism
began to alarm him. His fierce
determination to fight what he
considered an evil system led
him to head Democrats for
Eisenhower in 1952. By the
1960's President Reagan had
moved to the Republican party

and in 1964 he would
address the _^^^_fl

nation on behalf of the Repub
lican Presidential Nominee
Barry Goldwater. Goldwater
was defeated by President
Lyndon Johnson by a landslide
but it launched Ronald Reagan
into the Governorship of Cali
fornia two years later. Gover
nor Reagan cut taxes, balanced
the budget, and fought the pro
test against the Vietnam War.
The Governor was the titular
Conservative leader in the
United States and in 1968 he
received a great deal of support
for the GOP nomination for
President.
Ronald Reagan stood up

for his beliefs before anything
else and his determination
drove him to challenge the Re
publican President of the
United States, Gerald R. Ford.
Reagan took his campaign all
the way to the 1976 Republi
can National Convention.
Four years later he moved the
Republican Party to the right by
winning the party's presidential
nomination. President Jimmy
Carter ran a scare campaign to
defeat the former California
Governor but it failed as the
American people by a large
margin sent an actor to
the White _^^^
House. _^^^^^^^^^^ _m

of tur
moil and

the assassina
tion of President
Kennedy, the race
riots and anti-

^^^_H War riots
_^^™ of the 1960's and
1970_'s, the
Watergate Scandal, and Jimmy
Carter's days of malaise, a new
leader known as the "Great
Communicator" gave the
United States hope and turned
the country around.
He gave us the greatest
tax cut in the history of the
United States, an act which re
duced unemployment. Infla
tion and interest rates dropped
and since the Reagan Presi
dency the United States has had
the longest period of economic
growth in our history. With
only a minor decline in the
early nineties our economy has
never stopped growing. Liber¬

als blame President Reagan for
the deficit but in the 1980's rev
enues tripled and the Demo
cratic Congress refused to vote
on his spending cuts. Today
President Clinton and the Re
publican Congress are balanc
ing the budget and cutting taxes
following the Reagan model
and it is working. In 1982
President Reagan along with a
bipartisan coalition saved social
security and in 1986 massive
tax reform was enacted under
his leadership.
The Reagan Administra-

_^^^^r
' work and the
J_^_r accomplish¬
ments are end
less. During his
eight years he ran the
country we saw parole at

the federal level abolished.
With the help of First Lady
Nancy Reagan the "Just Say
No" campaign dramatically
dropped drug use in America
and saved the lives of thou
sands of children. President
Reagan fought for free and fair
trade as the United States and
Canadian Free Trade Agree
ment was negotiated but when
Harley Davison was dying, his
leadership saved it with a pro
tective tariff. The president
always did what was right for
the American worker.

Out of all of his accom
plishments, Ronald Reagan's
fierce determination to defeat
what he called the "Evil Em
pire" stands out. He rebuilt our
military, increased defense
spending, and engaged in a se
cret war with the help of our
allies, including British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher
and Pope John Paul II, to de
stroy communism. Coming
into office President Reagan
knew communism was dying
but he wanted to speed up its
decline. In 1983, communism

began its retreat with the lib
eration of Grenada, which
freed American students. By
the late eighties the Soviets
were ready to come to the table
and when President Reagan
went to Berlin and declared,
"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this
wall," the Soviet General Sec
retary did just that. Millions
of people worldwide owe Presi
dent Reagan thier thanks as
nation after nation has been lib
erated from the evils of com
munism. The fact that a piece
of the Berlin Wall can stand
outside the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library in Simi
Valley, California, is evidence
of President Reagan's place in
history.
More than anything else.

President Reagan gave the
American people hope and they
thanked him for it in 1984 with
a landslide 49 state victory. He
always had a joke, and his hu
mor was a nice change of pace.
His ability to speak to the com
mon person and talk about his
agenda moved the whole coun
try rightward. Today, Bill
Clinton is moving the Demo
cratic Party to the center be
cause under Ronald Reagan the
left was blown out of the wa
ter. In 1988, Ronald Reagan's
Vice President and former op
ponent George Bush won the
Presidency on President
Reagan's coattails and in 1994,
a Republican Congress was
elected for the first time in forty
years carrying the Reagan ban¬

ner. To honor our 40th presi
dent, Ronald Reagan deserves
to be carved into Mount
Rushmore for the American
people always to be able to
honor him. He gave us hope
and restored our faith in our
Republic. He never let the
American people down and
they never let him down. We
owe President Reagan a great
thank you, so thanks to the
Gipper, for all you did for our
country and for my generation.

"Staying on the right track": catch up with the Bullet track teams

by Nathan Grim and
Bryan Sentz
Contributing Reporters
The Bullets track and
field teams have begun 1998
full of anticipation for a ban
ner season. The women's
team is one of the largest in
recent memory, and returns
many key veterans that will
greatly contribute to its ef
forts to successfully defend
their title as Centennial
Conference champions.
On Sunday, January
18, a skeleton squad of the
men's and women's indoor
track teams competed at
Haverford College. For the
women, Beth Castagno took
first place in the high jump,
clearing 5'6" and tying the
school record.

Sophomore captain
Andi Thent tied for first in
the 55 meter dash (7.5) and
placed second in the 200
meter dash (28.0). Senior
captain Jackie Klug placed
third in the 55 meter high
hurdles (9.0) and Cathy
Spangler captured second
place in the shot put with a
throw of 33'1".
The men's squad also
turned in some solid perfor
mances. Senior captain
Bryan Sentz pole vaulted to
a personal record height of
13'8" that was good enough
for first place.
The men also were

well represented in the shotput
where Mitko Koburov had a
career best throw of 41'1.75"
which earned fifth place. The
shotput was won by Nathan
Grim who threw 5_T1.25" es
tablishing a new school record
and qualifying for nationals.
Last Sunday, February 1
while the rest of campus was
engrossed in preparations for
Groundhog Day, the Bullets
traveled north to Dickinson
College. This was the first meet
for the entire team and many
strong performances were
turned in.
First place finishers for
the women included Beth
Castagno in the high jump and
the 4x400 meter relay team of
Jackie Lumbra, Andi Therit,
Jackie Klug and Keri Hymen.
Emily Cerda placed second and
established a new school record
in the women's pole vault

(7_'0").
The 4x800 meter relay
team ran a strong race to finish
in third place. Other bronze
medalists for the Bullets were
Andi Therit in the 55 meter
dash (7.74), Keri Hymen in the
400 meter dash (65.15) and
Eileen Chazan in the200 meter
dash (27.76).
Molly O' Keefe took
fourth in the 1500 meters,
(5:42.64) as did Tracy
Swackhammer in the 800
meters, (2:34.93). The silver
spike award, given to the Bul

meet, was awarded to first year
student Ken Hymen for her
stellar performances in the 400
meters and the 4x400 relay.
The men's squad was
highlighted by strong perfor
mances by Brendan Clark.
Brendan captured two second
place finishes in the 1500
meters, (4:11.95) and the 800
meters, (2:03.92). His efforts
earned him a share of the menis
silver spike award which was
shared with first year pole
vaulter Will Hannema.
Hannema had a personal
best performance with a vault

of 11'6". Bryan Sentz placed
second in the pole vault. The
Bullets also were well repre
sented in the 5000m where se
niors Jason Smith and James
Smith captured fourth
(17:10.1) and fifth (17:30.9),
respectively.
The men have also filled
some holes in their roster and
will be very competitive this
year (13 0) and third in the 200
meter (24.24). Nathan Grim
took first place in the shot put
and third in the 351b. weight

Olympic Spotlight

by Matthew Eisenberg
Asst. Sports Editor
With only a day until the
1998 Winter Olympics com
mence in Nagano, Japan, CBS
has come under fire by sports
writers and Olympic fans. The
problem is with the tape delay
and air times of certain events,
such as figure skating and ice
hockey. Since the time differ
ence is 14 hours the winners
will be known by the morning
talk shows. CBS will be airing
women's figure skating, the
main event of the winter
Olympics, at least 14 hours af
ter the fact. Most of America,
if they desire will know the re¬

sults by lunch.
The critics are not asking
CBS to make the Olympics for
North America, but there could
be some concessions made. If
they were to have some events
at 10 a.m. Japan time they would
be on at 8 p.m. here. They are
not asking for all events, they un
derstand that the Japanese work
days and pay upwards of $200
for tickets to the women's figure
skating finals.
The loser with the time dif
ference is the NHL. They have
made several concessions to al
low players to compete for their
nations. The hockey times are
all 12 a.m. or later, the benefits

of this situation for the NHL is
questionable. It seems that the
NHL is using Nagano as a trial
run for the 2002 Olympics in
Salt Lake City, Utah. If CBS
executives were smart, they
would have requested that
some of the hockey games be
played at 10 a.m.
The winners will
definately be men's alpine ski
ing, with all their events being
broadcast live. Tommy Moe
will be the American to watch.
He was the first American to
ever medal in two alpine
events. He won a gold and a
silver at the last Olympics in
Lillehammer, Norway. He has

been recovering from knee sur
gery and hopes to retain glory.
However, CBS will still
give excellent coverage overall
and their ratings will be higher
than the Super Bowl because of

photo courtesy of ESPNet Sportzone
the wider audience appeal of
figure skating. Most sports
writers agree that middle
America will continue to watch
events even if they know the
results.

The nation gears up for UNC -DUKE

by Steve Jenkins
Sports Editor
It has finally arrived. No,
it is not time for the return the
footlong hot-dog at servo, nor
have the Spice Girls finally de
cided to kick back and bear it
all. Finally it is time for the
match-up we have been salivat
ing over for weeks. Duke ver
sus North Carolina.
Duke and North Carolina
held the top two spots in The
Associated Press' college bas
ketball poll Monday, setting up
a No. 1 vs. No. 2 matchup this
week. The Blue Devils (20-1),
who stayed in the No. 1 spot
for the third straight week, will
play at North Carolina (22-1)
on Thursday night in the 14th
meeting of the poll's top two
teams since 1980.

The game will be broad
cast live by ESPN2 at 9 p.m.
ET. The last 1-2 matchup was
Kentucky's win over No. 1

Massachusetts in the 1996 Fi
nal Four. The last regular-sea
son matchup was between
Duke and North Carolina on
Feb. 3, 1994, an 89-78 victory
for the second-ranked Tar
Heels. Duke received 54 first
place votes and 1,734 points
from the national media panel,
41 more than North Carolina,
which was No. 1 on 16 ballots.
However, Thursday you
can flush all the ballots and all
the votes right down the
_perverbial toilet. It is going to
be Duke's best five against
UNC's best for forty minutes
and that is all.
Who will win? Will it be
the Duke Blue Devils and the
composure of Coach Mike
Krewjewski, or will it be the
run and gun, in your face style
of coach Bill Guthendge.

If both teams bring their
best games and their best play
tonight, it will be a battle for
the ages. UNC stars Vince

Carter, Antawn Jamison, and
Ed Cota will look to pummel
the Duke standouts; namely,
Steve Wojcieowski, Trajan
Langdon, and Rickey Price.
Duke is like a man smok
ing a cigarette by a gas station;
they are blowing up. They
have lonly lost one game this
year to defending national
champion Arizona, and have
tortured their ACC foes by con
siderable margins.
UNC also only has one
loss, and has what many ex
perts consider two of the most
explosive players in college bas
ketball in Jamison, and Carter.
Both of these players for UNC
have dominated Atlantic Coast
Conference oppponents and
have showed that they have the
skills to shine at the NBA level
as well.

So if you would like to see

no cheesy ' uniforms. There

to get a good seat. Get some
wings, maybe a cold, cold,

Beckler & Burzio

The swim teams' "Killer B 's "

by Chistopher Bowman
B.A.S.S/Contributing Writer
Picture this: a blonde
haired little girl diving into the
pool at the country club. This
was how the swimming career
of Liz Burzio began. Liz, at the
age of 20, is a sophomore ma
joring in political science. She
comes to Gettysburg from her
hometown, Potomac, Mary
land. Liz has one younger sis
ter, age 17, who surprisingly
did not follow in the footsteps
of her older sister. The most
enjoyable aspects of swimming
for Liz include the friendships
that she has made over the
years, as well as two trips to
Barbados with the college swim
feam

Liz feels that through
swimming she has really been
able to have a lot of fun, and
meet a lot of people, some of
whom she has grown quite
close to. The country club pool
was just the beginning for Liz.
Soon after she began to com
pete in the summer leagues, her
coach encouraged her to con
tinue swimming throughout
the winter, in order to make her
that much better for the com
mencement of the summer sea¬

son. Throughout her career,
and still to this day, she com
petes in the 200m and 100m

backstroke, 200m individual
medley, and 400m and 200m
medley relay. The fondest
memory for Liz was at the age
of 12, when she maintained an
undefeated record throughout
the County Championship,
where her team finished first
overall, and she obtained the
highest overall point total for
an individual.
Liz also told me that one
of the reasons she is still swim
ming in college is because of
her coach, Mr. Mike Rawleigh.
She says, "He just makes it easy
for me to still want to swim."
Coach Rawleigh helps to cre
ate a fun, and hard working
atmosphere for his athletes,
which has enabled the swim
team to produce such a tremen
dous winning record over the
years. Liz Burzio is obviously
not a stranger to the water, and
neither is her friend, and team
mate, Mark Beckler.

Mark also started at a
young age, in his hometown of
Merchantville, New Jersey,
only he has Liz beat by three
years. Mark also grew up
around the water, spending his
summers at the swim club.
Mark felt that at the age
of four he was perfectly ready
for competitive swimming, and
decided to meet this challenge
the following summer, as he
joined the swim team at the age

Pholo By Emily Giatfelter
This Bullet swimmer has gotten out quick and is lengths past the competition.

of five. He hasn't stopped since
then, and plans to finish his
college career. He competes in
the events of 200m and 100m
breaststroke, 500m freestyle,
and 400m and 200m individual
medley.
Mark said that it defi
nitely isn't easy, but to help
keep swimming interesting, he
also participated in soccer,
starting at age six, and continu
ing through high school.
Though swimming is hard

work, Mark looks forward to
forming new friendships each
season, and loves to travel. He
also likes the fact that it helps
to keep him in good physical
condition.
Mark told me that his
most memorable moment
would have to have been when
he qualified for YMCA Nation
als during his junior year in
high school with a broken arm.
He still to this day feels
that he has never swum faster.

Mark loves to compete, and
accepts the challenges which
swimming present, which to
him has just become a part of
his life.
On top of this, Mark has
declared a major in Biochem
istry and Molecular Biology. As
you can see, if you stop by the
pool every now and then, the
many long years of hard work
and determination have paid
off for both of these talented
young athletes.

Women swimmers on top again

from Centennial Conference
Press Release Gettysburg remains on
top of the conference stand
ings with perfect records as the
women's swimming team
swept two more meets last

lets are 6-0 in the Conference
and 7-0 overall.
Gettysburg easily de
feated Western Maryland, 70-

by Pete Huminski
Staff Reporter The Lady Bullets had
their six-game winning streak
snapped Tuesday when they
lost to Franklin &c Marshall,
70-55.
Playing in their fourth
game without the leading
rebounder, Megan Malloy, the
Lady Bullets struggled on the
boards, being out rebounded
by the Diplomats, 43-30. Judy
Stauber and Jen Gibbon led F
&C M with nine rebounds
apiece.
The Lady Bullets jumped
out to a 29-28 halftime lead
behind Jaime Dawson's eight
points. Beth O'Boyle also hit
two first-half treys to put the
Lady Bullets ahead.

The Lady Bullets held on
to the one-point lead, 46-45,
with 9:48 remaining. The
Bullets then hit a power out
age going scoreless until the
4:06 mark when Megan
McDonald hit a jumper.
It was a little too late for
the Bullets because the Diplo
mats had gone on a 12-0 run
during the dry spell to jump
out to a 57-46 lead.

McDonald led the Bullets
with 16 points, while Dawson
poured in 10 more. Rachael
Rzemieniewski, Steph Dravis,
Lauren Frankford and O'Boyle

tennial Conference).
Saturday the Bullets shot
past the Shorewomen from
Washington, 70-60.
Dawson and McDonald
led the Bullets again each re
cording a double-double.
After Dawson hit a shot at
the first half buzzer to tie the
game at 30-30,
McDonald came out red
hot in the second half scoring
10 points in the first five min
utes of the half.
The Lady Bullets opened
up a 12 point lead on a three
point play by Carrie Kulp with
11:56 left to play and survived
a late rally by the Shorewomen
to earn the victory.

The Shorewomen closed
the gap to 62-58 with 4:24 re
maining, but the Bullets hit 8 of
11 free throws to ice the game.

Getting into the thick of things

Boys Basketball
From Staff Reports
He has started in just six
games, but already 6'5" fresh
man Greg Schreiber has been a
dominating factor in the Get
tysburg College men's basket
ball sucess.
Getysburg is 10-8 with a
three game win streak and is 4
3 in the Centennial Confer
ence. A pair of wins this week
against Franklin and Marshall,
Wed. (Feb 4) and another vic
tory over Dickinson (Feb. 7)
would put the Bullets right in

heads into the meat
the thick of the conference's
western division race.
Because of his 18 points
and 15 rebounds in a win over
Alvernia, and an 18 point and
eight rebound performance in
a win over Swarthmore,
Schreiber was named the
ECAC rookie of the week.
Those performance pushed
him right in the middle of the
race for team leadership.
Schreiber is currently av
eraging 10.4 points per game
and leads the team with a 4.6
rebound average. Not only is
his scoring and baord work

. of the season
improving but he has also
jumped to the head of the team
in shooting percentage; a re
markable 62.1 percent.
With sophomores Bill
Davidson and Richie Phiel fully
recovered from injuries, Gettys
burg is playing at full strength.
Head Coach George Petrie has
been starting Kevin Carroll and
Jon Bowman in the backcourt
with Schreiber, Pfeil and Terry
Schofield in the Frontcourt.
