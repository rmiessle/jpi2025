Senate proposes dance club,
pushes alternative social activities

Is the current status of Gettysburg's
social scene providing a safe and fun envi
ronment for students? The recent breaking
up of two large, unregistered parties in Apple
and Ice House seem to indicate that some
thing is lacking in the social oppurtunities
on campus.
In an attempt to deal with this is
sue, last week at the Student Senate's first
meeting of the year, emphasis was placed
on "alternative social programming" as the
organization's main goal for the year. As
past of this objective, a vague description
of a dance club under the Majestic Com
plex was proposed.
Senator Valerie Katzmar was
picked to chair the committee to propose the
project. According to Katzmar, the proposal
is in the "preliminary stages, but is a definite
goal of the Senate." She also emphasized
that other organization were interested in
supporting the project, including SAC, the
Black Student Union, and WZBT. The or
ganization are seeking student input and
opinions concerning the project.

Katzmar believes that the space
under the Majestic Complex will be ideal
for this type of occupancy. The main goal
of the proposal is to establish a place with a
club-like atmosphere with a bar. Only stu
dents ages twenty-one and above would be
allowed to drink, but all Gettyburg College
students will he admitted.

parties, giving students an environment to
safely and legally enjoy themselves.
Katzmar noted that "other schools of this
caliber have something like it, and this
would make us more competitive."
In a related effort to provide alter
native social activities, Senate sponsored a
BYOB "shrimpfest" and a concert by the
Pat McGee Band last Saturday evening.
Senators Emily Robertson ('00)
and Matt Eisenberg ('98) coordinated the
event. Eisenberg, who gives most of the
credit for the success of the shrimpfest to
Robertson, called the event "a step in the
right direction."
Eisenberg also stated that "SAC
did great stuff with Welcome Week," and

commented that he felt the campus as a
whole is moving towards finding alterna
tives to "just frat parties."
Eisenberg also said that ideas are
in the planning stages for more all-campus
social events, "it's in the works to set some
thing up with SAC and Senate, and some of
the individual fraternities." He noted that any
plans are vague at this time, but he stated an
interest in "Getting _theGreek system more
involved with the campus." The Senior sena
tor said that "we need to make the Greek
community part of the campus community."
He also credited the Commission
on the Future for their input, and said that
he felt that the campus has responded fa
vorably. "There's a lot more involvement
a very diverse involvement" he said.

I heard it through the grapevine: Rumors, rumors, rumors

bySteveSpicer Contributing Writer
"Hey Kate, did you hear
about Sarah's sore chin?" That's
usually how it starts, nice and in
nocent (not that there aren't excep
tions). But by the time a rumor
hits the mainstream of campus
gossip, it's almost always ugly.
Let's face it: we live on a
small campus. There are only
2100 people here, so it doesn't
take long for news to spread. As
an example, think of that old long
distance commercial; you tell two
friends something, and they tell
two friends, and they tell two
friends, etc. It turns out, using that
logic, that a rumor would only
have to go through 11 generations
of being told before everyone on
campus knows it! And as things
go through multiple generations
they get mutated.

Simply because everyone
has heard a rumor doesn't mean
that it resembles the original story
in any way. Remember that game
Telephone? It's the game where a
silly sentence, "My cat is named
Barberella," for instance, is whis
pered from person to person
around the room, and usually
winds up sounding something like
"Your orange gorilla ate my cat."
If that happens to a simple
phrase, try to imagine what the
ninth or tenth person to hear the
news about you is learning. Be
fore you even know it, you may
be engaged to be married, have

some incurable disease, be con
sidering joining a cult, or just
be a slut.
These rumors are danger
ous things, so why do we even
bother with them? Because
they're fun--duh!!! I can't think

of one person I know who
would willingly dismiss any
gossip at all (at least, not the
good stuff).
Some rumors, though, are
famous. Not the kind that
evolve into an exciting and tor¬

rid tale, but the type that start out
that way.
One story that springs to
mind is the myth that if your
roommate is killed or commits
suicide, then you automatically
get a 4.0 GPA. Don't get your

hopes up too fast; there's appar
ently an exception if you are the
one who killed your roommate.
Sorry. Another, rather morbid,
tale is about a student who was
so frustrated during a test that he

authorized aid.
Gettysburg College has a whole
set of its own rumors and supersti
tions. So far this year I've already
been warned about the "Ghost of
Glatfelter,"which is a popular one on
many campuses. The story, as I heard

The important thing to keep
in mind is that rumors are just that
rumors. The definition of rumor,
according to the American Heritage
Dictionary, is "unverified informa
tion of uncertain origin usually
spread by word of mouth; hearsay."
So if you want the absolute
truth, don't put much faith in the
rumors. But if you want to know
what's really going on, you'd bet
ter pay close attention. Who
knows? This week's topic may be
you, or someone living in your
dorm, or even someone "unliving"
in your dorm.

shoved his official No. 2 pencils up
his nose and smashed his face into the
desk; he, supposedly, died instantly.
Could that be an Honor Code viola
tion? Probably not, since it's not likely
that he could've asked the students
who finished before him for any un¬

it, is that there is a female ghost in
Glatfelter Hall who lures young
men to the top of the bell tower and
then throws them off to their deaths.
Not a nice chick. Is it true? I don't
know, but I can guarantee that you
won't see me hanging around
Glatfelter at night to find out.
Another such story involves
the "Blue Boy" of Stevens Hall.
Apparently many, many, (oh, what
the heck) many years ago a small
boy was forced out into a cold
winter's night. He was forgotten
about, and then froze to death. It's
rumored that sometimes when it's
really cold outside, a young boy's
face can be glimpsed through the
windows. I suppose there could
actually be a spectral image, or
maybe it's just the face print on the
glass from the last person who
looked out the window trying to see
the ghost.

Alicia clueless in Baggage

byJonFr oehlich
Staff Writer "There was only one thing I
never could have anticipated,"
Emily Hope.
"Excess Baggage" is a
movie produced by twenty year
old actress Alicia Silverstone - and
it shows. This movie, directed by
Marco Brambilla, tells the story of
how its two main characters, Emily
and Vincent, are thrown together
under a set of circumstances more
ridiculous than those of your aver
age "Bugs Bunny" cartoon.

Emily Hope, played by Ali
cia Silverstone, ("The Crush,"
"Batman and Robin") is a rich,
annoying brat who chooses kid
napping herself as a way to get
daddy's attention.
Though the role of a rich
eighteen year- old princess should
be fairly natural to Silverstone by
now, she seems to have lost her
edge in this latest showing. The
innocent and fresh qualities that
made her so likeable in "Clueless,"
perhaps Silverstone's most popu
lar movie to date and the one that

pushed her into Hollywood's
mainstream, are largely unappar
ent in "Excess Baggage."
It is fairly clear that audi
ences are supposed to sympathize
with Emily on some level because
of her dead mother and emotion
ally distant father, but audiences
will most likely be repelled by
Emily's frustrated character rather
than drawn in by it.
The story of "Excess Bag
gage" really begins when Emily's
plan goes wrong as Vincent, a pro
fessional car thief, played likeably
by Benicio Del Toro ("The Usual
Suspects," "Big Top Pee Wee"),
steals her BMW with her hiding
in the trunk. At first, Vincent feels
just like the audience: that he has
just stumbled into the wrong place
at the wrong time.

From there on in, Excess
Baggage" inevitably turns into a
love story. Vincent forms an at
tachment to Emily, and soon finds
out that the feeling is quite mutual.
While this romance, perhaps, had
the potential to be entertaining, this
movie doesn't bother to explore it
very deeply, thus causing it to fall
into the common grave of unde
fined relationships and shallow
characters that is "Excess Bag
gage." Added, haphazardly, to the
premise for "drama" are cops,
guns, car chases and a few random

gangsters.
One of the many problems
with "Excess Baggage" is that it
tries too hard to be something that
it simply is not - a funny, bright,
fresh movie that explores the lives
of young people through a set of
comical circumstances. Though
this movie did have a few cute
parts and mildly funny lines, this
goal goes largely unfulfilled, mak
ing "Excess Baggage" about as
fresh as Nebraska seafood. While,
if done successfully, this mission
might have made an entertaining
movie showcasing the qualities
that we see in movies such as "The
Breakfast Club" and "Dazed and
Confused," "Excess Baggage"
simply doesn't do a very good job
of taking an idea and going some
where meaningful with it.

If this movie was indeed
supposed to be about being young
in today's world, perhaps the di
rector should have taken a look to
see how many of young people out
there are actually pro car thieves
and rich little girls who kidnap
themselves to get attention.
Judging from the director's
past credits and fromthe producer
of this movie, Alicia Silverstone,
the extreme incompetence of "Ex
cess Baggage" should come as no
surprise to viewers. With this
project, director Brambilla adds
another flop to his collection in
cluding "Demolition Man." At
least with this movie, Brambilla
simply keeps piling on one con
trived event after another for the
express purpose of trying to make
up for the movie's lack of direc
tion and focus.

Though Silverstone herself
tests and surpasses the limit of how
far a pretty face can get you in her
portrayal of Emily, the supporting
characters in "Excess Baggage"
were, actually, fairly decent, con
sidering the constraints of the ri
diculous story line.
Perhaps the best of these was
Emily's Uncle Ray, played by the
eternally cool Christopher Walken
("Pulp Fiction," "Last Man Stand
ing") whose shady and intelligent
personality helps him to play this
role rather well. Other decent per
formances come from Nicholas
Turturro ("NYPD Blue") and
Harry Connick Jr.("Independence
Day").
Sadly though, these perfor
mances were incapable of saving
"Excess Baggage" from being a
border-line disaster.

Sewage kills 3600 fish

byStephBusch Contributing Writer
On September 2, 1997,
Glatfelter Paper Mill experienced
a power outage which caused an
industrial waste spill into the
Codorus Creek, killing approxi
mately 3,600 fish.
The waste consisted of two
types of latex and clay from the
coater process, as well as paper fi
ber and residual fibers such as ti
tanium dioxide and calcium car
bonate. These containments were
released directly into the creek for

15-20 minutes.
The spill turned the creek
"milk white from bank to bank,"
according to Joe Roth, a Depart
ment of Environmental Protection
(DEP) official.
It is quite possible that these
fish died from oxygen depletion.
When the sewage was released into
the creek, the bacteria in the water
and waste began to break down the
organic material. Bob Schott, a
DEP biologist, said that this, in
turn, "speeds up the bacteria's me
tabolism and depletes the oxygen
in the stream."

The fish may have also died
from an abrupt change in the PH
levels, creating too alkaline an en
vironment for the fish to live in.
Fortunately, this spill will
not effect the drinking water be
cause there are no intakes down
stream from the mill, reported
Sandy Roderick, the spokes
woman for Pennsylvania's Depart
ment of Environmental Protection
(DEP).
Company spokesman Pat
Sweeney said, "We're just as up
set and concerned about this as
everyone else is. So we're look
ing at ways to...prevent this from
occurring again in the future."
Even so, in July of this year
there was a spill from the mill due
to a back-up and overflow in a
man-hole caused by heavy storms.
There were also fish kills in 1993
and 1978 due to Glatfelter pollu
tion. These spills were also both
investigated by Roth, who is look
ing into this spill.

It could be several weeks be
fore the DEP has lab results on the
water samples collected. A notice
of violation was sent to the paper
maker a week ago, giving the com
pany five days to respond.
Glatfelter must provide informa
tion on why the accident happened
and how the company will prevent

it from happening again.
Glatfelter normally dis
charges approximately 12 million
gallons of treated wastewater a day
into Codorus Creek, according to
Sweeney.
The paper mill is currently
operating on a discharge permit
that expired eight years ago, but
has been extended while work con
tinues on a new permit.
Glatfelter has been in busi
ness is 1864, and is a leading pro
ducer of book publishing papers
and technical specialty products
such as the paper used in making
postage stamps, playing cards, and
hospital gowns. The company em
ploys about 1,200 people.
Glatfelter Paper Mill is
ranked by the Environmental Pro
tection Agency (EPA) as the third
largest polluter in Pennsylvania.

ing weeks with the Theater column

Prof shows women are
the same everywhere

tecture.' Through these courses,
and the symposium, the college
community will have the opportu
nity to learn more about the cul
ture and history of South Asia.
From the very beginning,
Aftab has been interested in
women's history and women's
studies. At the University of
Karachi, she was involved with the
women's studies program as well.
Aftab does not view the culture of
women in Pakistan to be entirely
different from the women in the
States. She says that the "prob
lems, issues, and concerns are the
same.". She relates that discrimi
nation is the same and that "if it is
happening here, it is happening
there." There are many obvious dif
ferences between'our culture and
that of Pakistan's. Aftab views the
United States as the "country of
options," and Pakistan as a place
of "limited options" and that "a
vast majority have no choices" in
cluding the area of marriage and
children.

Professor Tahera Aftab
quotes her mother saying, "as an
educated woman, you owe some
thing to all women...do something
for all of them." These instructions
from her mother have inspired her
to work in the field of education,
and more specially in women's
studies and history.
Professor Aftab of the Uni
versity of Karachi in Pakistan will
be a visiting professor and scholar
at Gettysburg this year. Her pres
ence here on campus works'well
with this year's symposium, for
which the theme is "South Asia:

The Next 50 Years."
Aftab, saw some "excellent
opportunities to share something of
her culture" here in Gettysburg, and
making this opportunity even
greater is that this year celebrates
the fiftieth anniversary of indepen
dence for South Asia. She also saw
teaching in the United States as a
gateway to being able to do more
research in the women's studies
field. Coming as a visiting profes
sor to Gettysburg also offered Aftab
the opportunity to be reunited with
her son, Faris Khan, who is a se
nior here at Gettysburg.

Here at Gettysburg, Aftab is
teaching three courses in conjunc
tion with the South Asian Studies
program this year. Her classes in
clude "History of the Indian Sub
continent", "Women in South
Asia", and "Islamic Art and Archi-

After only being in
Gettysburg for a little less than two
weeks, Aftab has liked what she
has seen. She comments that ev
eryone is "willing to help me."
However, she is a bit worried that
she may seem a little "rigid" to the
younger professors here on cam
pus. Overall, she has been im
pressed with the students and feels
that, as a whole, we should "ap
preciate the youth - they work
hard."

Dear Casey...

Dear Casey ,
I'mafr eshman. During
orientation I hung out mainly
with this girl. Since then, I've
made a lot of friends. I've dis
cover ed that my "orientation
fr iend" and I r eally don't have
much in common. I feel I need
to move away fr om her, but I
don'twanttohurtherfeelings.
She' sanicegirLjustnotmetype
I'dbefriendswith. Any advice?
-Stuck in Orientation
Dear Stuck In Orientation,
You met this girl in a time
of tremendous change in both of
your lives. At the time the two of

you met, you were so caught up in
college life that you really did not
know what you were looking for
in a friend. Perhaps you just
needed someone to pal around
with until you got yourself settled
and acquainted with those whose
interests compliment yours better.
Sometimes, these "transi
tional friendships" are hard to
break away from because of fear
of hurting another person's feel
ings. But you should realize that
moving away from someone is not
the end of the world. It happens
every day; people move apart, and
in the same way, people move
closer.

It is advisable to not com
pletely ignore this girl. Given
time, most likely the two of you
will naturally move apart if your
interests are as diverse as you
claim. If you let it happen natu
rally, then hard feelings should not
be a problem.
Dear Casey,
I dated a guy for several

months befor el decided to end
the relationship. Hedidnottake
_iteasily ,butlwasabletomove
on and have a r elarionshipwith
another guy for several months
after guy#l. Whenguy#2and
I broke up, guy #1 was dating
someonenew . Thenewgirlwas

afnendofmineJr ealizedlstill
hadfedingsfor guy#l,andnow
cannot take being ar oundthem
when they ar e together .Can you
help? -Leftover Feelings.
Dear Leftover Feelings,

Well, it seems that you have
made your bed and now you have
to sleep in it, regardless of how
crowded it is. What you thought
was the right thing to do at the time
now seems like the wrong thing.
This is tough advice. I strongly
advise that you, as one of my
friends often says, "suck it up and
deal." You say you can not stand
to see them together. If you still
had feelings for this boy, would it
not make you happy to see him
happy? The only small detail is

that he is happy with her and not
YOU. Try and be happy for him.
This situation is probably
also putting a strain on your rela
tionship with your friend. My ad
vice is to not let their relationship
cause a rift in your friendship. In
these upcoming years, you are
bound to date many men, but of
ten your girl friends stay with you
for a while. You can either try to
put a smile on your face and ac
cept what these events have
brought about, or sit around in your
room and sulk.The choice is yours.

Conflict and Consensus
Looking toward 2000: Too many candidates?

by John Dunlap
Staff Writer
With the election of Bill
Clinton to the Presidency
of the United States in
1992, the Democratic
Party controlled the
White House and the
Congress, as well as
most of the nation's
governors and state
legislatures. Today, over

four years later, Bill
Clinton is still President
of the United States, but
Republicans have picked
up 13 Senate seats, 41
House seats, 12 gover
nors, and over 500 state
legislative seats. The
Republican Party now
has control of virtually
every elected office, it
seems, on the national
level except the Presi¬

dency. In 1998 the GOP The GOP is notorious to

will most likely pick up
congressional seats
because in midterm
elections the party out of
power usually does
better. Without the
Executive branch of
government, you can not
get all of your agenda
through. The President
has his bully pulpit, his
veto power, now line
item veto power, and the
power of appointment.
No matter who is Presi
dent, he or she will be
the center of national
attention in the govern
ment.
This is why in the year

2000, it is essential for
Republicans to win the
White House back.
Republican nominees in
the last two elections,
President George Bush
and former Senate
Majority Leader Bob
Dole, only received 38%
and 41%, respectively, in
the popular vote. While
the Democrats look to
have Vice President Al

Gore as
their
front
runner,
the
Republi cans
have no
clear favorite
This is

Today there is a fresh crop
of Republican govenors
who are keeping their
promises and making
waves in their states.

very
unusual, though not
necessarily a bad thing

giving out its Presiden
tial nomination to the
most established or
already well-known
figure. Republicans have
nominated Thomas
Dewey, twice Governor
of New York, World War
II hero Dwight
Eisenhower twice, Vice
President Richard Nixon
three times, and Senator
Barry Goldwater. Actor
Ronald Reagan, Gover
nor of California, and
Goldwater's successor in
the conservative move
ment twice would stand
atop the Republican
Convention. Reagan's

Vice President, George
Bush, would be a two
time nominee. Many of
these men were success
ful, though in 1996,
when Republicans
wanted to portray them
selves as the "party of
the people" and of
reform, it was hard for
Bob Dole, one of
Washington's most
established figures, to

run on that platform. No
longer did the face of a
strong leader work
without the Cold War.
With the taint of scandal,
divided government, and
fierce partisanship in
Washington, the Repub
licans may be wise to
move out of the beltway
for their next party
leader. There are a host
of party insiders who
may seek the Presidency,
but each has his own
weaknesses. Consider
ing the lackluster presi
dential campaign a
Senate Leader ran in '96.

it is hard to imagine that
the party would nomi
nate Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott of

Mississippi. Despite
that, many party conser
vatives are angry with
him over numerous
issues. Speaker of the
House Newt Gingrich is
said to be considering a
run in 2000, however
with his scandal, his low
poll numbers, and some
of his own House depu
ties against him, it is
hard to imagine how he
could even run. Other

Washmg
tonians
who are
said to be
consider
ing the
Presi
dency are
Senator
Fred
Thomp
son of

Tennessee. Thompson
draws comparisons to
President Reagan be
cause of his acting career
and his ability to com
municate. While he has
only been a senator for
two and a half years, he
now is chairing the
Committee investigating
White House scandals
and while that may
surely give him national
attention, he can expect
the wrath of the White
House, which may hold
him back.
Today, there are a fresh
crop of Republican
Governors who are

keeping their promises
and making waves in
their states. Some are

better known than others
like the Governor of
Texas, George W. Bush,
who looms large in the
upcoming race. The
former President's son is
popular in Texas and is
already doing very well
in polls.
Besides Phil Gramm, other
'96 candidates are
looking to hop in like
former Tennessee Gover
nor Lamar Alexander
and publisher Steve
Forbes, whose flat tax is
growing in popularity.
The wife of '96 nominee
Bob Dole, Elisabeth
Dole, who serves as
President of the Ameri¬

can Red Cross, is being
tossed around. Mrs.
Dole showed great
campaigning skills last
year as she toured the
nation for her husband.
Having so many potential
candidates is not neces
sarily bad because while
a civil war is possible in
the GOP, it is sometimes
healthy to have a good
debate. Out of the list
that I have mentioned,
many if not most, will
not run, but with such a
strong farm team in the
works, then the Party of
Lincoln may be wise to
take a chance and give an
outsider the ball.

Welcome back...most of vou

I think I speak for most
Gettysburg residents
when I say that we're
delighted each fall when
you students return. It's
a pleasure to see you on
campus, and on our
streets. We've missed
your youth and vitality,
and your promise for the
future. Most of you, that

is.
Sad to say, there are always
a few bad apples among
you. A few, however, is
all it takes to leave a sour
taste. Each fall, you
announce your arrival by
tossing your cups and
beer cans into our gar
dens. This is an ongoing
ritual—as is the use of
our property as urinals.
Throughout the school
year, you keep us awake
with your parties, and
with the drunken mating
calls that follow-usually
in the middle of the
street.

At Christmas time, we can
count on you to cut our
trees, rip off our wreaths,
and hack our holly
bushes. Of course you
need to deface our
property, don't you, so
you can decorate your
rooms for a few days
before you go home
(where you can enjoy
your families' holiday
decorations).
And when spring comes,
you really get frisky.
That's when you rip our
our tulips and daffodils
out of the ground and
toss them on the side
walks. (You're so cute
when you're soused.)
When you've had your final
round of noisy parties
and Commencement has
come and gone, are we
glad to see you go? In
fact, do we wish you'd
leave right now? What
do you think? (As a
matter of fact, one or two

of you will probably
have to leave, after some
truly disgusting behav
ior.)
Wouldn't it be nice if this
year were different?
Wouldn't it be great if
you made some sort of
connection between your
own towns and homes
and families and ours?
Just like your families,
we take pride in our

homes, work hard, need
our sleep, send our own
kids to college, if we
can—and hope that
they'll take our values
with them when they go
Give it a thought, the
next time you feel like
tossing your beer cans
into our yards.
Maybe this year, we'll be
glad all of you came
back.

The Gettysburgian is a
newspaper.
As a newspaper, it is
our duty to inform the
campus community. The
Gettysburgian staff proudly
fulfills the role of the fourth
estate, challenging authority
and searching for the truth.
Gettysburg College is
very lucky. We are fortu
nate to have a student
newspaper that functions
separately from student
government tne admin

ana -
istration. Numerous ac
counts tell of student news
papers shut down after
printing mildly controver
sial stories about adminis
trators or student govern
ment officials.
We at the
Gettysburgian are not
subject to such arbitrary
disregard of First Amend
ment rights.
We are protectors of
freedom—a charge we take
very seriously.
We determine the
content and coverage in the
newspaper. We are truly a
STUDENT newspaper.

We work closely with
attorneys at the Student
Press Law Center to protect
everyone's freedom of
speech.
Some readers have
been upset by our recent
coverage of some campus
events.
We have a responsibil
ity to report the news, no
matter how it may hurt a
certain fraternity's rush or
bruise someone's inflated
ego. When unpleasant
things happen, don't kill
the messenger; The
Gettysburgian reports the
news—we don't make it.

T _* *
Likewise, the
Gettysburgian does not, nor
will it, serve as a public
relations machine for any
given organization or office
on campus or off.
But our most impor
tant job remains to be
defenders of the public's
right to know. We are
indeed protectors of the
First Amendment.

Plagiarism or Inspiration?

To the Gettysburgian:
An article from College
Press Service in your
August 28 issue asks in
its title "Plagiarism or
Inspiration?" This item
concerns a service on the
Internet that provides
canned admissions
essays for students to
submit with their appli
cations to undergraduate_,
law, or business schools.
The answer to the ques
tion in the title is easy
plagiarism. We would
like to think that this
article was printed in the

Gettysburgian simply to
inform Gettysburg
students of a new kind of
unethical business that
they would, of course,
never personally patron
ize because the values of
the Honor Code (which
Gettysburg students
endorse) deplore plagia
rism in any context. To
make this point more
clear, we would have
appreciated comment by
your staff appended to
this article (which was
perilously close to an
advertisement for the

editorial that expressed
the moral distaste we all
should feel for such a

This Side of _Cyrnsim
Sex before liquor ..

by I. A.
Isherwood
Contributing Writer
For some terribly odd
reason when I came back
to Gettysburg this semes
ter, I imagined change,
something different, or a
more enlightened out
look upon the overall
nature of college life.
Without much percep
tion, the reader can now
imagine my deep regrets
that nothing was differ
ent except for a few new
posters and flyers in the

CUB. Still though, I
vowed for a positive
outlook upon my return
so that I could get the
best out of my
"Gettysburg experience."
When I saw my first
group of freshmen, or
first-year students to the
educated, my heart
dropped and sank into a
pool of tar (in which it is
still stuck), and my
optimism was shattered
into tiny bits throughout
the rest of my body. It is
not that I have a bitter

unbinding hatred for
first-year students, it is
just that I fear for them
and the humbling experi

ence called the Freshman
year. It seems as though
first-year students are
regarded as some of the
most open-minded
people who are on our
campus just because they
are naive to college life
and, most especially, the
seclusion of Gettysburg.
What I resent is the
molding process, the loss
of individualism, which

accompa
nies this
sort of
environ
ment and
possible emotional
effects of
such adaption.
Now, before
any of you
put away
this paper

I guess I'm just a bit old
fashined, or not quite up to
date with the latest dating
ritual or alcohol-indued
sexual entertainment.

or
this column as garbage,
at least listen to a few
remarks and helpful
criticism I have to offer.
First and foremost, the
most revolting situation
is the "Red Zone" for
which we see so many of
those striking posters
plastered across all our
halls. The situation of
freshmen girls is much
different from the situa
tion of men on campus,
in that we are not people

easily identified at
parties or other gather
ings for the drooling
lusts of others. Fresh
men women, mainly for
reasons of insecurity in
their new environment,
become not only targets
but victims of a very
cruel and sexually
deviant tradition on
college campuses. The
equation is quite simple

combine an insecure
young woman with a
lusting older male and
throw in some alcohol,
you have a dangerous
situation. I suppose
lusting is too open a
term, so we'll just refer
to Red Zone predators as
character-challenged
young men.
Maybe I'm foolish, but I
can't understand how a
situation so obvious, and
so terribly stupid, can

still exist ma civilized
society. I guess I'm just
a bit old fashioned, or
not quite up to date with
the modern dating ritual
of alcohol-induced
sexual entertainment. It
is a sordid catch and
release policy of corrup
tion. I am not speaking
out against dating,
norrelationships, but just
against using other
people for

temporary
pleasure.
Such
pleasure
can have a
lasting
emotional effect on
people and
we all need
to take that
into con
sideration.
We also

live in a world where
sexual promiscuity is not
the safest option out
there for young folks
and, the more such a
situation exists, the more
work those wonderful
people at the Health
Center will have with
unwanted pregnancy,
strange horrific STDs,
and even possibly the
AIDS epidemic. Such is
the dangerous nature of
the world we live in.
I would like it if people

would just open their
eyes a little to the nature
of the Red Zone, and
whatever other zones
they might think of next
for other problems. (By
the way, who thinks of
these flyers?) I was quite
alarmed by the poster; in
fact, I was frightened
until I realized it was not
meant for me or any of
my friends. The sad
thing is that the problem
is not overlooked nor
under-advertised, but it is
purposefully ignored by
those to whom it is
directed. Such is the way
of the world, for which

our campus is a minute
speck of dust upon.
Regardless of the comic
potential of such a
poster, it is a serious
situation that cannot be
understood because it is
so common. The Red
Zone factor is just one of
those little bits of college
"initiation" which we
can all live without, for

our safety and the rem
nants of dignity in our
culture. It seems to me
that problems are evalu
ated when the situation
becomes a problem, or
someone is seriously
injured. We should not
wait, not with this issue
and let us try to make
Month Two of this
period a little bit better
for all of us.

their shrinking park budget Our petition
was filed and approved over the summer,
and we have officially become the proud
"parents" of the 1 Ith Corps Line north of
the college Our first "assault" on the
1 Ith Corps Line is set for 900 a m on

than four athletes placed. Right
behind Grim in third place was
freshman Mike Williams with a
toss of 125' 9"; senior John
Buskirk, sixth with a throwof 115'
6", and freshman Gene Fraus, sev
enth with a 113' 8" toss. Buskirk

Recording only two first
places, the Gettysburg College
women's track team captured the
1997 Centennial Conference title,
Sunday, May 4 at Franklin &
Marshall College in Lancaster.
The victory was the second in four
years for the Lady Bullets.
Senior Mak Green success
fully defended her high jump
crown as she cleared 5' 1 3/4".
Freshman Cathy Spangler
grabbed the other first place with
her winning discus throw of
116'11". Spangler was second in

the shotput with a school record
toss of 38'2".
Gettysburg's depth played a
key role in the success of the team
and no less than five players
placed in three or more events.
Freshman Anne Schenck was the
leader as she was fifth in the 100
(13.29), fifth in the 200 (27.13),
fifth in the high jump (4'9 3/4")
and was the lead leg on the sec
ond place 4x100 relay (51.27)
which set a school and meet
record. Other members of that
team were junior Jackie Klug,
freshman Emily Brown, and fresh
man Andi Therit.

Besides her anchor on the
relay, Therit was second in the 100
in the 100 in 12.74 and second in
the 200 in 26.21. Brown captured
a fourth place in the 400 in 63.30
seconds and a third in the 400
hurdles in 68.72. Klug had a ban
ner weekend as she posted a
school record and national quali
fying time for the 100-hurdles
with a third place time of 15.19,
and she was third in the long jump
with a 15'8 3/4".
Junior Wendy Johnston was
the leader among the distance run
ners. She nailed down a second
place in the 3,000-meter run in
10:45.62, was fourth in the 1,500
in 4:56.84, and was fourth in the
5,000 in 19:23.64.

in 50.86 seconds and a fifth in the
pole vault with in 11*5 3/4";
sophomore Kris Weum, second in

"Driving" through the
Conference

by Franc Candido
Staff Writer In the two weeks since the
season opener, the Gettysburg
field hockey team has played
games against Juniata, Rochester,
and William Smith colleges. De
spite how the win and loss column
looks, the Bullets are ready for a
season filled with drives, stops,
and plenty of highlights.
Right now the team has a
record of 1 -3, but dramatic perfor
mances, including a last minute
game winning goal by co-captain

Becky Griffith shows that there is
considerable potential for success.
For 1996, the team finished with
a 14-7 record in the regular sea
son. In Centennial Confrence play,
the team achieved an 8-1 record.
Presently, there are 34 play
ers on the team's roster. This
Bullet's squad is laced with talent
and returns 9 letterwinners from
last season. These players in
clude: Carolyn Anzalone, Tara
Chipko, Shanley Cooke, Laura
DeSario, Heather Donaldson,
Steph Fisher, Kim Fritz, Becky
Griffith, and Anna Spognardi.

opponent as she smashes the ball down field.

Donaldson, Fritz, and
Griffith plan to lead this Bullet
team to high heights as they ac
cept the responsibilities as team
captians. Last season, Donaldson
started 20 games and made the
All-Centennial Conference Team.
Fritz spent all of the 1996 season
abroad. Remarkably, she has kept
all of her dope skills intact be
cause she has started in all of the
Bullets games this season.
Griffith must know how
to handle the rock because pres
ently she holds three Gettysburg
records for assists. Last season
she was featured on the first-team
all-conference, and second -team
Division III All-America teams.
Bullets Head Coach Carol Daly
is returning as well. Daly is a 1983
graduate of Gettysburg. In 1980,
she played on the team that cap
tured the Division III national
championship.

This rough start for the
Lady Bullets will definitely not
last long. This bunch of dedicated
women will settle for nothing less
than a Centennial Conference
Title this year, and they are aimed
and ready to shoot at the ever al
lusive crown..

GOODBYE "WHITEY"-

Longtime Phillies standout and color announcer passes away at age 70

On Wednesday September
10, a great era came to an abrupt
end. Richie Ashburn, beloved
baseball player and announcer for
the Philadelphia Phillies, died
Wednesday in a New York hotel
room. Traveling with the team as
their color announcer, Ashburn
was a trademark of the Phillies
broadcasting network, and along
with Harry Kalas, he created many
vivid memories for all Phillies
fans. Richie Ashburn played the
game in 50's along with some of
the most prolific center fielders
ever. Names like names Willie
Mays, Mickey Mantle, and Duke
Snider often headlined the news
paper, while the more low key cen
ter fielder from "Philly," quietly
put up numbers that would get
anyone into the Hall of Fame.

by Steve Jenkins
Sports Editor

As a player, Ashburn was a
two-time NL batting champ and
the center fielder on the 1950
Whiz Kids, Rookie of the Year in
1948, five-time all star (the only
Phillies Rookie ever to start and
All-Star game.) Ashburn batted
over .300 nine times and until
1995 was passed up in the voting
for the Hall of Fame.

Ashburn was a classic
ballplayer. He epitomized the
word hustle and laid down bunts
like they were going out of style.
As a lead-off hitter, Richie's job
was to get on base~and get on
base he did.
Ashburn was the bomb as he
led the league in walks four times,
in hits four times, and in triples
twice, and his career on base per
centage was close to .400. For all
you fans who do not understand
this stat, Richie reached base 40%
of the time he batted. Dare I say....
"EnFuego."
The thing that many people
know today about the great Richie
Ashburn was his voice and his
character. Along with Harry
Kalas, Ashburn joyously an
nounced 35 years of Philadelphia
Phillies baseball.

Richie was most commonly
known for his announcement of
the birthdays of Phillies fans.
"Gladys Westinghouse of
Newtown Square, Pa turns 102
years old today...She has been a
Phillies fan for all 102 of those I
bet.." Then of course Harry would
agree, and the two would go on
announcing the game, as if they
were blessed under some great
star. For so many years Ashburn
was passed over in the voting, and

A young Ashburn poses for a
picture as a member of the
1950 "Whiz Kids"

Phillies fans felt all of his pain.
After playing in an era where cen
ter fielders were dominating,
homerun hitting, base clearing
legends, Richie was denied the re
spect of many of those great play
ers even though he had compiled
some wonderful numbers.
Finally in 1995, Richie
Ashburn was voted in to the Ma
jor League Baseball Hall of Fame
in Cooperstown, New York.
Richie was enshired to
gether with Michael Jack Schmidt,
a Philadelphia Phillie that he saw
hit 544 career homeruns. The two
Phillies from two different genera¬

tions of baseball drew the biggest
crowd ever in Cooperstown,
28,000 fans strong, including 200
buses from Philadelphia. "We
have lost a cherished friend," said
Mike Schmidt, "you didn't have
to know him personally to con
sider him a friend."
If you were to ask someone,
"What do you think of when I say
Philadelphia Phillies?", undoubt
edly, one of the most prevalent an
swers would be "Richie Ashburn,
of course." Not only was Richie a
great man, but he was everything
that the game of baseball was sup
posed to be.

In an era when no player
complained about contract rene
gotiations, management disputes
or salary arbitration, Ashburn was
sliding in cleats first. He was an
artist of the bunt, and a consum
mate worker who never left a
single thing on the field except his
heart and soul.
Richie, we will never forget
you, in us you have instilled your
ideas, your knowledge, and a little
piece of your spirit. We will never
forget the "Right down the middle
for a ball," or the many "Long,
drive deep to left-center," calls.
You will always remain in
the upper echelons of baseball,
and you knew exactly what it
meant to be a true ballplayer and
a true Philadelphia Phillie.

As Chris Felton picked up the extra point that
junior Tom "smooth as silk" Olchon had just
knocked and ran it back ninety yards for a two point
conversion, he was probably thinking, "You know,
I bet I could make a damn good halfback."
Then, as if God were saying: "Felton, you
animal, just stick to defense," the lights went out
at Albright Stadium. Honestly. Expert football
analyst and sophomore defensive back Chris
"Sweet Lou" Lunardi reported: "It was one of the
most amazing things I've ever seen in a football
game...if I were Albright, after Felton made that
run, I would have turned the lights out too."
The Bullets did have an impressive showing
last Friday night in Reading, Pennsylvania. Al
though the unofficial score was 31-16 in favor of
Albright, Gettysburg played the number two team
in the nation for Divison III quite tough.
Leading the offense were full back Paul "You
can't stop me you can only hope to contain me"
Smith, who ran for 210 all purpose yards, of which
140 were rushing, and halfback Matt Helwig, who
scored two touchdowns for three and six yards re
spectively.

The defense looked strong in containing the
fearsome Albright offense. Led by Kevin "Chew
'em up and spit 'em out" Gurski, the Bullets held
like a wall until the fourth quarter when Albright
began to turn on the juice.
The defensive line also played very well with
Pete "Wild Man" Scaffidi gaining a sack and Gene

Kraus chalking up ten solo tackles.
Towards the end of the game, tempers flared
Chris Felton was ejected for fighting with an op
posing player. Said Felton: "Football is an ag
gressive game; sometimes the refs can't handle it.'

one senior from last year's NCAA
tournament squad, but it was their
starting setter. Sophomore Jenna
McKinsey is the leading candidate
for the spot. Classmate Catherine
Schott is the Conference's best hit

sixth nationally in hitting percent
age (41.5) a year ago, while re
cording 528 kills (4.16 per game)
