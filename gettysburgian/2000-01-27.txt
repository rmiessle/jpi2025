People who headed toward their

It's beginning to look a lot like
Christmas.
The Farmers' Almanac seems to
have been correct in predicting snow
storms January 24 through 27. Because
of a slow start to the season, coupled
with an Indian summer, the weather is
playing catch-up with the calendar.
And we poor students have to pay the
price. On Tuesday, Jan 25 th, Gettysburg
College closed down as a result of a
snow related emergency for the first
time in six years. All classes were can
celled along with some of the athletic
teams' practices.
Despite the shutdown, the Col
lege is not just a school, but a living
environment as well. Many staffers,
including members of facilities services
and the dining hall, still had to find their
way to work.
Servo was surprisingly packed,
despite the precipitation and high winds

o'clock, after many had already left for
class. At the time it was issued, the
message stated that cancellation was at
the discretion of the professors. Many
professors arrived to teach, and found
out upon arrival that school was closed.
While we students had to walk in
the cold and ice to class, some profes
sors had to shovel their driveways for a
half an hour, and then navigate the
treacherous roads. That is why, influ
enced by weather reports and sugges
tions from Safety and Security, the Pro-

photo by Steve Spioei
Facilities Services worked overtime to clear campus walkways and roads;
however, the storm continually pounded the area until late Tuesday night.

A

powerful Noreaster moved through
the region Tuesday, blanketing the
area in snow and ice.
vost, in place of President Holland,
made the decision to close Gettysburg's
doors. Policy dictates that the Provost
make such decisions when the president
is unavailable.
The students managed to salvage
the day, with many taking on
Mummasburg hill with sleds, or reason
able imitations (inner tubes and Servo
trays among them.) Such togetherness
has not been witnessed since the black
out of'99.
Adverse effects were still felt on
Wednesday, and The Farmers' Almanac
calls for snow showers again February
8 to 11, possibly with heavy accumula
tions. Don't put your sleds away.

The blotter: a weekly look at campus

Western Illinois
University
MACOMB, III. (TMS) —
Three students — including a
criminal justice major - were
arrested after stealing an am
bulance left running outside a
Western Illinois University resi
dence hall early Saturday
morning.
Paramedics came to the
dorm to help treat a student
who had had too much to
drink. The students, as well as
a 17-year-old who is not a stu
dent, spotted the ambulance
outside the residence hall, en
tered the vehicle and drove off
with emergency lights flashing,
according to police.

A WIU police officer
found the abandoned ambu
lance about two blocks
away.Police arrested Joel
Edmondson, 18, Daniel
Connelly, 18, Mehmed
Skenderi, 20, and Osman
Skenden, 17.
Edmondson, the criminal
justice major, was charged with
underage drinking, criminal
trespassing and driving on a
suspended license and released
on $100 bond. Connelly was
charged with underage drink
ing, criminal trespassing and
misdemeanor theft and re
leased on $100 bond. The
Skendens were charged with
underage drinking, according
to police.

EAST LANSING, Mich.
(TMS) — A radical environ
mental group has claimed re
sponsibility for setting a fire
that destroyed offices housing
a Michigan State University lab
that delivers biotechnology re
search to scientists in the third
world.
In a letter sent to several
Michigan newspapers, a group
calling itself the Earth Libera
tion Front, or ELF, said it ob
jected to research designed to
"lobby developing countries to
abandon their current agricul
tural practices and to rely on
genetically engineered plants."
The group also has claimed
credit for burning down a for
est-products company in Or¬

egon in Decembei and tor set
ting fire to buildings- at a Vail,
Colo., ski resort in 1998.
The MSU fire, which was
set on New Year's Eve, caused
nearly $500,000 m damage and
destroyed all the records and
equipment used by the
university's Biotechnology
Support Project. The project is
primarily supported by the U.S.
Agency for International De
velopment and has received
$15 million since 1991. Re
searchers teach concepts in ge
netic engineering and crop
raising to scientists around the
world, in part to help some

countries fight severe food
shortages.
MSU officials have
cracked down on security
around the building.
"Security is always a con
cern," said Michael Allen, an
animal science professor. "(Se
curity) is difficult to control on
campus because of classrooms
in the same building that have
to be open at different hours."
TUSCON, Ariz. (TMS)
— Police at the University of
Arizona were not buying one
student's story that she acciden
tally sprayed another student's
face with a self-defense chemi
cal spray.

Michelle Souza, 18, was
arrested after she sprayed the
face of another unidentified
female student at a UA resi
dence hall.
When officers asked
Souza why she sprayed the vic
tim, she told them that as she
and the victim entered the el
evator, the spray somehow un
intentionally sprayed the victim
in the face. The arresting offic
ers said they doubted Souza's
statement when they saw the
spray was kept in a leather case
with a button guard to prevent
such an occurrence.
Officers cited Souza on
suspicion of assault resulting in
minor injury, according to the
Arizona Wildcat. Souza was
released at the scene, and the
victim was treated and released
by paramedics with the Tucson
Fire Department.

CARBONDALE, 111.
(TMS) — Police at Southern
Illinois University at
Carbondale are investigating
several students who had alleg¬

edly obtained student loans to
taling $42,000 illegally.
According to the Daily
Egyptian, an unidentified SIUC
employee told police he wit
nessed several people taking
bogus direct student loans. Po
lice have not released any other
details in the matter, but they
are continuing their investiga
tion. CHAPEL HILL, N.C.
(TMS) — A trial date still must
be set for a Chapel Hill man
accused in the kidnapping and
rape of a local woman.
Efrem Zimbahst Brittian,
33, was arrested on Jan. 17 and
charged him with three counts
of second-degree rape, eight
counts of sexual offense, two
counts of first-degree kidnap
ping, one count of common
law robbery and one count of
first-degree burglary, according
to the Daily Tar Heel.

According to a Chapel
Hill police spokeswoman, the
victim was attacked in her bed
room and raped numerous
times. Although, the victim was
not taken from her home, the
kidnapping charge steams from
her being kept against her will.
The victim was able to escape
when her attacker fell asleep
after the assaults; she then
called police from her cellular
phone.
Police responded to the
call and arrested Rrittian. He

is being held at the Orange
County Jail in Hillsborough
in hen of a $125,000 secured
bond, according to the Daily
Tar Heel.
TUSCON, Ariz. (TMS)
— Executive members of the
University of
Anzona'sResidence Hall As
sociation face allegations of
financial mismanagement
and personal impropriety
that could result in their dis
missal.
A committee of RAH

delegates and UA's vice presi
dent of campus affairs met
recently to discuss allegations
against some board mem
bers. Among the charges:
Board members spent $ 1,200
on a couch for a residence
hall office when only $200
was approved; they inten
tionally over-budgeted for
food provided at business
events so they could keep
leftovers for themselves; they
performed sexual acts in the
RHA office.

"I realized that I cannot
work for an organization that
is corrupt... this organization
has potential ... right now,
and for the past 10 months,
it has not been serving that
potential," Laura Winsky,
RHA vice president said, ac
cording to minutes from the
meeting.

Gettysbuig's Wister Quartet to perform

at Sunderman concert

newest
sculpture:
GqMigstock

By Mary Dolheimer
Director of Media
Relations
Gettysburg College re
cently received an early Christ
mas gift from Jim Agard, asso
ciate professor of visual arts.
Agard ' s latest sculpture -
Gapingstock (an object of
open-mouthed curiosity) - has
been placed temporarily on the
lawn just south of Schmucker
Hall. The steel structure,
which weighs approximately
2400 pounds, is 19 feet long,
10 feet high and two-and-a-half
feet deep.
"Gapingstock is an inte¬

grated collection of forces that
remain remarkably stable, co
hesive, and balanced, consider
ing the disparate nature of its
primary elements," Agard said.
The sculpture will be
moved in April to Chicago for
the Pier Walk 2000 exhibition,
where it will remain on exhibit
through November, along with
120 other sculptures from 14
countries. Pier Walk 2000,
sponsored by Sears and Ameri
can Airlines, is the largest out
door sculpture exhibition in the
world, according to Agard.

Nicaragua Night 2000

FROM GCPR
In 1989, a group of com
munity members organized
Project Gettysburg/Leon after a
trip to Nicaragua. On Febru
ary 13, 1990, the Borough
Council of Gettysburg officially
accepted Leon as its sister-city.
Since then, that group of PGL
members has grown as other
members of the community and
Gettysburg College have joined
the effort to become better ac
quainted with our friends in
Leon. Many local residents
have committed themselves to
helping the residents of commu
nities in and around Leon in
their struggle to overcome the
poverty and oppression so com
mon in Central America.

Each year, Project
Gettysburg Leon sponsors a
chili dinner and Nicaragua
Night Auction as its major
fundraising event. Donors con
tribute everything from week
end getaways to works of art.
Popular items that can be bid on
through both silent and live bids
include sports tickets, theme
baskets, flowers, food items,
and various services. Nicaragua
Night 1999 raised over $ 17,000
to support the PGL program in
Nicaragua.

Nicaragua Night 2000
will take place on Saturday,
January 29 in the CUB Ball
room, beginning at 5 p.m.,
when items will be available
for viewing prior to the chili
dinner which will begin at
a5:30 p.m., followed by an
auction at 6:30 p.m. Tickets
are $6.00 and are available
from many PGL members.
They can also be obtained by
calling Rebecca at 337-6866 or
Marge at 334-4445. Tables for
ten at the cost of $50 may be
reserved by calling Marge at
the above number.
Project Gettysburg-Leon

operates entirely on volunteer
hours and donations. A small
core of volunteers from the
Gettysburg community work
together to raise funds and
staff the PGL programs in
Nicaragua. They also coordi
nate delegations to Leon, as
well as other international pro
grams and exchanges which
promote the mission of this
Sister-City Project. Anyone
interested in becoming a part
of the February community
delegation to Nicaragua
should call Lou at 334-4488.
For additional information,
call Janet M. Powers at 337

Three die in Seton Hall dorm fire

by Robert Ingrassia, Ralph
R. Ortega and Patrice
O'Shaughnevsy
Knight-Ridder Tribune
SOUTH ORANGE, N.J.
— Screams drowned out the
fire alarm, choking smoke filled
the halls and flames shot
through a Seton Hall Univer
sity dormitory early Thursday
as hundreds of freshmen fled

in terror.
One girl plunged through
a wall of flame at her door, and
at least two students leaped
from windows to escape a blaze
that left three male students
dead and 58 people injured.
The fire, whose cause had
not been determined, origi
nated in a sofa in a third-floor
lounge in Boland Hall on the
South Orange, N.J., college
campus at 4:30 a.m., forcing
coatless students into frigid
darkness.
"The screams we heard
could have been some of the
people dying," said Greg
Edwards, 18, of Valley Stream,
L.I. "I'll never forget the
screams. It was the worst thing
I've ever heard."
A recent spate of false
alarms led many students at the
Catholic college to ignore the
warning at first.

"When people came out
with black stuff on their faces
and yelling, 'Help me! Help
me! ' — that's when reality set
in," said 18-year-old Vanessa
Gomez.
Lisa Sepulveda, 18, of
New York City, said she passed
a burned young man moaning
as she fled the residence hall.
"He looked like he had painted
his entire body; it was purple
and blue and orange."
The dead victims were all
18, from New Jersey and third
floor residents of Boland, a
freshman dorm. They were
identified as Frank Caltabilota
of West Long Branch, John
Giunta of Vineland and Aaron

Karol of Dunellen.
Frantic parents rushed to
the college to find their chil
dren, 18-and _19year-olds who
seemed much younger as they
stood crying in pajamas, hug
ging their mothers and fathers.
The blaze apparently
started in the third-floor lounge
in the north
wing of the 600- _OMBM
student dorm, x _$Sjip>_N

complete,"

Campolo said.
Two of the dead were
found in the lounge; they may
have tried to put the fire out,
authorities said. The three so
fas in that room were just
charred frames; the hallway
was blackened by soot. Dorm
room doors left open by flee
ing students revealed normalcy
— computers, books and
sneakers — juxtaposed with

the horrific scene.
The third victim was
found in a nearby room; emer
gency personnel had attempted
to revive him, said Campolo.
"I actually went back to
sleep after I heard the alarm,
and my roommate had to wake
me up and tell me it was real,"

said Pete Tornatore, 18, of
Manalapan, N.J.
"It could have been us,"
said George Kelly, 18, of Wild
wood N.J., hugging his girl
friend who was clad in Winnie
the-Pooh slippers. "This was a
total reality check."
Resident assistants went
from room to room banging on
doors to get the students out.
Firefighters guided other stu¬

dents out by crawling with
them, forming human chains.
Later, students — who
12 hours before had celebrated
the Seton Hall Pirates' upset
win over the St. John's basket
ball team — milled around the
student center adjacent to
Boland Hall, some crying,

cause of uncertainty about
whether they were in working
order. The residence had 55 fire

some shock, most
exhausted from grief
and relief.
Besides
being plagued
by 18 false
alarms since
September —
including
seven times
during finals
week of the
fall semester
— the dorm
had no sprin
kler system.
Sprinklers
were not re
quired when
it was built in
1971, offi
cials said.

Also,
fire hoses in
the building
had been dis
connected
from the
standpipe sys
tem, but
Campolo said
firefighters
wouldn't
have used
those "obso
lete" hoses
anyway be-

extinguishers; at least one of
them was used in the blaze.
Forty-two of the injured
were treated at area hospitals
and released. Of the remaining
16, at least three were in criti
cal condition.
The blaze was extin
guished quickly. Firefighters
searched rooms to account for
all the residents.
One student apparently
slept through the whole thing.
He was found in his room in
the dorm at 1:30 p.m. after his
parents inquired about him.
Classes and other activi
ties have been suspended at
least through Sunday. Boland
Hall will reopen today so stu
dents can retrieve their belong
ings.

On January 19, an over
flow crowd of hundreds of stu
dents attended a solemn, half
hour memorial Mass at Im
maculate Conception Chapel,
just across a field from the fire
ravaged dorm. Hundreds of
other grieving students waited
outside the stone chapel.
"It was a great thing for
everyone to come together,"
said Tncia Santiago, 21, a se
nior. "That's what helps."
Mourners walked out of
the chapel arm-in-arm, and sev
eral wiped away tears.
"We just prayed for the
dead and those that were in
jured," said Maria Stratigis, 19,
a freshman from Fort Lee, N.J.
Back at the dorm, the
building's exterior displayed
nothing of the day's deadly
drama. Its pale exterior walls
weren't charred; the icy an had
erased the odor of smoke.

But bouquets of red roses
and white carnations were laid
at the entrance in lemem
brance.

Winter water woes

By Kristine Meier
Staff Writer
On Thursday, January 20
a water pipe broke in the pan
try of the Alpha Chi Ro resi

dence. The freezing tempera
ture made the pipes too cold
and due to the lack of a heat
ing system in the kitchen, the
water pipe broke at a T joint.
Anyone who was taking a
shower or using water lost it,

as it was shut off to stop the
pipe from leaking. No serious
consequences occurred due to
the breakage. To fix the bro

How to meet first years and register early

by Allison Small
Staff Reporter
Last year, Annalisa DeBacco saw
a poster that caught her attention. The
poster called for volunteers to work as
orientation leaders during the fall of
1999. Annalisa, then a first-year stu
dent, decided to pursue the activity. "I
wanted to get more involved on cam
pus, and I thought it would be a great
way to meet people. I wanted to help
the first-year students get to know
Gettysburg!"
This month, the Orientation
Committee seeks 65 volunteers to fill
next year's Orientation positions. Ac
cording to Chairperson Cara Masucci,
orientation leaders "should be open,
honest, have a deep desire to help first
year students and know about the work
ings of the college. OLs need to be
friendly because many new students will
be shy and nervous about coming to

Gettysburg College."
Those who wish to volunteer as
orientation leaders should also prepare
to work hard. After the committee se
lects leaders and alternate leaders, the
students attend one spring meeting.
Before school begins in August, they
train for about four days. They role
play, learn methods to handle various
situations and meet with residence life
staff members to "ensure a high rate of
success at keeping first year students and
transfers on target." According to
Annalisa, "It was time consuming, but
a lot of fun. We trained before the [stu
dents] got here, and once they arrived
it was pretty busy."
The Orientation program started
several years ago and has developed
with increasing support from faculty
members. Bob Nordvall, Dean of First
Year Students, runs the Orientation
Committee. Members of the Residence
Life staff, of Dining Services, and of the
First Year Advising staff also belong to

the committee. Masucci says, "the door
is always open to change. We even ask
perspective OLs for their input when
we interview them. We take this input
seriously. For instance, someone sug
gested that we devise a scavenger hunt
for last semester's program. Although
there were a few glitches, overall the
idea was wonderful."
The program, however, does
present various challenges. "It's tough
to work with a group of people that you
don't know because they all have such
unique personalities. There is, however,
a certain point at which everything
clicks and you really feel as though you
have done something good. For any
one who is nervous about how to handle
problems, the training program helps,"
says Masucci.
Masucci says that orientation
leaders will feel glad that they belong
to the program. In addition to helping
new students, "we have lots of benefits
for OLs. First, they can register early,

which is always a plus. Secondly, they
get an awesome shirt, get fed for a week,
and [boost] their resumes." Masucci
also says that she met some of her clos
est friends as she volunteered as an ori
entation leader during her sophomore
year. As for Annalisa, she has main
tained several friendships that began
during her stint as an orientation leader.
"We see each other around campus. I'd
love to get together as a whole group
again, too." She hopes to work on the
Orientation staff again next semester.
"[It was] definitely worth it. I already
have my application filled out," she
says. Applications will remain at the
CUB desk until February 4th, and in
terested students may complete and
deliver them to the Academic Advising
office by this date. Anyone who seeks
more information should contact Cara
Masucci at x7259.

Ugandan refugee plays the Junction

From Staff Reports
At noon in the Junction on Feb
ruary 2, Ugandan musician Samite will
perform. He will also be presenting a
workshop focusing on his experiences
as a refugee at 2:15 in the Junction.
These events are sponsored by the Of
fice of Student Activities and the Inter
cultural Resource Center.
Samite's music first and foremost
celebrates and preserves his native
Baganda culture: his vocals are sung
entirely in Luganda, his mother tongue,
and the songs are performed on tradi
tional African instruments such as
kalimba (finger piano), marimba
(wooden xylophone), htungu (seven
stringed Kenyan instrument) and flutes.
But with the addition of modern tech
nology and a touch of Western jazz,
Samite seamlessly merges the traditional
with the contemporary, resulting in a
fascinating, unique and highly accessible
fusion.

Samite was born and raised in
Uganda, where his grandfather taught
him to play the traditional flute. His
primary schooling was within the King's
Courtyard, where the royal musicians

played for the king. That daily influ
ence permanently instilled within the
young boy the rhythms and patterns of
the traditional music of his people. Rec
ognizing his talents, a teacher at his high
school in Kampala put a western flute
in his hands and helped him to become
one of the most highly acclaimed flut
ists in East Africa.
In 1982, he fled to Kenya as a
political refugee, where he played with
the Bacchus Club Jazz Band and the
renowned African Heritage Band. In
creasingly drawn to instruments and
rhythms from the traditional Ugandan

music scene, he began playing his own
music at the Mount Kenya Safari Club
in Nairobi.
Emigrating to the United States in
1987, Samite made his home in Ithaca,
New York, where he recorded his first
tour de force Shanachie release, Abaana
Bakesa (Dance My Children, Dance).
His second release was Pearl of Africa
Reborn (Shanachie) and his third re
lease, Sihna Musango (Xenophile),
reached #2 on the CMJ New World
Music Charts in the summer of 1996.
Samite's fourth album, Stars to Share,
was released on Windham Hill in July
J 999 and features guest appearances by

Patti Cathcart, Phil Aaberg
and Will Ackerman.
In the summer of 1997,
Samite returned to Uganda
tor the first time m fifteen
years, a trip which was filmed
by documentary producer
Glenn Ivers. Along the way,
the two visited with refugees
from Liberia, Rwanda and
Uganda at various locations
in Africa. The result is the
PBS video Song of the Refu
gee, available through the
PBS satellite in January 1998.
Song of the Refugee tells the
true story of African refugees
and displaced peoples, and
conveys their optimism for
the future despite their har
rowing past.
For over ten years
Samite has made his living as
Uganda's unofficial musical
ambassador to the U.S. One
of his goals is to open
people's minds and hearts to

the common threads of human con
cerns, conveying optimism through sto
ries and song. Samite says, "I am con
vinced that we are all moved by the

same desires, needs and emotions re
gardless of the language in which those
feelings are expressed."

RPCs, DVDs and grouchincss

BY LIBBY MUSSELMAN
Dear Libby, I stopped by
the reference desk to sign up for
a Research Paper Consultation,
and the librarian told me there
weren't any until February 21.
Why not? I want to get started
now. Jason Dear Jason, Libby is
thrilled to learn that there are
still students who start their
work early, and wants to assure
you that the reference librarians
DO plan to continue the popu
lar RPC program this semester.
They had 125 students sign up
last semester, so they know it is
a really popular service. They
wish they could do more. But
they also have other jobs to do
like helping people at the refer
ence desk, working on the
website and teaching research
classes.
When they took a look at
the statistics they saw that the
greatest demand for RPCs came

in the middle and end of the
semester, so that's when they
are planning to offer this ser
vice. If you want help now, just
stop by the reference desk and
talk to one of the librarians.
The desk is staffed 60 hours per
week: Monday -Friday 9:00 am
-5:00 PM, and Sunday - Thurs
day evenings 6:00 PM - 10:00
PM. Head of Reference Janelle
Wertzberger says "just drop by
and discuss your library re
search needs with whoever is on
duty. You can ask them any
thing! They're all really
friendly and they know a lot of
stuff. " And, you'll see a new
face at the desk this semester—
our newest librarian Wayne
Bivens-Tatum. Stop by and say
hi. Dear Libby, When is the
library going to start buying
DVDs. I got a player for Christ
mas. The library should get
with it. Cruisin' with my DVDs

Dear Cruisin , You re not
too observant, are you? Try cruis
ing to a Muscat terminal, pal.
There are at least 35 DVDs,
maybe more, available for you to
check out.
They are shelved at circu
lation and listed in the online
catalog. In fact, Libby makes it
easy. Muscat has a link which
says Videos and DVDs and if you
click on the button you get a
beautiful list, created by the cata
logers of all the DVDs available.
To check out a DVD, bring
the call number up to the circu
lation desk and we'll get it for
you. A DVD checks out for the
same period of time as a video.
Dear Libby, You were such
a grouch last semester. I hope
your disposition has improved
and that you got a nice long va
cation. Student observer
Dear Observer, Libby isn't
naturally a grouch but you have
to admit that there was an awful
lot of uncivilized behavior to deal

with last semester in the library—
vulgar graffiti, persons peeing in
the trash cans, stolen furniture,
Greek symbols carved in the el
evator, loud and mindless conver
sations on the emergency phones,
rudeness, noise in the quiet study
areas, food everywhere. If you
and your friends don't like
Libby's darts then don't act like
beasts.
Special Request: Libby asks
your support for our Dickinson
College colleague and fellow li
brarian Yongyi Song, who is im
prisoned in China because of his
scholarly research. On Christinas
Eve, Mr. Song was arrested in
China on charges of "the pur
chase and illegal provision of in
telligence to foreign people." Be
fore his arrest, he was held un
der investigation for four months
in a Chinese prison.
Mr. Song is a respected au
thor and researcher on the cul
tural revolution and was to be¬

come a U.S. citizen in September,
1999. Libby would like to ap¬

peal to all friends of higher edu
cation to protest the imprison
ment of this scholar and join the
effort for his release.
Click on the box in the
center of the library webpage at
http://www.gettysburg.edu/li
brary to sign Dickinson's peti
tion. The links on this page will
enable you to register your sup
port, not only for the release of
Mr. Song but for the freedom
to pursue academic research in
ternationally.
Hearts to the spectacular
staff and terrific student work
ers at Musselman Library who
kept the building open during
Tuesday's snowstorm. And
thanks to the Facilities staff who
came by regularly to shovel the
steps so that students could have
a place to work outside the resi
dence halls.

The speed of life

by Anne Schenck
Contributing Reviewer
James Gleick. Faster: The
Acceleration of Just About Ev
erything. $24.00.
Another winter break is
behind us, believe it or not.
Despite a full month off from
classes, it somehow seems like
we never left. Why is that?
Why is it that finals seem like
just yesterday or that when we
look back on our years here at
Gettysburg, we'll say they flew
by? From the author of the
much-acclaimed "Chaos: Mak
ing a New Science" comes an
explanation. According to
James Gleick_'s latest novel,
"Faster", our lives are in fast
forward, flying by us at incom
prehensible speeds, measured in
thousands and millionths of sec
onds. How can we not help but
feel rushed when nearly every
thing around us seems to be
speeding up? Athletes, e-mail,
food preparation, news report
ing, telephone dialing, even
movie editing, is moving faster
than ever before. Did you know
that television news sound bites
are a full 30 seconds shorter
than they were 40 years ago?
Or that the time an elevator
door remains open for passen¬

gers is usually only two to four
seconds? No one has time for
anything longer.
Chapter by chapter,
Gleick examines the impact of
time on humans today. Every
one is in a hurry: it is the de
fining quality of our time. If
you have any doubt, just watch
a couple of TV commercials
and note how many advertise
ments promise to save you
time. Picking up on this,
"Faster" probes into the aver
age American's life and with
humor and insight, extracts
those simple events and actions
which, in an effort to save time,
only lead us to feel hurried and
stressed. And beware
Gettysburg; studies have found
that those hurried and stressed
feelings increase with wealth
and education.

Faster is a good read.
Aware of today's shortening
attention spans, Gleick's writ
ing is clear and his chapters are
concise. So, with the seconds
you save speed-dialing, the
minutes you save by using a
microwave and the hours you
save using a computer, pick up
a copy of "Faster" and take
some of your free time to learn
about why the rush never stops.
It might just force you to sit
down and think.

Sample band Friday night

like Neil Young and the Beatles
more than the jam-band pre
decessors of their contempo
raries. The standard radio
fnendly formula has also never
especially appealed to the band
- the concise pop hooks and
folk-rocky rhythms stretch out
into extend jams and sonic ex
ploration, both in studio and
on stage.
In fact, it is the superb
stage performance that has
convinced fans to pick up on
what the media has missed.
Since 1992, The Samples an
nual show at Red Rocks
Ampitheater has been one of
that venue's largest events. In
1993, their appearance on The

From si ah- _reporis
On Friday, January 28,
the Office of Student Activities
and S.A.C. will present The
Samples. The doors open at 8
p.m. and tickets (with
Gettysburg College ID) are $8.
Tickets are on sale in the Col
lege Bookstore during normal
business hours for ID, credit
card charges and cash sales.
Comedian Tom Cotter will
open for the group.
The Samples consists of
Sean Kelly, Andy Sheldon, Rob
Somers, Alex Matson and Sam
Young. The group was formed
twelve years ago when Kelly
and Sheldon first played to
gether in Vermont, then moved
to Boulder, Colorado in 1987.
Kelly readily admits that
The Samples have not been sub
jected to the same amount of
limelight as some of their peers.
"Grassroots approaches
by other bands have been re
warded," says The Samples'
frontman, guitarist, lead vocal
ist and main songwriter, "and
we've been skipped over in
some sense."
For The Samples, this is
anything but a gripe. The band
is thrilled with its trailblazing
path among active musicians.
Through fighting to maintain
artistic integrity, The Samples
have created a unique sound
and continue to add to their
legions of dedicated fans, main
taining a successful career on
their own terms in a field with
phenomenal turnover. That the
band expresses ideas like these
should not be a surprise.
"Music made for the re
active buyer, anything that sac
rifices the proactive aspect of
the creative process, isn't worth
doing," says Kelly. "It speaks of
the sway held by the trend of
the moment, and the demand
in the industry for reactive mu
sic." The proof is in the music
- with eight full-length albums
and a five-song EP released over
the last decade, The Samples
have clearly refused to compro
mise their creative visions.
Then again, the band has always
embraced songwnting a little
differently from its shooting
star peers. Rock and pop melo
dies are mixed with elements of
ska and folk into a kaleido
scopic fusion that recalls acts

Tonight Show with Jay Lena
sparked a record number of
phone calls to the NBC switch
board regarding a musical
guest. The band has also shared
the stage with luminaries such
as Sting and Branford Marsalis,
both of whom have shown The
Samples how to maintain a
good perspective on their com
mercial arc.
"It's always looked at like
this band is in some sort of a
race," says Kelly. "But what if
we aren't in that race at all? I
don't know what it means to be
the band that never got their
day in their sun. Maybe we've
just been there all along."



Consider This....

A helpful word of advice from the association of inebriated
pedestrians: in hazardous conditions, the consumption of alco
holic beverages while walking anywhere on the College campus
is not recommended. Out of the 500,000 snow shovels made by
Wal-Mart annually, none of them, we repeat none of them, have
ever made it to Gettysburg College. Also under that heading are
snowblowers, icepicks, plows, and all other variations of snow
removal equipment.
That's right; even though the Pennsyl

Letter to the Editor

Should the school
colors be changed to
... money green?
Rig ht now I should be studying
for my 1:30 final. However, I
am so pissed off right now I can
only concentrate on venting my feel
ings. It seems once again our beautiful
college has found yet another way to
put the screws to their student body.
It's not bad enough that they
charge an arm and a leg for tuition, but
they are always looking for yet another
way to dip into our pockets. Don't get
me wrong, I love the $50.00 telecom
munications fee and $25.00 voice mail
fee just as much as the next guy, but

where does this stop?
My main purpose for writing this
letter is to praise the enormous amount
of leeway Gettysburg College offers
their students (note the sarcastic tone).
Today is Wednesday, December 15, the
peak of finals week. Everyone is
slammed with enormous amounts of
pressure from finals. No one is con
centrating on anything but study and
sleep schedules. We are all worried
about how our final grades will affect
our future, however, Gettysburg Col
lege still deems it necessary to maintain
strict parking regulations.

Would it kill you to cut us a little
slack three days away from the closing
of school? Are parking violations re
ally that high of a priority right now?
I pulled into the lot behind
Glatfelter this morning for my 8:30
exam and noticed there were no more
spots in the generous three rows of spots

allotted for the students. The five rows
of spots allotted for the professors,
which are generally never full, had at
most two rows of cars. Being pressured
for time, I parked in a vacant spot in
the last row of the "teacher" spaces.
Upon completion of my exam,
which was around 10:00,1 was greeted
at my car by a $20.00 ticket. This pissed
me off, but what made me decide to
write this letter was when I looked
down at the time of the ticket. I re
ceived this ticket at 8:30 a.m. What a
coincidence. How convenient. All of
the "parking criminals" are now break
ing the points off of their #2's.
If I had to take a random guess, I
would assume the next wave of law
enforcement will occur at 1:30 p.m. I'm
sure I am not the only one who feels
this way. All I ask is that we be cut a
break. I don't think it would break the
bank if Gettysburg College decided not
to distribute fines during the last few,
final filled, days of school.

One final thought: if Gettysburg
College is dead set on distributing such
trivial fines the last week of the semes
ter, I would be a lot less bitter having
my fine money donated to charity,
rather then falling into Gettysburg's
bottomless pockets. I propose that the
College donate all fines distributed this
close to the end of the semester to ran
dom charities.
If anyone else agrees with me
please write the College a letter express
ing your opinion and your favorite char
ity. Let's see how generous our Col
lege really is.
Sincerely,
Zander Polis '02

Recess to safe abortion hangs in balance

by Rachel Hanson
Columnist
Recently, the United
States Supreme Court agreed to
rule on two very important
cases related to abortion and
women's reproductive choices.
The Court has not made a ma
jor ruling on abortion rights
since Planned Parenthood of
Southeastern Pennsylvania v.
Casey in 1992, where Roe v.
Wade was fundamentally reaf¬

firmed, though with some new
limitations.
Late term abortions,
which have been incorrectly
dubbed "partial birth abor
tions" by anti-choice people, is
one of the issues that the Su
preme Court has agreed to take
on. Since 1995, 30 states have
enacted laws banning late term
abortions. Last September, a
federal appeals court struck
down such laws in Nebraska,
Iowa, and Arkansas because the

laws were too vague and could
potentially include a number of
other abortion procedures.
However, just one month
later, another federal appeals
court upheld similar laws in
Wisconsin and Illinois, saying
that the laws could be narrowly
enforced. The conflict between
the two federal appeals courts
virtually forced the Supreme
Court to take on the issue.
The Supreme Court has
also decided to rule on a 1993
Colorado "bubble" law, which
bars abortion protestors from
counseling, distributing leaf
lets, or displaying signs within
eight feet of clinic patients
without their consent and must
remain at least 100 feet from
the entrance to a clinic. Those
who violate the law can be
jailed for up to six months and
receive a fine of $750.

The Supreme Court ruled
in a similar New York case in
1997 that abortion protestors
could confront patients on

sidewalks as long as they re
main at least 15 feet from the
clinic's entrance.
Late term abortions have
been the subject of much de
bate over the past few years.
Those who are anti-choice have
turned a medical procedure,
dilation and extraction, into a
ploy used by their camp to fur
ther demonize abortion and
criminalize providers.
Bans on late term abor
tions are a blatant attack on a
woman's right to choose. Kate
Michelman, president of the
National Abortion and Repro
ductive Rights Action League,
says of the bans, "They
threaten women's rights to re
productive freedom and
choice."

It is important to realize
that late term abortions are per
formed very rarely. In a lec
ture she gave in 1998 here at
Gettysburg, Karen O'Connor,
author of Abortion: No Neu
tral Ground?, noted that there

is only one doctor in the na
tion who performs late term
abortions. Even those in favor
of the bans realize this. Ne
braska Attorney General Don
Stenberg, who is defending his
state's ban, noted that late term
abortions are "a relatively little
used ...procedure."
A ban on late term abor
tions is not necessary and will
benefit no one. Since they are
so rare and a provider is so hard
to come by, a ban would hurt
women by accomplishing noth
ing but a start in the diminish
ing of other rights women have
in obtaining an abortion.
Limiting the access of
protestors to patients and clin
ics is also a very important is
sue in women's freedom of
choice. Contrary to popular
belief, women do not wake up
one day and decide to get preg
nant, simply to be able to have
the experience of an abortion.
The decision to have an abor¬

is not an easy one or one

that is taken lightly. Many lives
are affected by unexpected
pregnancies, and most women
take these into consideration
when deciding whether to have
an abortion.
Women who have made
the difficult decision to have an
abortion do not need strangers
harassing them as they enter a
medical clinic. The last thing
they really need is someone in
vading their privacy and throw
ing untrue and misleading
"facts" at them. And they cer
tainly do not need someone
who knows nothing of their
lives and situations telling them
what a terrible person they are
for making the decision that
best suits them.
Hopefully the Supreme
Court will decide to protect a
woman's right to abortion ac
cess and a safe environment
when entering a clinic. If not,
it could lead to the beginning
of the end of safe and legal
abortions in America.

Justice or tyranny? The case of Elian Gonzalez

by Dan Ballentyne
Columnist
Around Thanksgiving of
1999, a mother, grandmother,
and six-year-old son fled the
communist dictatorship of
Cuba on a flimsy boat in an at
tempt to reach the great free
dom offered by the United
States. Sadly, the mother and
grandmother died en route.
However, the boy had family
waiting for him in Miami, and
he went to live with them.
If you have not realized
it yet, this is the story of little
Elian Gonzalez. What hap
pened after he came to the
United States is well known.
He has become the rope in an
international tug of war be
tween the democratic United
States and the communist re
gime in Cuba.

This places the United
States in the position of decid
ing whether or not to send little
Elian Gonzalez back to Castro's
tyranny in Cuba. This is a dif
ficult decision to make. On the
one hand are the bonds of fam
ily, and on the other is the fact
that to support the bonds of
family we must send the boy
back to the evil and tyrannical
regime in Cuba.
However, in the interest
of justice and human decency
we should not send that little
boy back to Cuba. I say this
for several reasons. First, he
will have a much better life in
the United States than in Cuba.
Second, his mother died to
bring him to this county. Fi
nally, the principle involved can
not be ignored.
It is very clear that Elian
will have a much better life in
the United States. Look at the

conditions in Cuba. The
economy has been in absolutely
terrible shape. They are moni
tored by secret police. Execu
tions for no legitimate reason
are common. They do not en
joy the freedoms guaranteed to
us by the constitution.
In Cuba, Elian would es
sentially be left to a life of pov
erty and oppression. Compare
that to what he will experience
in the United States.
He will have a family that
loves him and freedom. He
will enjoy the prosperity of the
United States. His educational
options are not just vast but
actually in existence, as op
posed to state-run ideological
indoctrination center in Cuba.
He will be able to speak
his mind without fear, worship
in the religion of his choice,
and own a gun, among other
freedoms that we enioy. He

will live under the rule of law
and not the rule of Castro. He
will clearly have a better life
here. If Elian's mother died to
bring her son to freedom,
shouldn't her wishes be re
spected? Furthermore, how
can we be sure what the father's
wishes are? He lives in a ty
rannical regime that is infa
mous for its persecutions of
political prisoners, and in Cuba
a political opponent is anyone
who does not spout the Com
munist Party line.
Also, factor in reports
that the father agreed with the
mother and was planning on
fleeing with his current family
at a later date. It is very much
in the realm of possibility that
the father is not saying what he
really feels and is saying it un
der duress.
Finally, there is a prin¬

ciple here. One of the basic
American benchmark prin
ciples is to spread freedom to
all peoples. Is not Elian
Gonzalez a person? Does he
not deserve the freedom we
enjoy? Of course he does. In
fact, I think this whole point
can be summed up this way: we
wouldn't send a boy back to
Hitler or Stalin, so we should
not send one to Castro.
I am very much a pro
family conservative. I am also
a devout antiCommunist. This
is a difficult call. But I feel that
he must stay here. He is not
an orphan, he has family here
that is taking care of him.
His quality of life has the
potential to be better here. The
answer to the question of what
is in the best interests of little
Elian Gonzalez is that he
should stay in the United States.

Don't ask don't tell: who said what

by Christina Dickfri
Political Columnis r
Many of our presidential
candidates have taken advan
tage of being seen with men
and women who serve our
country in the military. The
photos are spread over the
evening news, showing the
compassion and respect that
candidates hold for men and
women in uniform.
On Veterans Day, there
wasn't a candidate on either
side that didn't use the oppor
tunity to talk with veterans and
thank them for preserving de
mocracy. Many _candidates also
refer to their own time served
in the military, and the press
frowns upon those candidates
who chose not to serve.
The military was a tocal
point of the many presidential
debates that occurred over

Christmas break. The candi
dates were not talking about
defense spending or the latest
technology. Instead, they were
interested in the debate over
ending the "don't ask, don't
tell" policy that has dominated
sexual preference policy in the
armed forces.
President Clinton made
waves in his first term when he
pursued an "open" policy, en
couraging the military to put
aside the ban on homosexuals
in the military. Instead, Con
gress shot it down, and the
"don't ask, don't tell" policy
that the United States upholds
today was created by a compro¬

. Now, almost a decade af
tei it was put into practice, the
"don't ask, don't tell" policy is
becoming ineffective. Homo
sexual soldiers are still subject
to harassment and teasing,
some of which has crossed the
me into criminal action.
On July 5, 1999, Private
Fust Class Barry Wmchell
was bludgeoned to death in
his Fort Campbell, Kentucky
army barracks. In previous
weeks, he had been the ob
ject of much teasing and ha
rassment from other privates
because he was rumored to
be gay. A fellow private was
sentenced to life in prison in
December for Private
_WinchelPs murder.

Incidents such as this
demonstrate that the "don't
ask, don't tell" policy is in
effective. A few months ago,
Defense Secretary William
Cohen actually called for a
review and a revision of the
policy.
A few weeks ago, on
January 12, the United King
dom lifted its ban on homo
sexuals in the military. The
pressure on the United States
to do the same is as unbear
able as ever.
Republican candidates
for president have agreed
that the "don't ask, don't
tell" policy would be upheld
if any of them were to be
elected president. The front
runner, George W. Bush,

stated in Decembei that he
thinks that the "don't ask,
don't tell" policy is perfect for
America in the 21st century.
Only one Republican
candidate, Alan Keyes, has
called for the total abolishment
of this policy, m order to re
place it with its predecessor:
the total ban on homosexuals
in the military. The Republi
can candidates who continue to
advocate that the people who
offer to lay down their lives for
this country cannot be open
about their sexual preference,
are not ready to be the leader
of the most powerful country
in the world. They cannot lead
us into the 21st century while

upholding archaic policies.
On the Democratic side
of things, the "don't ask, don't
tell" policy has been the coi
nei stone ot one of the debates
before the primaries On Janu
ary 5, in Durham, New Hamp
shire, Al Gore and Bill Bradley
were asked if they would make
a litmus test compulsory foi
any nominee to the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, which would
then determine then tolerance
of gays in the military. The
point of the litmus test is to
have the nominees agree to
carry out orders of the abolish
ment of "don't ask, don't tell"
and fully integrate homosexu
als into the military.

Bill Bradley had already
stated his position on "don't
ask, don't tell" in September
when he called for the total
elimination of the policy. He
stood by his policy earlier this
month when he called the lit
mus test a waste of time. As
commander in chief, Bradley
would expect his orders to be
followed by the military, and
these would include full inte
gration. Obviously, Bradley
has made up his mind on this
topic and is ready to stand by
his decision.
As for Al Gore, that is a
totally different story. Before
Winchell's death in July, Gore
promised to uphold "the policy
with more compassion," but

the Pachyderm's Pulpit
Media favors McCain, but
should Republicans?

by J ohn Duni ai_>
poiiiicai coiumnisi
While seven of the major
presidential candidates were
fighting it out in Iowa last week
to finish near the top spot in
the Iowa Caucus, Mr. "I am
different" John McCain had to
be different The Arizona sena
tor decided that he did not have
the time nor resources to cam
paign effectively against Gov
ernor George W. Bush's oiga
nization and campaign wai
chest in both Iowa and New
Hampshire, so Senator McCain

has instead focused his atten
tion ]ust on New Hampshire.
In a paity that tartly
nominates anyone but the
rrontrunner for president, this
may be a wise strategy. Sena
roi Ernest Holhngs of South
Carolina attempted this on the
Democratic side to very little
avail in 1984, but it seems to
be serving McCain very well so
fai. Polls in New Hampshire,
the crucial first in the nation
primary, have the Senator beat
ing Governor Bush and ahead
of all the other competition.

Forbes, Alan Keyes, and Gary
Bauer polled a combined 53%
of the vote in Iowa.
John McCain's biggest
support lies outside of the Re
publican Party, which says a lot
for the things he stands for. It
is so sad to see, aftei the presi
dency of Ronald Reagan, a
major Republican stand for a
tax cut whose size competes
with Al Gore's. During the
19S0's, President Reagan gave
us across the board tax reduc
tions that resulted m the long
est period of economic growth
in our histor>. The growth that
began undei Reagan is still con
tinuing.
While Bill Clinton and Al
Ctoh j would h_,i\e you believe

that the national budget defi
cit ballooned in the eighties
because of the president, the
fact is that revenues tripled
during the Reagan piesidency.
The problem was that spend
ing was never brought under
control. President Clinton and
the Republican Congress
elected in 1994 followed the
Reagan formula to balance the
budget. With rising revenues,
they reduced the rate of growth
in government spending and
that is what balanced the bud
get. If we can continue the
growth that is underway by
cutting taxes, as Governor Bush
wants to do, then we can raise
revenue and pay down the na
hnn. il debt.

It is John McCain's hope,
and only hope I might add, that
he will beat Bush in New
Hampshire and then follow up
with a strong showing in South
Carolina. South Carolina has
the largest percentage of veter
ans in the nation, a group to
whom McCain, a former Viet
nam War POW, appeals. From
South Carolina, with a lot of
momentum, McCain can
topple the governor of Texas.
Perhaps another reason
that John McCain skipped out
on Iowa was that unlike New
Hampshire where Indepen
dents can vote in the Republi
can Primary and South Caro
lina where anyone can vote in
the GOP primary, in Iowa, only
the hardcore members of the
party come out to cast their
ballot at the caucus. This was
a key reason that the combined
votes of candidates to the right
of George W. Bush: Steve

Senator McCain trvists
Washington to keep most of the
surplus, where it will be spent.
Now that we have balanced the
budget we cannot make the
same mistake that we have in
the past by keeping the money
in Washington. It should be
returned to the people to allow
the economy to grow. Senator
McCain must think the public
will not spend the money. Tax
cuts will foster economic
growth, in the investment
economy it will be invested and
returned to the government in
the form of tax revenues.

A PORTRAIT OF THE COLUMNIST AS A YOUNG MAN

by la. isherwood
Social Commentator
So I hope that you are all
back and readjusted for another
grand semester here at Gettys
burg. For some, this will mark
the end of a college career, but
most of you have many more
semesters in all of their splen
dor to look forward to. As for
me, providing that I pass my
classes, I am long gone with 1 _: : i : : ' 1

Chapter Two: Lord
only the distant memory of my
youth left behind. There will
be more on that sort of thing
later, I can assure you, but there
is no need for melancholy now.
In fact there is talk of the
senior crisis, which affects
many of us as we go out and
try to make the world a little
bit better. Personally I have no
faith that I can make anything
better, so the only crisis I have
to look forward to is when my
parents tell me that two years

of the Flies revisited
of sitting on their couch is too
long and I need a job. At least
I have a couple years until that
pivotal moment.
I have decided to give my
recommendations for the cam-
pus community to make our
little bubble a little bit better.
In light of the recent "blizzard"
which has hit this community
harder than the Y2K bug ever ;
could, I have a simple little i
remedy. If you plow the snow,
then people can drive. If (
people can drive, then kids can
go to school. If kids go to ; t

school, then the world becomes
a better-educated and more
open-minded place for all.
I am not saying that the
snow day wasn't a nice break
(from those three strenuous
days of class) but it seems that
none of the 1,000,000 pounds
of salt PennDot was bragging
about made it to Adams
County. In addition, Lincoln
Square became "the circle of
death" for any motorist who
dared to slam on their breaks
in the middle of the road. It's
snow, and you can drive on it.
I recommend slowly, but it is
not an impossibility.

So does anyone remem
ber the first day of Servo this
semester? You all should be
cause every one of you con
verged on that tiny little din
ing center at exactly the same
time, leaving the workers near
tears. I have never seen it so
full, and honestly it was trau
matizing even trying to get in
line for my hamburger. One
tip - talk at your freaking tables
and not right in front of the
salad bar.
I was about to offer a
bounty for the person who was
able to take out the most
people who were just standing
around catching up on "who
hooked up with who" over
break. I dealt with my family,
watched some TV, caught up on
some reading, and worked a
little. That's it. Oh yeah, New
Year's was fun but the next day
wasn't, end of story.

\ We should all be required
to wear it on a sandwich board
the first day. I don't care how
we talk about it; just don't do
it in the middle of the dining
hall. That's the kind of behav
ior that starts riots and I won't
have anyone's blood on my
hands!
So I was talking to friends
about what possible solution
we could come to concerning
the Servo dilemma. It was de
cided, by unanimous consent,
hat the best option facing the
administration is to not grant
meal plans to first year students
next year. Seriously, hear me
out. As an institution of higher
learning, and a residential com
munity, we want to encourage
valuable life skills and indepen
dence needed later in life. In
addition, we want to modify
and solidify the first year ex
perience. It is even in accor
dance with the new social
policy.

So what will this create?
When freshmen arrive on cam
pus, their RA's will attach to the
name cards on their respective
doors the title of "Hunter" or
"Gatherer". Within their par
ticular societal roles, each per
son will perform their various
duties in order to survive. The
Anthropology Department
would never again have to do
research outside of Gettysburg
as hordes of first year "vandals"
turn the quad into a virtual
Lord of the Flies.
Stipe Lake would be alive
with bonfires as pagan rituals
took place. In addition, we
never would have a squirrel
problem on campus again. We
would also have to close down
Pizza House if this was to suc
ceed.

If Bill Gates comes up
with another moneymaking
scheme to top Y2K, new Get
tysburg College students would
all be prepared for it. Listen
from a guy who knows, there
is nothing more satisfying than
wearing a tunic made out of
slaughtered rodents.

Debate
continued from page 11

did not mention the abandon
ment of the "don't ask, don't
tell" policy. In December, Gore
backtracked, saying that the
policy is ineffective and it
should be eliminated, but only
after Bradley and President and
Mrs. Clinton all spoke out
against the policy.
The President was apolo
getic when he said that the
policy was never implemented
as it was intended.
At the January 5 debate,
Gore said that it would be nec
essary for any nominees to the
Joint Chiefs of Staff to uphold
his new policy of allowing gays
to serve freely in the military,
and that a litmus test would be
required. Gore soon became
the target of criticism from the
military and other politicians
for his statement.

Two days later, on Janu
ary 7, Gore said that his state
ment at the debate was miscon
strued and that he did not in
tend to "inquire into the per
sonal political opinions of of
ficers in the U.S. military." In
stead, he borrowed Bill
Bradley's strong statement, and
said that he would not tolerate
his orders not being followed
as commander in chief.
Many Gore supporters
are dismissing his January 5
statement as "campaign talk,"
and feel that Gore is just say
ing what the American people

want to hear. They believe that
if he is elected president, his
rhetoric will change, and that
he will support the integration
of homosexuals in the military
without a litmus test for his
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
As a citizen and a voter, I
am not easily convinced. Why
can't Al Gore say what he truly
means? Why should voters
have to read between the lines
of the statements of a man who
truly does not know what he
stands for?
In the past six months, Al
Gore has changed his position
on the "don't ask, don't tell"
controversy three different
times. I personally do not want
a Democratic candidate who
has to constantly "clarify" and
"explain what he meant."

I admire Bui Bradley's
bluntness and aggressiveness in
stating and standing behind his
positions on policy issues. We
do not need a weakminded
candidate, let alone president.
Keep that in mind when you
watch the primaries during the
next few weeks and when you
are voting.
Do we want a wishy
washy candidate who is stuck
in the shadows of his predeces
sor or do we want a candidate
who is bold enough to step out
on his own? With the beauty
of American politics, you will
be the ones who decide.

McCain

- continued from page 11 -
Instead, John McCain is
playing class warfare. He
wants tax cuts to be targeted
to lower income groups. What
should happen, however, is that
we need a broad based tax cut
like the Bush plan which will
allow for new jobs to be cre
ated. That is what will lift the
poor, not simple tax rebates
such as Senator McCain is of
fering.
Tax cuts are only one is
sue where John McCain is

wrong. On campaign finance,
it was sad to see him quoting
the most liberal member of the
Supreme Court, Justice John
Paul Stevens. The problem to
day with campaign finance is
that the limits are too low, can
didates have to spend all of
their time raising money. With
increased limits candidates
could focus more on campaign
ing with real voters rather than
donors, campaign donation
limits could be adjusted for in
flation.

John McCain's plan
would abolish soft money.
While this may sound good, it
would allow the unions to blast
Republicans and the GOP
would not have the resources
to respond. The McCain
Feingold plan goes too far in
some areas and not far enough
in others. It is no surprise that
McCain is the only Republican
Senator who supports it.
George W. Bush's main
problem is that while he may
have won the Iowa Caucus,
that victory does not compare
to the national media primary
that Senator McCain has al
ready won. The liberal press
loves John McCain and hope
fully the voters in the Republi
can primaries will be able to see
through it.





Women's Basketball hits slump over winter break

From Siaii Ri-poris
Aftei jumping out to a 7
1 start, the women's basketball
team hit a slump over Christ
mas break. The following is a
summary of their winter break
games:
The women ended the
first semester in style, trounc
ing Goucher 77-41. Freshman
bruiser Jay Hodge finished with
a workwoman-like 16 points
and 16 rebounds.
Senior sharpshooter Car
rie Kulp added 13 points and
sophomore point guard Mandy
Wilson dished out nine assists
for the Lady Bullets as they
pushed their record to 8-1.
Following a four-week
layoff, Gettysburg returned to
action, hosting the Days Inn
Tournament. Despite Kulp's 14
points and Jamie Dawson's
double-double (11 points, 10
rebounds), the Lady Bullets fell
to Montclair State in the

opener.
The loss matched Gettys
burg against Susquehanna Uni
versity in the consolation game
the next day. At halftime, the
teams were knotted at thirty.
The Lady Bullets appeared to
take control in the second half,
starting with a 10-3 run.
But the Crusaders an-

sweied back, ending the game
with a 35-9 iiin, handing Get
tysbuig a 68-49 loss. Senioi
swing playei Megan McDonald
led the team with J 1 points,
while added ten
and team-best
while Dawson a
points and a _teai

seven rebounds.
Unhappy with
the outcome of
the tournament, _^^

Mike |p
Kirkpatrick _Ai
decided to {[ /
shuffle the \A
deck with \\J
four new _^
starters when \

Gettysburg re- ^\^
turned to confer- ^^
enc.e action at
Muhlenberg. The ex
periment failed, however,
as Muhlenberg jumped out
to a 16-2 advantage.
The Lady Bullets
stormed back behind Kulp's

hot shooting and went into
the intermission with a 28
24 lead. The game seesawed in
the second half, with neither
team enjoying a lead greater
than four.
Trailing 47-44 with ten
seconds remaining, sophomore
Kelsey Williams nailed a corner
three to force the game into
overtime.

51-51 deadlock. In the sec
ond overtime, it was all
Muhlenberg as they handed
Gettysburg their third straight
loss, 68-63.
Kulp scored a career
high 22 points in the loss and
Wilson recorded a career-best
seven steals, while playing all

I he teams each posted
four points in the hist o\ei
time puiod that ended in .1

48 minutes.
The women bounced back
tluee days latei with a convinc
ing 71-5S win ovei Franklin
& Marshall. The win ended
then three game slide and im
proved their record to 9-4,

. in the Centennial Con
feience. Kulp led the
_^ Lady Bullets, with
_^^ her second straight
_^7 22-point game.
/ / McDonald added
11 points and
Dawson recorded
her third double
double of the season
with 10 points and 10
boards.
Their excitement
was short-lived, how
ever, with a disappoint
ing conference loss at
Western Maryland. Get-

tysbuig led 44-_^4 with 1111
lemainmg, but the Gieen Tei
101 finished the game with a
31-H inn to win 65-52. Insult
was added to injury when
McDonald \vent down with a
severely sprained ankle.
Wilson scored a season
high 1 1 points while Jamie
Dawson added eight points and
a cai eei-high 12 rebounds foi
Gettysbuig.
McDonald is the second
starter coach Kirkpatrick has
seen fall out of the starting
lineup due to injury. Sopho
more Steph Drevna missed
much of winter break nursing
shin splints.
With nine games remain
ing, the women find themselves
in third place in the Centennial
Conference West division.
They are two games behind sec
ond-place Franklin tk.

Bullets Fly Faster Than Eagles
record in the 200 breast

by-Molly Clark
Staff Writer
The Gettysburg men's
and women's swim teams de
feated Mary Washington Col
lege this past weekend before
a full house at the CUB Pool.
The women dug deep to
defeat a fast Eagles squad in a
nailbiter, 105-100 win, while
the men's team had an easier
time, winning 165-49.
The meet was the first
since the teams' return from
a tiring ten day training trip
to Barbados. While in Barba
dos the teams trained twice a
day in the pool, as well tak
ing training swims in the
ocean and running on the
beach. Overall, it was a very
positive and beneficial trip
that brought the teams closer

together.
Despite fending off fa
tigue from the training trip and
suffering from a number of ill
nesses and injuries, the teams
managed a win in their biggest
meet of the season to date.
The women's team has
not lost a meet since the 1996
97 campaign and were confi
dent as they entered the second
half of the season.
Sophomore swimmer
Meredith Doviak said, "Going
into the meet we knew they
were going to be tough com
petition. But we were confi
dent in our abilities and we
knew that all our training
would pay off and put us on
top." Stellar performances
were turned in by junior Missy
West and senior Kelly Brennan.
West broke her own pool

while senior Kelly Brennan
managed a "B" cut qualify
ing time for the NCAA
championships.
The men's team did
not anticipate as close a
meet as the women, and
they were proved correct in
their assumptions.
Of the meet, sopho
more Craig Wilson said, "I
thought that our team as a
whole looked stronger than
I expected coming off our
training trip. The payoff of
our training trip could be
seen by the strong times
posted along with a few ex
ceptional times on both
teams."
The teams have an
other tough meet this Satur
day when they face strong
Swarthmore teams in Phila
delphia.

Trailing 46-44 with 12:52
remaining, the Bullets went on a
13-2 run to put the Dips away
for good. Napp erupted for a
career-high 27 points in the win.
Davidson scored 17 points and
grabbed a game high eight re
bounds. McNeil added 11.
Two nights later, the Bul
lets played host to the Alvernia
Crusaders in a non-conference
match up. Gettysburg used solid
defense and torrid shooting to
tally a 72-59 win, which was the
1000th in school history. Gettys
burg is one of only 38 division
III men's programs to reach the
milestone.
The Crusaders confused
the Bullets early with a 1-3-1
match up zone and as missed
shots piled up, Gettysburg found
themselves down eight.

But as the half wore on, the
men found some gaps in the zone
and back-toback three's by
McNeil toward the end of the
half gave the Bullets a 30-25 ad
vantage at the intermission. The
second half was all Gettysburg as
they answered every Alvernia

run. Davidson scored 20 of his
game-high 24 points in the half
to compliment his career-high 12
rebounds. Schreiber also re¬

corded a double-double, scor
ing 18 points and hauling in 11
boards. McNeil added 11 for
the Bullets, who pushed their
record to 8-6.
The win streak ended at
two in disappointing fashion as
the Bullets were upset by West
ern Maryland 72-68 in
Westminster. The Green Ter
ror, who entered the contest
winless in conference play, ben
efited from the sharp shooting
of Greg Hill. The freshman
guard was a perfect eight for
eight from behind the three
point arc. Schreiber was spec
tacular in defeat, scoring 24

points. Napp added 13.
The Bullets bounced back
from the loss with a thrilling
69-67 victory at Frostburg
State. Davidson and Napp
combined for 50 points as Get
tysburg improved their record
to 9-7, 2-3 in the conference.
Davidson posted his second
double-double of the week,
scoring a career-high 31 points
and pulling down 10 rebounds.
With eight games remain
ing, the Bullets find themselves
in the thick of the playoff race.
They trail F&M, Johns
Hopkins, and Dickinson by one
game in the Western division.

Thick in the playoff race, Bullets go 6-4 over break

From Staff Reports
The men's basketball team has
gone 6-4 since the last issue went to
print. The following is a summary of
their games spanning the winter break:
In the last game of the first semes
ter, the Bullets hosted the Ehzabethtown
Blue Jays in non-conference action.
Gettysburg never trailed in the contest
en route to a 74-62 victory.
Sophomore guard Curtis McNeil
scored 20 points in his first start of the
season, and classmate Terrance Callahan
scored a career-high 17, while dishing
out seven assists. Senior Rich Pfeil
posted a workmanlike double-double
with 11 points and 12 rebounds. The
win pushed the Bullets' record to 4-3
on the season.
After a week of finals, the men
traveled to Easton to battle division one
Patriot League power Lafayette. The
Bullets hung tough against the bigger,
stronger Leopards and trailed by just
three, 17-14, with 5:21 remaining in the
first half.

But the Bullets would get no
closer. A series of Lafayette three's fu
eled a 20-2 run to end the half, burying
the Bullets for good. Lafayette defeated
Gettysburg 82-52.
Freshman forward John Schnebly
led the Bullets with nine points on four
of eight shooting in his first action of
the season.
Following a short Christmas
break, Gettysburg traveled to Annapo
lis to play Navy, another division one
opponent. The Midshipmen jumped on

the Bullets early, staking an 18-4 advan
tage. But Gettysburg answered with a
14-5 run of their own to pull within
four. However, the Bullets would never
get closer and Navy eventually sailed
away to a 91-55 win.
McNeil led the Bullets with 11
points. Junior Greg Schreiber played
an outstanding floor game, scoring eight
points, pulling down six rebounds, and
handing out five assists.
The Bullets ended their two game
slide in a big way at the Moravian Grey
hound Classic. Sophomore Antoine
Gaither was inserted into the starting
lineup and came up big for the Bullets.
The "pass first" point guard kept his
troops organized on offense and both
ered Bullet opponents with his sticky
defense.
Gettysburg thumped Waynesburg
85-59 in the opener. Greg Schreiber
led four Bullets in double figures with
twelve points.
The win set up a championship
match up with host Moravian. The Bul
lets only trailed once in the contest, 5
3, and buried the Greyhounds with a
130 run en route to a 75-60 victory.

Senior forward and tournament
MVP Bill Davidson led the charge with
25 points, while senior Ryan Napp
added 12. Napp joined Davidson on the
all-tournament team. Schreiber, who
surely would have made the all-tourna
ment team had they picked a sixth
player, chipped in 11 points and eight
rebounds.
Following the Greyhound Classic,

tion with another road came in Allen-

Trailing 36-30 at the half, the Bullets
stormed back with an 18-6 run to grab
a six-point lead with 14:31 remaining.
The Mules answered back, how
ever, with an 18-5 run of their own and
went on to down Gettysburg 81-68.
Davidson led Gettysburg with 15

points. Schreiber and Pfeil added 14
and 13, respectively. The loss dropped
Gettysburg to 1-2 in conference play
