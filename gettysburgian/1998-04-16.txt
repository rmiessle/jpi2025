Dole speaks to packed house
Hundreds denied entrance to former presidential candidate's speech

by Rebecca Babbitt
Staff Reporter Former Senator arid GOP presi
dential candidate Robert Dole was on
campus Monday night. Dole, 1995
winner of the Eisenhower Leadership
Prize, spoke at two sessions and visited
with students at a dinner in his honor.
Dole was raised in Russell, Kan
sas and served in the Tenth Mountain
Division during World War II. He was
wounded in battle and decorated twice
for heroic achievement. Dole was a
nominee for Vice President and served
in the House of Representatives. He is
one of 16 men to serve as Senate Ma
jority Leader.
The Eisenhower Leadership Prize
is an award given by Gettysburg Col
lege and the Eisenhower World Affair
institute. The Award includes a
$25,000 prize that Dole donated to
Kansas Wesleyan University.

Dole had a question and answer
session for selected students at 5 p.m.
Many campus leaders and political sci
ence majors asked questions ranging
from the impact of the religious right
in the 1996 presidential campaign to
who might run for president in 2000.
At the evening session open to all
students and the public, Dole spoke at
length about his admiration of
Eisenhower and the need for honesty
and integrity in leadership.
Both sessions were packed with
students, press, and community mem
bers. Two hundred and fifty students
filled Mara Auditorium at the 5 o'clock
question and answer session. The
o'clock session filled the CUB ballroom

Bob Dole talked about issues of character and leadership Monday night in
the Ballroom.

dred would-be audience members.
"Eisenhower is my hero," said
Dole. "You could trust him." Dole
credited Eisenhower with being "con
cerned about the broad middle. He
wasn't worried about special interests."
Dole characterized a good leader
as someone with "integrity, honesty,
loyalty, and character." He added that
these are "endearing qualities" that
don't change.
At both sessions Dole encouraged
youth involvement in politics and skill
fully avoided criticisms of the current
administration.

"Young people ought to be in poli
tics, it is your future," Dole said. "Your
generation is going to pay the tab if
things aren't done right now."
Dole continually declined to an
swer questions about his opinion of the
Clinton presidency, saying that he was
not here to criticize. When asked about
Kenneth Starr and the independent
council, Dole said it is time to "get it
done, get it over with, and move on."
Dole proved to be very humorous.
When asked whether his wife Elizabeth
would run for president in 2000, Dole
said "it's my last chance to get to the
White House."

Dole also spoke highly of the Re
publican party. "It's a good idea party,"
he said. "We need to get our platform
out there and talk about it."
Dole ended his speech on a posi
tive note. "I really believe that we are
the greatest country in the world be
cause of our people-because we like to
get things done." Dole said the Ameri
cans are full of "generosity and com
passion." He concluded, "I think our
future is extremely bright."

Dole signs
Communist Manifesto

by Rebecca Babbitt
Staff Reporter
Most people would be
happy just to have Bob Dole's
signature, but not Paul
Hutchinson.
The senior history ma
jor was reading Karl Marx's
Communist Manifesto in the
college radio station, when he
saw Dole walk by.
Hutchinson was able to catch
the former senator and GOP
presidential candidate on his
way to dinner.
"I had come up with the
idea to have him sign the
Communist Manifesto about
an hour and a half earlier,"
said Hutchinson.
When Hutchinson

asked him to sign the book
Dole asked why Hutchinsoi
wanted him to sign Marx's bes
know work. Hutchinson, a sel
proclaimed "flaming liberal,'
told the prominent Republicai
that his signature "would pu
some value in it."
Dole chuckled and said
"It needs it."
"It was the greatest prac
tical joke I've ever pulled in mj
life," said Hutchinson, whc
wrote his version of the storj
inside the cover of the book
"I'll tuck it away somewhere
and give it to my kids someday
-it is a treasure of history," saic
Hutchinson.
"I really like the guy," saic
Hutchinson of Dole. "He is i
great American."

Students attempt to take back the night
Action group formed to combat sexual assault on campus

by Cara Masucci
Staff Reporter The statistics can be
alarming. We've all heard
them. Men and women, no
one is immune. Sexual assault
seems to become more and
more prevalent in society. With
all the horrific facts we hear, it
can seem as though there is no
light at the end of the tunnel.
One group on campus, though,
is trying to change this and
bring about the means to the
end of sexual assault at
Gettysburg College.
The group, loosely re
ferred to as the "action group"
had its start a little over three
months ago when co-directors
cf the Women's Center, Abby
Rodgers and Becky Card,
looked around and decided the
campus needed to come to
gether to curb the growing
number of incidents of sexual

assault on campus. Card
stated, "It was not a single in
cident [that started the group],
but an accumulation of events."
Card pointed out that
when she and Rodgers met at
the end of last semester, they
noticed a lack of cooperative
action on the campus in deal
ing with all forms of sexual as
sault. The two directors de
cided to set a goal for the
present semester, and make it
successful and strong enough to
carry on in the coming years.
• The group is made up of
a large congregation of women
and men from many different
aspects of college life, includ
ing students, support staff, and
faculty. The large amount of
diversity among members of
the action group allows for
many different ideas about pro
gramming and ways to, reach
the campus.

According to a student
member of the group who
joined because of her own ex
perience with sexual assault,
the campus needs to become
more aware that rape and oth¬

ers forms of sexual assault do
happen. The woman became
involved because she wanted
to educate people and prevent
it from happening to others.
The college is not immune.
The statistics hold true on this
campus, even though we can
sometimes assume we live in a
bubble.

Each week on this campus, approximately ten women are sexually assaulted.The newly formed
action group on campus is working to fight this problem. Meetings are every other Wednesday
night; call the Women's Center at x6991 for more information.

One of the main goals of
the group is to make the dis
cussion of sexual assault open
and to educate the campus on
issues of prevention and sup
port for those directly affected
by sexual assault. Another goal
is making the victims aware
that there are people out there
to help them and aid them.
To accomplish the above
goals, the group has plastered
the campus with posters, rib
bons, banners, and survival
stories. Walking across the
campus, one cannot escape
purple ribbons tied around
trees as a symbol for how many
people have been victim to
sexual assault.

There will also be a table
located in the CUB throughout
the week containing informa
tion about campus resources,
books on prevention and cop
ing, as well as a wall where
people have told their own sto
ries of crisis.
According to the action
group, the first day alone pro¬

vided a full wall of stories. Card
stated that although it is unfor
tunate to see the true number
of cases of sexual'assault on
campus, it demonstrates the
need for improvement and pre
vention of it on campus.
The group also held a
Take Back the Night rally last
night on Musselman Library
steps to raise support.
The action group is also
presently working with Cheers
to slam the campus with infor
mation. According to Alec
Beekmans, a senior member of
the action group, "We are work
ing with Cheers to combat and
build a defense against sexual
assault on this campus."

First year student
Miranna Smith likes the idea of
the involvement with Cheers
because it will be geared to
wards first year students who
can be the main targets for rape
and other forms of sexual as
sault. Beekmans's involvement
also points to a significant goal

of the group. Sometimes all
people see or think about is the
man as the aggressor and the
woman as the victim. The ac
tion group realizes this error
and, as Card puts it, "We are
not out there to ostracize men."
Men, as the group points out,
are victims too, and are affected
by rape just as women are. The
action group wants to see more
people, particularly men, in
volved in the process to elimi
nate assault.
If you think a friend has
been raped, there are signs to
look for. Thirty-one percent of
all victims suffer from Rape
Related Post Traumatic Stress
Disorder (RR-PTSD). The

symptoms of this include fear,
helplessness, shock, disbelief,
guilt, humiliation, embarrass
ment, anger, self-blame, flash
backs of the rape, avoidance of
previously pleasurable activi
ties, avoidance of the place or
circumstance in which the rape
occurred, depression, sexual
dysfunction, insomnia, and
impaired memory.
Based on U.S. Census re
ports on the number of women
in the United States, 1.3 mil
lion women currently have RR
PTSD, 3.8 million women have
previously had RR-PTSD and
roughly 211,000 women will
develop RR-PTSD each year.
Victims often pull away
from intimate relationships or,
alternatively, become regres
sively fearful, clingy, and needy.
Be sure to support your friend,
though, as when compared
with nonvictims, rape victims
have been found to be 8.7 times

more likely to attempt suicide.
If you know that a friend
has been sexually assaulted,
encourage him or her to seek
medical treatment immedi
ately. Most victims don't seek
medical care during the criti
cal 72 hours after the attack,
making gathering evidence of
the attack next to impossible.
Only 16% of rapes are
ever reported to the police.
Most believe that nothing can
be done, with other reasons
being that the victims felt it was
a private matter, they were

afraid of police response, and
others felt it was not important
enough.
If anyone is interested in
joining the action group, they
can sign up in the CUB all this
week, or call the Women's Cen
ter at x6991. The group meets
every other Wednesday night in
the Women's Center at 6:30.
The group hopes to boost in
terest in it and wants to elimi
nate the occurrence of rape and
other sexual assault from the
campus. All are welcome and
encouraged to join.

Fungi at Gettysburg

Contributing Reporter
"I seem to have been only
a boy playing on the seashore,
and diverting myself in now
and then finding a smoother
pebble or a prettier shell than
ordinary, whilst the great ocean
of truth lay all undiscovered
before me."
-Sir Isaac Newton (1642
1727) If you happen to hear a
peculiar noise echoing in the
Biology Department of
Gettysburg College, it is most
likely Dr. A. Ralph Cavaliere.
You can ask any one of his col
leagues about the dominant
trait of Dr. Cavaliere and the

answer .
"It would have to be that
noise he makes," one col
league says.
"Anyone who _^B
knows him will recog- _^^
nize the silent inhal- _^^^
ing whistle." _^^^H
Cheryl Vogel, _^^^
Laboratory _^^^^^H
Technician of _^^^^^^H
the Biology _^^^^^^
Department,. _^^^^^^^H
said that he _^^^^^^^
makes the _^^^^^^^_J
noise of- _^^^^^^^^^
ten when ^^^_f_^^^^^H
he is ^^^^^^^^^H
pleased with a ^^^^B
student's work. Ac¬

cording to her, many mutter,
"this is so great, Dr. Cavaliere
is going to hyperventilate."
Dr. Cavaliere's love for
both science and teaching shine
through this noise. You will be
able to locate good scientists in
any lab, but scientists who love
their students as much as Dr.
Cavaliere are one in a million.
When Dr. Cavaliere took
an interest in plants, he was
merely a little boy, as was New
ton when his eyes were opened
up to the atom. This childhood
interest swept him all the way
out to sea to his first research
project in Iceland. It was there
that he met up with an erupt
ing volcano that was in the pro
cess of forming an island.
Here, in 1963, he observed
marine organisms, all the while
searching for a "prettier shell
than ordinary."
Although this was very

intriguing research, Dr.
Cavaliere felt that it was time
tor a change. "I remember it
Was very cold in Iceland," said
Cavaliere. "If I ever do a
project like this again, I want it
to be in Bermuda, and lo and
behold, fifteen years later, I was
in Bermuda."
With the help of many
grants, Dr. Cavaliere went on
to an even more productive
project in Bermuda. With the
warm waters of Bermuda be
fore him, Dr. Cavaliere's career
was taken to new heights. With
its unique protected inshore
waters, including extensive
sounds, bays, and marine
ponds,the opportunities for
*—. studying marine

flora and fauna
were infinite.
According to
one of the field
guides he
authored, the
protected in
shore waters
"harbor a rich
and beautiful
variety of
marine life
_^ t hat is
quite dif
ferent from
' the off
shore
_A flora and
fauna associ
ated with the
Many of these

reefs."
organisms can be observed
merely by snorkeling or walk
ing along the shore.
Based upon his extensive
research' on the islands of Ber
muda, Dr. Cavaliere has pub
lished a multitude of books,
field guides, and articles.
Among these publications, are
The Marine Algae of Bermuda
and The Field Guide to the
Conspicuous Flora and Fauna

Be still my beating heart

by Greg Bellanca and Jen Sabo
Contributing Reporters
Learning how to measure
your heart rate at rest, during
exercise, and after exercise is
easy and practical. Your heart
rate can serve as a useful foun
dation for various exercise pro
grams.
There exist several ana
tomical sights that can be pal
pated to determine heart rate.
The carotid artery in the neck
and the radial artery (thumb
side) in the wrist are the most

resting heart rate than a seden
tary person. Aerobic exercise
performed three times a week
for twenty minutes has been
shown to benefit the resting
heart rate. There are several
other factors that affect heart
rate besides exercise, including
medications, disease, and age.
Measuring the heart rate
during exercise is a good index
of how hard the heart is work
ing and the intensity of the ex
ercise session. Achieving a cer
tain intensity level is the goal

of an exercise session. The
term target heart rate range is
used to denote heart activity
high enough to induce cardio
vascular benefits.
The target heart rate
range of typical college stu
dents is between 120 beats per
minute and 200 beats per
minute. To determine your ap
proximate target heart rate
range, complete the following
formula:
Step 1: 220 - (your age)
= maximum HR
Step 2: (max HR) x .60

common and convenient sights
for measuring heart rate.
In order to determine
your heart rate, place your in
dex and middle fingers over the
carotid or radial arteries. The
throbs you feel correspond ex
actly to the beats of the heart.
The beats can be counted for
ten seconds and then multiplied
by six.
The resting heart rate av
erage is usually between 50-90
beats per minute. A physically
fit individual will have a lower

= lowest HR for exercising
Step 3: (max HR) x .80
= highest HR for exercising
Once you are well into
your aerobic conditioning pro
gram, you will notice that your
exercise heart rate is lower than
it was during the early phases
of training. This decrease in
dicates that the heart is becom
ing more efficient through
training. In other words, your
heart is not working as hard to
accomplish a certain task.
When the exercise bout is
finished, your heart rate does
not instantly return to its rest
ing level. The time it takes for
an elevated heart rate to return
to resting levels is referred to
as the heart rate recovery pe
riod. The heart rate returns to
its resting level more quickly as
a result of endurance training.
A more physically fit person
recovers faster after exercise
than a less fit individual.

Measuring and keeping
track of the heart rate period
is an excellent parameter for
progress evaluation.

Hair Grease and poodle skirts

In Case You Missed It

by Eileen O'Donnell
Movie Columnist
In 1978, the stage play
Grease hit the big screen. Last
week it was rereleased in movie
theaters and drive-ins across
the country. The film boasts a
big name cast, starring Satur
day Night Fever heartthrob

John Travolta and
Australian pop star
Olivia Newton
John as the lovers.
Danny
(Travolta) and
Sandy (Newton
Jbhn) enjoyed a
summer romance
the summer before
their senior year of
high school. They
said good-bye at the
end of the summer

as Sandy was on her way back
to Australia. But by some twist
of fate, her family wound up
staying, and Sandy faces her
first day of school at Rydell
High. Little does she know
that Danny is also a student
there. Sandy nervously goes
through her first day and be
comes friends with Frenchy
(Didi Conn), one of the Pink
Ladies. At lunch she meets the
rest of the girls and tells them
of her summer love. Mean
while, on the bleachers at the
football field, Danny is regal
ing his fellow T-Birds with sto¬

ries of his summer fling. The
song ends with their images
against a sunset.
After meeting Sandy at a
pep rally, Danny realizes he has
to keep up appearances in front
of his friends. He can't act like
the sweet and innocent boy
Sandy knows from the summer.
His crude, macho behavior

confuses Sandy. Frenchy has an
idea: why not give Sandy a
makeover? So the Pink Ladies
have a sleepover and invite
Sandy, asking her to dye her
hair and pierce her ears. This
brings about the best song in
the whole musical. Rizzo
(Stockard Channing) breaks
out into "Look At Me, I'm
Sandra Dee," while Sandy is
out of the room.
Danny and Sandy try to
make their relationship work,
but they are so different that it
seems impossible. Then each
comes up with a plan to win
the other over for good. Both

Danny and Sandy try to change
to suit the other. The real les
son learned by the end of the
film is to be yourself; you don't
need to change for anyone.
Just about everybody has
seen Grease and can croon
along with the gang. Grease
pays tribute to the way it was,
evoking feelings of nostalgia
_^^_hm_^^_m for bobby \

ii/i ujuu y
soxers and
drive-ins. But
for we Gen
eration Xers,
who don't
know first
hand the sim
plicity of
poodle skirts
and saddle
shoes, Grease
is a window to
the world of

drive-ins and malt shops.
The supporting cast also
has some famous names:
Lorenzo Lamas (from TV's
Renegade), Jeff Conaway (who
was in the original Broadway
cast as well as being on TV's
Taxi), Stockard Channing {Moll
Flanders), Frankie Avalon, Sid
Caesar, and Eve Arden.
The best thing about
Grease is the music. The tunes
are catchy, and the lyrics are
simple and fun. This is a film
that everybody will enjoy. So
if you can't find it in a theater
near you, rent it this weekend
for a rockin' good time.

Years of laborious study were
necessary to even come close to
the "great ocean of truth" de
scribed by Newton. He re
ceived both his Bachelor of Sci
ence and Master of Science
degrees in Biology from Ari
zona State University. Dr.
Cavaliere then went on to
Duke University, where, in
1965, he received his Ph.D.

- continued from page 6 -
with a major in Botany and a
minor in Zoology. His areas of
specialization included Mycol
ogy, Marine Fungi, and Marine
Algae.
In beginning his studies,
Cavaliere was given "a great big
fungus" to start him on his re
search. Dr. Cavaliere took the
fungus home and sauteed it in
butter, garlic, and oil. The next
day, his professor asked about
what research he had come up
with. Dr. Cavaliere responded,
"I took it home and ate it." His

professor replied, "Boy, a hell
of a biologist you're going to
make." He was right. Dr.
Cavaliere has made a hell of a
biologist after all.
Following his gradutaion,
Dr. Cavaliere taught at Duke as
the Visiting Assistant Professor
of Botany. He then went on to
Gettysburg, where his teaching
was not limited to the standard
school year. He spent his sum
mers as a faculty member at the
Duke University Marine Labo
ratory and at the Bermuda Bio
logical Station for Research.

Someone once said that
"a teacher affects eternity, he
can never tell where his influ
ence stops." With his knowl
edge of both science and art,

Dr. Cavaliere has opened the
eyes of countless students.
With the help of his field
guides, now others can "play
on the seashore" as Newton
once did and Dr. Cavaliere
now does.
Years ago, Dr. Robert
Barnes, then Chairman of the
Biology Department, hired Dr.
Cavaliere to teach an under
graduate course in physiology
Dr. Cavaliere did not believe
he would be capable of teach
ing a course in a field other

than his own, but has proven
himself worthy of the job. To
day he teaches courses in Gen
eral Biology, Electron Micros
copy, and the Physiology of
Plant Adaptations.
A few of Dr. Cavaliere's
students have even gone on to
greatness. Dave Hartman was
the first blind student ever to
be admitted to an American
Medical School. Also, two of
his students, one of whom was
his advisee, received McArthur
fellowships.

Dr. Cavaliere's ability to
enlighten others, as well as his
pleasant personality, are evi
dent in the words of his col
leagues. According to Janice
Diehl, the Biology Department

secretary, "his ability to encour
age students to learn" is his best
quality. "He never forces you
to learn, but he makes it so
much fun, you just want to."
When asked about Dr.
Cavaliere, Dr. Hendrix replied,
"He is a fine person to be with
as a colleague; We enjoy work
ing with him. If you're doing
something wrong, he will tell
you, and if you're doing some
thing right, he will tell you."
Professor Hirazumai feels
the same way. "He is a fun pro
fessor to be around as a col
league, and students are lucky
to have him as a lecturer."
Perhaps the following
words of Professor Hirazumai
sum up Dr. Cavaliere the best.
"His love of and love for sci
ence is genuine, and anyone
who has known him will rec
ognize it."

When asked what his
greatest contribution to science
has been, Dr. Cavaliere re
sponded, "No one has ever
asked me that before." He feels
that his greatest contribution
has been, "to be able to take
concepts of biology and teach
them in a way that science and
nonscience students alike can
understand them."

Reel Hits & Misses
More fun than a barrel of animatronic monkeys

by Dan Larkin and Mike Petro
Movie Columnists
Dan: 1 never thought I'd
say this, but the monkey was
the worst part of the movie.
But I'm getting ahead of myself
here. Mike: My friend here is
right, the monkey was really
bad. Imagine Roger Rabbit
trying to pass as a real being
and you might get a vague idea
of what this effect is like.
Lost in Space, the cin
ematic update of the frighten
ingly campy sixties space-corn,
is a bit of a mixed bag in this
new adaptation.
All of the basic elements
of the Space Family Robinson
are left more or less intact. The
sci fi geeks out there will be glad
to see that the Robot and Dr.
Smith and Will and Penny and
Judy and Mom and Dad and
that other guy are all still there.

Lost in Space has the ben
efit of strong, if somewhat bi
zarre, casting. Dr. John
Robinson, the family patriarch,
is played by William Hurt
(Dark City, Kiss of the
SpiderWoman). Like most
characters he plays, Hurt's
Robinson is detached and aloof
until something makes him
"come around." This role is a
bit less dramatic than Hurt usu
ally plays, but he does a good
job with a pretty easy part. _r
Gary Oldman (Dracula,
The Scarlet Letter) does an ad
mirable job trying to dupli
cate Jonathan Harris' campy
Dr. Smith. The portrayal of Dr.
Smith in the movie falls short
of its mark, but this is due much
more to the script than to any
shortcomings on Oldman's
part.

Smith is made to be much
too villainous in the movie
Harris' Smith was opportunis¬

tic and cowardly, but he was
never evil.
It took me a couple of
years before I realized that Matt
LeBlanc (Ed) and Matthew
Perry on Friends were two sepa
rate people, so I guess that
LeBlanc was a pretty good
choice to play the everyman pi
lot, Don West. LeBlanc is not
much of an actor, but he doesn't
have to do too much here. He
doesn't hurt the movie.
The casting is really well
done. I like the way that you
can believe that the cast mem
bers are really a family. Hurt
and Rodgers are the believeable
parents, and the kids are midly
disfunctional, a perfect 90's
adaptation. -
Like any TV show from
the sixties, the women on the
original Lost in Space had no
personalities. Director Stephen
Hopkins attempts to remedy
this, making Mom (Mimi

Rodgers) and Judy (Heathet
Graham) into scientists instead
of just girls along for the ride.
There's some tension in the
Robinson marriage. Judy has
problems getting in touch with
her emotions. Penny feels ne
glected and unloved. But the
women still don't do anything,
leaving the all the real action
to the men and the Robot
(original voice of Dick Tufield),
just like the old series. So much
for progress.
Despite a lack of depth,
the movie is pretty fun and a
visual treat. Particularly
memorable is a scene where
Will Robinson commands the
Robot through a kind of V.R
remote control.
The effects are really well
done in this movie. I read that
this movie has more computer
special effects than any other
in history. Watch it and you'll
believe that to be true. I en¬

joyed the lush scenery and the
seamless computer animation.
This movie represents a big
step forward in special effects.
What came really close to
ruining the movie for me was
the inclusion of a cutesy com
puter-animated space monkey
as a friend for Penny. I like
monkeys as much as the next
guy (okay, maybe a little more
than the next guy), but this
thing was really annoying. This
creature fails in comparison to
the time honored legacy of sci
ence fiction monkeys (Dr.
Zaius, Gleek, etc.). But, over
all, Lost in Space is a good time.
Two and three quarter stars (out
of five).
If he likes monkeys as
much as the next guy, well
then, call me the next guy! I
liked this movie, it's a good
time and worth the price of
admission. Two and a half
stars out of five.

Library BULLETin

by Libby Musselman
Library Columnist
Q: The library is open
24 hours from Sunday-Friday,
but what does that really
mean? I mean, the building
is open, but other stuff isn't,
what's the deal?
A: The building being
open means there is access to
library materials, study space,
and the student computer lab.
It also means that one library
staff member is here to over
see the library and to check
out materials to students.
There are also a lot of services
which are not available all
night long because of staffing.

Q: Is it too late to sign up
for an RPC?
Heck, no. It only takes
about 24 hour notice. You
should sign up in the blue book
on the reference desk in the li
brary-just give them 24 hours
between the time you fill out the
request and the time you want
the appointment. A Research
Paper Consultation is that first
invaluable step in turning out a
great paper. Appointments may
be made between 10 a.m. and
noon Monday through Thurs
day, and between 2 p.m. and 4
p.m., Monday through Friday. If
none of these times are conve¬

nient for you, special appoint
ments may also be arranged.
During the consultation, the li
brarian will discuss with you
strategies for finding the most
relevant resources for your topic.
Libbv's tip of the week:
"Freshmen shall at no time wear
white trousers and shall at all
times wear only plain black socks
and black neckties." These and
other words of advice are on dis
play in the Freshman G-books in
the exhibit cases on the main
floor of the library. Stop in and
see the archive's collection of
dinks—and if you don't know
what a dink is, you'll have to
read the G-book!

Here are the hours of the
other services: Evening ref
erence help and media ser
vices are provided until 10
p.m., Sunday through Thurs
day. Special Collections closes
at 4:30 most days but is open
until 9 p.m. on Wednesday
You can drop off an interli
brary loan request anytime
but the staff leaves at 4:30.
The computer help desk
closes at 6 p.m. and the stu
dent computer hotline is
staffed until 10 p.m. You
might be surprised that we are
open 104 hours per week,
which, according to a recent
survey, is more hours than any
other liberal arts college in the
U.S.

WORDS!!! The Dole enchilada

by Christina Dickert
Columnist Did you ever notice how
words surround our lives? I
know that sounds really dense,
but I never did. It was some
thing that I totally took for
granted. But now, with ten
school days left before finals, it
seems as though those words are
everywhere. I feel as though I
am being suffocated and at
tacked by little clauses and let
ters!! HELP!!
Maybe I'm exaggerating
just the tiniest bit. I feel this way
because I have so much reading
to do. (I know I'm not the only
one, so let's relate.) And if it's
not words to read out of my
textbooks, it's words to write for
one of my numerous papers.
Doesn't it ever stop?

I am one of those people
whose mind, after reading about
50 pages in a book, my mind
starts to wander and the words
start to blur. So I raise my weary
head from the oh-so-interesting
book that I was reading to stare
blankly at the shelf above the li
brary desk that I am sitting at.
My dreams of getting to stare
blankly at nothing but wood are
dashed as I begin to read the
curious scribbling of my prede
cessors of this desk. Wow. "I
got baked at SPRING BREAK
"98." Exciting. Thanks for in
forming me. There is an apol
ogy scrawled on my right, and a

religious quote carefully written
beneath it. Fine, free expression
is just great. But no more
words!! Seriously, I don't think
that it makes any sense to
scribble when you are tired of
either reading or writing other
words.
Then, my favorite time of
night comes along. It usually
happens between midnight and
1 a.m. It begins when you start
reading- you know you are read
ing something because your eyes
are moving- but what did you
just read? I usually give up after
reading the same paragraph four
times and I can't remember any
words except "the." This means
that my brain has checked out
for the night, and, if I want to
learn anymore, I'll have to save
it for tomorrow, after I sleep.
Most of the time, I am very
happy when this special signal
:omes along, because it means
that it is time to pack up and go
to bed.

Maybe my brain is filled to
capacity. I mean, what more can
I learn? I know I am only a
freshman, but I feel so burned
out already. Most of the seniors
encounter tell me that I am
lucky. It only gets harder from
where I stand. Great. That's
really what I want to hear. But I
just want to point out one more
time that there are TEN MORE
DAYS OF CLASSES!!!! I think
[ can make it without going to
tally nuts. I hope you can too.

by Cammie Grant
Political Columnist
On Monday, Senator Bob
Dole was on campus. There
was a private question and an
swer session, followed by a din
ner and ending the evening
with a public speech. I at
tended all of the functions held
for Senator Dole. Dole was a
charismatic speaker. In his
talks he emphasized taking re
sponsibility for one's actions,
trust, honesty, and morals. He
was very careful not to attack
Clinton.
Several questions were
directed to him regarding the
Lewinsky scandal and
Clinton's progress in office.
Senator Dole responded to
these questions with humorous
remarks however, and he did
not directly criticize the
President's efforts.

Dole frequently made
references to President
Eisenhower. He labeled him
his hero. He made it clear to
the students that Eisenhower
was an outstanding president
because he kept his word and
took full responsibility for his
actions. As Dole noted, this is
very hard to come by today
Today, everyone tries to find
somebody else to blame when

something goes wrong. Presi
dent Eisenhower was a man
who stuck to his word, that is
why Dole admires him.
Eisenhower was also a very
trustworthy individual.
In his references to Presi
dent Eisenhower, Dole was
smart. Eisenhower has many
ties not only to the Gettysburg
community, but also to the col
lege. Dole spoke of a time
when he was a congressional
freshman and President
Eisenhower gave his class, both
democrats and republicans

alike, a tour of Gettysburg.
Senator Dole was also a recipi
ent of the Eisenhower Leader
ship Prize.
I heard many comments
from students that if Dole had
spoken the way he did Monday
night, he would have won the
presidential election. He was
very straight forward in his
speech, while adding jokes here
and there. He was relaxed, yet
very enthusiastic about the gov
ernment and the United States.
Dole spoke very highly about
the people of America and our
system of government.

Senator Dole is a true pa
triot and takes great pride in
our country. In my opinion, he
would have been an outstand
ing president. My first vote was

cast for Bob Dole, and I have
no regrets about it. He is a war
hero, a public servant, and an
honest man. His credentials for
the job were nothing short of
acceptable.
Currently, Dole is work
ing for a law firm. He is also
in charge of fundraising for a
World War Two Memorial in
Washington D.C. I admire Dole
because his failed bid for Presi
dent has not affected his cha
risma. He did not dwell on his
loss, but did note that the voter

turnout for the election was
very low. He spoke to students
about the importance of voting
and being involved. After all,
we are the next generation and
we must strive to continue
making positive progress in the
United States. The right to vote
is a privilege and it is something
that many U.S. citizens take for
granted. It is time for every
one, especially our generation
to become involved. Our in
volvement can prevent weak
leaders and promote a stronger
government.

Senator Dole did a phe
nomenal job speaking Monday
evening. For those of you who
were unable to attend, you not
only missed an excellent
speech, but you missed a man
speaking from his heart.

CONFLICT & Consensus
Work with positive means to gain your end

by Jay Spiese
Columnist In two weeks we will be
holding Get Acquainted Day.
All the prospective first year
students will be coming onto
campus to see if this really is
where they want to go to col
lege. This is our chance to
make one final sales pitch to
them. As a college we have
many problems that need to be
dealt with. No one can claim
that we are a perfect institution.
Last year some students felt
they had been wronged by an

administrative decision.
Get Acquainted Day last
year was hurt because members
of Phi Delta Theta hung ban
ners from their house windows
telling these high school seniors
to go elsewhere. This is not a
proper way to change the prob
lems on campus. There are
certain channels for us to at
tempt to change policy.
First, you must call atten
tion to the problem. You must
make people understand your
position clearly. Gather them
together as a base of support.
You do this through the radio
as the Communist party has
done. You can write an article

for the newspaper as I do. Use
the emails to spread the word
as was done by a rape victim
last year.
Secondly, work with the
administration, not against
them. They are not the enemy
You can oppose decisions they
make and still work with them
to find an acceptable solution.
All of us want the same thing:
a better college. We must work
together to build it.
The proposal of a fine
arts center is a great example
of this. Students and faculty
in the music and theater de
partments are working with the
administration to construct a

new performing arts building.
Through announcements at all
productions and encouraging
petitions, they have gotten
good initial success.
The third thing to keep in
mind is to always be willing to
compromise. Holding firm to
every goal, regardless of con
sequences will make you seem
valiant and romantic, but lost
causes and last stands often are.
Success comes through com
promise.
Shelby Foote one said that
as Americans, our true genius
is for compromise. It is not a
betrayal of your ideals if you
can gain some success even

when you can not win the
whole thing. Remember noth
ing happens over night. The
way must be paved with these
small successes first.
Only as last resort should
you even consider sinking
down to that kind of public dis
play. You do nothing to aid
your cause and worse still, you
reinforce your opposition's re
solve not to bargain with you.
I do not know of anything that
happened this year that would
cause another such display this
year. Still I wanted to give this
advice to anyone with a griev
ance who was planning some
thing like that.

CONFLICT & Consensus

Our reputation is our responsibility

To the. Editor:

tification (two forms) as a non- ing stupid things. Act like you

I would hereby like to
express my thoughts in re
sponse to the front page ar
ticle last week featured in The
Gettysburgian. The article
described the recent forma
tion of a group called the
Hazel Alley Association. This
association is apparently up
set with college students who
are both loud and often ob
noxious, not to mention dirty
and disrespectful individuals.
While some of the
Association's prejudices may
be unfounded, most are prob
ably at least half true. How
ever, I don't think they really
need an association to deal
with the 'problem' of college
students.
The following is ad
dressed to my fellow college
students:

Have you ever tried to
get a job in Gettysburg? If so,
and you write on the appli
cation that you are a Gettys
burg College student, the
chances are you will be
turned down on the spot od
never will be asked to give an
interview.
Have you ever tried to
rent a movie in Gettysburg?
If so, you better not tell the
clerk that you are a Gettys
burg College student. De
spite the fact that you may be
living here for several years,
you can't get it because of
your status as a student.
Have you ever tried to
walk across the town square?
If so, you better think twice.
Borough police can smell col
lege students a mile away. I
have a couple of friends who
have been harassed by more
than one officer while simply
walking across the grass on
the circle.

Have you ever tried to
get a drink at a local tavern?
If so, don't let them know
that you are a college student.
Otherwise you will have to
produce twice as much iden-

student.
So what does all this
mean? Hey! Wake up kids!
The people already don't like
us. How come, you ask. Quite
simple. Here are the explana
tions I have gotten. In the
workplace we don't show up
on weekends. At the video
store we don't return videos for
weeks at a time. At the library
they stop issuing cards to stu
dents so that they can "cut their
losses" on stolen books and
materials. On the square it is
illegal to walk, I guess (no one,
ever gave me a good explana
tion for that one). At the tav
ern, underage college kids try
to sneak in to have a beer.
They don't need an orga
nization to oppose us. The
movement is already underway.
The power to stop it lies in your
future actions from this point
forward. What will you do to
rectify the situation?

I don't think anyone in
the great town of Gettysburg
needs a lecture on discrimina
tion and prejudice. It is wrong,
or so the last 2000 years have
taught us, to stereotype people
based on their age, sex, race,
creed, or nationality—and if 1
may add, status as a student.
The fact that a college profes
sor, an educated person one
would assume, has joined this
association is absolutely abhor
rent, but people do make mis
takes from time to time.

All that aside, there is
without a doubt some grounds
to the local residents' com
plaints. The things which they
often complain about are per
tinent to a small minority of the
college population. These
same things are also true for a
percentage of the Adams
County population. As college
students and as citizens within
this community—which is
what you must view yourselves
as—we do have certain rights
and responsibilities. Quit do-

are responsible individuals,
even if you are not. Make a
game of it. Try to act like you
have some common sense and
you will get respect back from
the townspeople. Money isn't
everything, and the town can
survive without ours, so quit
spitting on them every chance
you get and things just MIGHT
get better, for all of us.
Oh yeah, I am a college
student and a resident of Get
tysburg. Which ignorant ste
reotype would you like to ap
ply to me? The lines aren't al
ways so clear. Let us stop build
ing this wall.
Respectfully submitted,
J. Christopher Meixner

Bullets narrowly upset Swarthmore, Green Terror

Baseball boys
droppin' bombs

by Chris Rippey
Staff Reporter The fact that this past Sat
urday fell upon Easter weekend
did not stop a large crowd of
fans from turning out for the
women's lacrosse game.
Swarthmore traveled to the
Bullet's home field for a battle
in what proved to " be a close
contest.
Despite being down by
four goals at one point, the
Lady Bullets answered back by
winning by a narrow margin
with a score of 12-11. This vic
tory improved the Lady Bullets'
conference record to 5-2.
Seniors Tory Lodge and
Kristin Sullivan provided su
perb transition from defense to
offense with their many inter
ceptions and turnovers allow
ing Gettyburg's offense the
feeds they needed.

Sophomore Kim
Fernandez ripped the winning
goal with 5:35 remaining

Bill Beining looks to take a big hack at an offering by an
opposina pitcher.

breaking the 11-11 tie. The
undisputed player of the game
was sophomore Amy
Stambaugh, who racked up 5
goals and 2 assists, all of which
took place in the second half.
This stellar performance not
only contributed to the Bullet's
victory over Swarthmore, but
also landed her a name in this
week's Centennial Conference
Honor Roll.
Tuesday, the women
hosted Western Maryland in
what proved to be another

close competition. Despite
goalie Michele Centrella's fine
goal keeping and Chrissy
Nordhoff's five goals, the Bul
lets fell, 13-12, to the Green
Terror.
Performing consistently
well in every game this season,
Shanley Cooke did a fine job
at keeping her woman out of
plays, but the offense did not
penetrate as well as they
needed to gain a victory. On
the loss to Western Maryland,
co-captain Kristin Sullivan

Amy Stambaugh jumps past her defenders and adds tremendous speed to the Bullet attack

commented, "We had a late
start in the beginning, but we
pulled together at the end of
the first half. Our transition to
attack ran pretty smooth after

by Ronnie Beeman
Staff Reporter The Gettysburg Bullets
have started the week off on a
good note. Tuesday the Bullets
defeated conference foe West
ern Maryland 8-5. Chris
Lunardi paced the Bullets by
going four for four on the day
Lunardi's three-run
homerun in the third extended
the Bullets' lead to 7-2. The
five run lead was enough for
winning pitcher Drew _Chiesa
(2-2), who scattered 13 hits and
struck out seven batters over
nine innings.
Other oustanding offen
sive performances were turned
in by Drew Lavenburg and
Brett Thorp who each had
three hits in the contest.

the get-go."
Today the women look to

The Bullets have showed
their power over the last week
and a half. The homerun barage
started against Dickinson on
April third. A blast by John
Woods put the final touch on a
13-8 win over the Red Devils.
The next day Darryl Clancy led
off the game with a homerun
against Haverford. Bill Beining
followed this homerun with
another in the fourth but it was
not enough to overtake the
Fords who defeated the Bullets
8-4. The Bullets showed the
flexibilty and strength of their
line-up as their ninth hitter,
Drew Lavenburg, also drilled a
ball over the fence.
In the second match up,
Bill Beining drilled two more
homeruns to lead the rout of
Haverford 10-1, while fresh-

man Drew Chiesa picked up his
first win of the season. The
homerun onslaught continued
as the Bullets traveled to Johns
Hopkins. Chris Lunardi and
Darryl Clancy each hit a
homerun in the 8-6 loss to the
Blue Jays.
In JV action, the Get
tysburg Bullets had an impres
sive showing against
Dickinson. Matt DeVecchi,
Pete Rittenhouse, and Ryan
Sweeny held the Red Devils to
two runs on five hits. Bill
Beining's RBI triple proved to
be the winning run scored by
Dan Sirpenski. Other hitting
stars were Pat Currier, Kit
Wannen, and Biagio Indindoli.
The error free defence was lead
by Tom Boob, Jim Nastasi, and
Jake Heisler.

First conference loss prepares women's tennis for F & M
Brian Cutter of the men's tennis team remains undefeated in number one singles

by Bev-Freda Jackson
Staff Reporter The Lady Bullets suffered
their first conference loss of the
season last week, falling to
Swarthmore 6-3. The compe
tition was tough, but wins were
posted at #2 singles by Tara
Schmitt, #6 singles by Kay
CoFrancesco and the #3
doubles team of Bev-Freda
Jackson and Kate Goodall.
This past weekend the
Lady Bullets traveled to
Haverford to take on the Fords.
Past matches with Haverford
have initiated quite a rivalry
between these two conference
teams. Coming off the loss to
Swarthmore, Gettysburg was
ready for a victory and defeated
Haverford 5-4.

The Haverford match
turned out to be a reunion of
sorts with Mary Joy Troxel '97
and Cythia Hoenes '97 coming
out to support their old team
mates.
The women's tennis team
is wrapping up the season with
a full schedule. On the sched
ule for this week are Western
Maryland, Franklin and
Marshall, and Ursinus. The
Bullets took on Goucher Col¬

lege this past Monday April 13. Glatfelter at #6. Singles action

There was no
prior knowl
edge as to the
level of compe
tition of this
team, but the
Bullets took
command.
Schmitt and
Yoshida at #1
doubles, Bauer
and Glatfelter
at #2 doubles
and Goodall
and Jackson at
#3 doubles
made handy
work of their
opponents,
sweeping the
doubles and the
match 8-1.

Singles
play was with
out Masako
Yoshida due to
a back injury,
and the line-up
was as follows:

the Lady Bullets and their se
nior captains Tara Schmitt and
Kate Goodall in the last home
match of their tennis careers.
The men's tennis team
had only one match last week,
but the competition was strong.
They traveled to Johns
Hopkins and were defeated
with the only win coming from
#1 singles player Brandon Cut
ter. The men's team is also
wrapping up their match sched
ule for this spring and look to
finish up the season with a
strong conference standing.
Yesterday, the team breezed
through a match with Western
Maryland and are looking for
ward to their competition at
Ursinus on Saturday.

Other Notes: The men's
team conference record stands
at 4-2 while their overall record
has climbed to 7-3. Brandon
Cutter remains unbeaten in #1
singles for Gettysburg, while
the doubles team of Cutter and
newcomer Weston Wells also
owns an unblemished record.
With good performances in
their remaining matches, the
men's tennis team could finish
up very well in the final con
ference standings.

Bullets flying high, trying to catch Terror

by Bill Davidson
Staff Reporter Splitting doubleheaders
with Ursinus and arch rival
Dickinson, the Women's soft
ball team fell one game behind
Western Maryland for the Cen
tennial Conference lead. Post
ing a record of 17-6 overall and
8-2 in conference play, the
Lady Bullets have found them
selves in the thick of a playoff
race. Angie Hoptak was bril
liant in the opener against the
Red Devils, pitching a 4-hit
shutout en route to her third
straight conference win.
Marybeth Korejko contributed
two RBI, going one-for-one
with a walk, in the 4-0 victory.
In the nightcap,
Dickinson used a four run fifth
inning, sending 10 batters to
the plate, to earn the split. Jen
White and Sara Graveline each
recorded multiple hit games in
the losing effort, while Alyson

Adams and Erin Killeen pro
vided_.stellar defense at the cor
ners. On Saturday, the women
dropped a 10-inning heart
breaker, falling 3-2 to the
Ursinus Bears. A sacrifice fly
in the top of the tenth proved
to end the pitching duel.
Hoptak was credited with the
loss, despite another strong
outing.
Hoptak pitched all 10 in
nings, striking out two, while
only allowing one earned run.
Karyn Miller and Marybeth
Korejko provided an offensive
spark in the losing effort, drill
ing three hits apiece against one
of the conferences best pitch¬

ers. The Lady Bullets re
sponded to this defeat by
pounding the Bears 8-1 in the
second game. Eight of the nine
starters recorded hits in this
balanced offensive onslaught.
Tract Bullock, Erin Killeen, and
Jen White each contributed

Erin Killeen patiently awaits a ball batted by her opponent.

two hits and two RBI.
The consistent bats of Jen
White and Karyn Miller paired
with the strong arm of Angie
Hoptak continue to lead the
team. Hoptak's last week per
formance earned her a spot on
the Centennial Conference's
Weekly Honor Roll.
Angie pushed her Cen
tennial Conference record to 3
1 after pitching 17.3 innings for
a 0.40 ERA with four walks and
four strikeouts. White is lead
ing the Centennial Conference
with a .526 batting average.
Miller is close behind in second
place, hitting .516.
The women conclude
their season with three games
next week. They travel to
Lebanon Valley on Tuesday,
before hosting the Messiah Fal
cons on Thursday. Then on
Saturday, the Lady Bullets will
make the short trip to Western
Maryland for a doubleheader,
which could decide the confer
ence championship.

Bullets shoot way to head of conference

by Henry Fawell
Assistant News Editor

While most of the school
spent this past week gearing up
for the holiday respite, the
Men's Lacrosse team used the
warm weather wisely by vent
ing a little on-field frustration
against Western Maryland
College and Washington Col
lege, two teams that ripped the
Bullets in 1997 by a combined
score of 28-14.
While the two confer
ence losses last year may have
been the most disappointing of
the season, this week's 15-9
victory over Western Mary
land, and a 7-3 triumph over
Washington, have catapulted
the Bullets to the brink of the
Centennial Conference crown,
a title they have not claimed
since the 1995 season.

As Western Maryland
rolled into Musselman Sta
dium on Wednesday, last year's
10-5 loss against the Green
Terror weighed heavy on the
minds of those Gettysburg
players who were there. "They

Jamie Bateman (11) makes his move past opposing defenders. ' by Emily

came in unranked at the time.
We didn't give them much

thought and we paid for it,"
said middie Andrew Edgerton,
"Everyone was thinking about
it on Wednesday."
After spotting WMC the
game's first goal, the Bullets'
silenced any effort on behalf of
the Green Terror to duplicate
last year's upset. It would be
another thirteen minutes before
they could find the net again,
and by that time Gettysburg
had a firm grip on the game's
tempo.
While ten different play
ers were able to score for the
Bullets, the most notable offen
sive performance came from
All-Conference defenseman
Brian Abbot who, one week af
ter scoring his first career goal,
racked up two more scores, in
cluding a fancy left-handed shot
coming out of transition.

Ross Garretson led the
Bullets' offense with three goals
and one assist, while Abbot, Lee
Hemming and Jamie Bateman
each scored twice. Mark Pol
lack, Rob Crowe, Doug Sage,
Christian Cronin, Pete
Milhman and Kevin Callahan

rounded out the scoring with
a goal each, Goalie Andrew
Barter spearheaded a solid de
fensive effort as he stopped 15
shots. Chestertown, Md.,
hometown to Washington Col
lege, has also been a source of
discomfort for the Bullets as
well. The Shoreman got a grip
on the Centennial title two
years ago by slamming the
door on Gettysburg, the '94
and '95 champs. Last year's
18-9 thumping of Gettysburg
solidified a second straight

title. On Saturday, though, the
Bullets fed off of an outstand
ing defensive effort and loos
ened, at least temporarily, the
Shoremens' two year strangle
hold on the crown. Goalie An
drew Barter, who was credited
with 16 saves by game's end,
teamed up with Brian Abbot,
Justin Domingos, and Mike
McCrain to hold Washington
College to a humbling three
goal output.
Not only was the defen
siye performance superb, but

it was nearly mistake-free, as
well. Gettysburg was only
called for the three penalties in
the entire contest, then stuffed
the Shoreman man-up team by
allowing only one shot in ex
tra-man situations.
Midfielder Lee Hemming
sparked the Bullets' offense as
he ripped the first of his two
goals past All-American Any
Taibl in the game's opening
minutes. From then on, Gettys
burg refused to slow down as
they piled up a 5-0 lead before
the Shoremen could slip in their
first goal.
Washington managed to
climb back to a 5-3 deficit at
the end of the third quarter, but
goals by Sage and Mark Pollack
in final period helped seal the
upset.

With the victory, Gettys
burg snapped Washington's 17
game conference win streak,
which dated back to the 1995
season. This week's conference
matchups against Dickinson
and Swarthmore are now more
important than ever, as Gettys
burg remains as the last unde
feated team in the conference.
