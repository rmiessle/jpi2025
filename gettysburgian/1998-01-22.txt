Trustees allot $50,000 for social events

by Daniel Larkin
News Editor
The Gettysburg College Board of
Trustees has alloted $50,000 to fund
social events for the 1998 spring semes
ter. President Haaland and Dean
Ramsey announced this at the January
19 Student Senate meeting.
The new funding was the result
of a meeting the trustees had with a
group of six students at the end of last
semester about social life on campus.
Val Katzmar, one of the six stu
dents, said that the group was "pretty
blunt," in addressing the board.

Katzmar said that the students told the
trustees that social life on campus has
been suffering over the last two years.
Katzmar said that the restrictions the
current BYOB policy places on frater
nity parties has created a lack of social
outlets on campus.
Katzmar, a member of senate's
Social Life Commitee, said the students
asked the trustees for a possible bar or
dance club on campus. According to
Katzmar, President Haaland responded
by asking what the students would do
if they were given money to fund social
events.
The group of six students
(Katzmar, Becca O'Connell, Mark

Astrom, Jen Gillete, Rodwin Lowe, and
Marcelo Ardon) were chosen to be rep
resentative of diverse aspects of
Gettysburg life, including Greeks, Non
Greeks, Student Government, and mi
nority students.
These six students now compr ise
an ADHOC committee formed for the
purpose of administering the $50,000
to student groups interested in putting
on ad-campus social functions.
According to Katzmar money will
be granted to student organizations re
questing to hold all-campus social
events. The adminstration of these
funds will be handled completely by the
student committee.

Katzmar said that only three cri
teria are necessary for receiving these
funds: the event must be an all-campus
event, it must follow the BYOB guide
lines, and the committee will need all
receipts.
Katzmar urged students to "take
advantage of this large amount of
money," noting that another popular
campus event, the Snow Ball costs
about $3000.
Student groups wishing to gain
access to these funds will be able to ap
proach the committee in the coming
weeks. Katzmar said that there are al
ready "lots of good ideas in the works.'

Student vehicles vandalized during Winter Break

by Laura Root
Staff Reporter Eight cars were found vandalized
in the Bream/Wright/Hauser and Sta
dium parking lots on January 6. In each
vehicle, windows were broken. Some
car owners also reported stolen items
to the Borough Police. This makes the
crime not only vandalism but larceny.
Gettysburg College Safety and
Security responded to the situation right
away. The vandalized vehicles were
towed to a compound for safe-keeping,
and their owners were informed of the
situation. Unfortunately, most car
owners were not were not accessible
due to participation in Gettysburg
sports activities.
Gettysburg College has agreed to
pay for the broken windows. Car own
ers with missing items are in contact
with their insurance companies to help
pay for those damages.

Safety and Security does not yet
have any indication of who might have
committed the crime. Because the van
dalism occurred over the Winter Break.
Nor do they also do not know exactly
when the crime took place.
To prevent this from happening
again, Safety and Security is increasing
their patrol of all parking lots. There
is also a possibility of cameras being in
stalled in order to monitor probelm ar
eas more effectively also exists. Sergeant
Witt, a member of the Safety and Secu
rity team, also suggested taking the fol
lowing precautions in the future:
-report all suspicious activities to
Campus Security
-store valuables in the trunk
instead of in plain view
-keep doors locked/ keeping
windows up
-park in a well-lit area

/ want my cable TV

by Ann Marie Bielli
Staff Reporter Gettysburg College students
now have 36 new sources of pro
crastination. To many a
student's delight, 36 new cable
channels are now available for
viewing throughout most of the
College campus.
Previously students had 40
channels to browse through, but
now, due to recent changes, stu
dents can choose from 70 six chan
nels. This surprising but pleasant
change is due to the fact that
Gettysburg College's cable com
pany, GS Communications, has
changed, to a broader base through
out Adams County. Conse¬

quently, students at Gettysburg art
able to receive this benefit as well,
What makes this change sc
enjoyable is the fact that these ad
ditional channels do not cosi
Gettysburg College students a
single dime. Donald Kingston,
Director of Telecommunications
Information Resources, said the
College chose to go along with the
broader channel programming be
cause they "wanted to make the
channels available for students."
Some of the new and excit
ing channels now available for the
viewing pleasure of Gettysburg
College students include Home
Team Sports, TV Food Network,
VH-1, ESPN-2, Cartoon Net
work, Comedy Central, E!, The

Tom and Joan Norris, members of the
Class of 1960, will contribute / _s%
$50,000 this year if 40% of _^A/nrrj*
Gettysburg's alumni contribute to the / 1 / _^
Annual Fund by June 30,1998. This K_^ _/ _^ALUMNI
year, the Annual Fund's goal is $2.01 CHALLENGE
million. These dollars are used to
support financial aid, faculty salaries,
equipment purchases, student organizations, and much more.
Here's how we're doing as of December 31, 1997:

Learning Channel, The History
Channel, and ESPNews.
Kingston is also working
with a contractor and GS Commu
nications to install new fiber optic
cables from East Lincoln Avenue
near Paxton Hall to Pennsylvania
Hall. These new cables will enable
Channels 4 and 5, the Gettysburg
College television channels, to be
received at Crow, Edwards House,
Carlisle House, Sigma Chi,

past, these building have not
been able to receive the College
channels, and therefore, students
living at these residences could
not view programs such as the
ever popular, Destinos and the
CNAV training shows broad
casted earlier in the year.
On February 14, GCTV
plans to begin airing their stu
dent-run programs on these

The only major problem
with the new cable changes are
that some students must repro

all 76 channels. Telecommunica
tions has said if anyone is hav
ing problems doing this, they can
call their office at x6918. Prob
lems may also be reported to the

there is also the problem of re
memorizing all the numbers that

correspond with the channels, but
for the majority of students here
on campus, the 36 new channels
now available are well worth the
hassle. John Miller, a sophomore

new channels have given us the

chance to view popular shows such

Views from the outside

by Cara Masucci
Staff Writer Starting college is an ex
perience many people say they
will never forget. First year stu
dents are constantly bom
barded with advice. Older stu
dents describe what to expect
and the activities taking place
on campus, your parents tell
you that you need to balance
your social plans with studying,
and everyone warns you to es
tablish a good relationship with
your roommate. These are
some standard topics of discus
sion that a typical freshman is
likely to engage in.
However, one issue is of
ten left out: how it feels to go
back to where you came from.

Free:
6 months

Going back home is a unique
experience for everyone, and
visiting your old high school
can seem especially odd. Many
first year students return to
their high schools for the first
time over the winter break.
Talking to students, most
everyone seems to agree that
seeing the friends they left be
hind and visiting their favorite
teachers are the main reason
they went back to their old high
school.
For Anne Corrigan, a
freshman from Lancaster, PA,
the experience, was no differ
ent. Having left some of her
closest friends behind, who
were a year younger, she was
happy to return.
People had different reac
tions to her appearance at her
former school. Sometimes she
says she was looked at strangely
as people wondered what she
was doing there, but as soon as

people got over the initial
shock, they were really excited
to see her.
One of Anne's favorite
teachers sat her down and
made her relate every aspect of
her life at college. The teacher
even called her by the nick
name she had given Anne
when she taught her in class.
With the new addition
that had just been added to the
school, Anne felt a little over
whelmed at first. "One of my
friends had to show me
around!" she exclaimed. For
tunately, though, she was able
to see everyone and everything
she had hoped to see.

For many sophomores,
juniors, and seniors, high
school is a distant, fading
memory. When speaking of
"last year," they are no longer
referring to a time before col
lege. Many students have, by
this time, grown away from
things connecting them to their
hometowns and high schools.
College friendships replace
high school buddies, distance
separates high school sweet

back to high school? Cliques,
homeroom, bells, detention,

Though some upperclassmen

schools, first year college stu-

j[jr P er '
_^^^ _~"_~"_^^^_r tinent
an expla
nation is
the fact that many students sim
ply do not want to return to
high school, even for a visit.
They served their time and are
now free.
Though these circum
stances may apply to a major
ity of college students, at least
a select few exist who actually
do return to their high schools
throughout their college ca
reers. Junior Maureen Miller
says, "I really enjoy going back
to see my old teachers, espe
cially the ones that influenced

me." She revealed that she
loves her high school and that
when she shares with teachers
how their classes have helped
her it "makes their day and
shows them their work is
worthwhile."
Miller had a positive high
school experience, both while
in school and after she gradu
ated, and this is what motivates
her to want to return. For
those students who had more
negative experiences in high
school, however, there is little
or no desire to return. Miller
noted that it was really only the
top two percent of her class
that returned to visit after their
freshman year in college.
Sophomore Heather
Brown has been back to her

Free:
2 years

high school only once since she
has been at Gettysburg. She
had told her friends from home
she would never return to high
school, but she decided to visit
a favorite teacher and a guid
ance counselor. "It was weird,"
comments Brown. "It was small
and I realized I had outgrown
it." The visit itself was a bit
uncomfortable because every
one wanted to know what she
was planning on doing with her
life, a question she was not
ready to answer at the time.
When asked why she has
not gone back since, Brown
pointed out that she "has no
reason to."

In Case You Missed It —
Tommy Boy leaves comedic Farley legacy

by Eileen O'Donnell
Contributing Writer
Tommy Boy, released in
1995, is the first of two road
movies Chris Farley made with
Saturday Night Live costar
David Spade (the other movie
is Black Sheep). Previously,
Farley played bit parts in SNL
skits-to screen movies like
Wayne's World and Coneheads.
Farley is at his finest, star
ring Tommy Callahan, a recent
college grad all set to work at
his dad's auto parts plant.
Seven years after starting col
lege, Tommy's life is on the
right track. He has an execu
tive position, his father is re
marrying, and Tommy's going

to have a brother. Holy
Schnikes! Things couldn't be
better. But then everything takes
a turn for the worse. After Big
Tom's sudden death, Tommy
has to take over his dad'b sale
route with only his dad's smug
assistant, Richard (Spade) to
guide him.
Wacky adventures ensue
as Tommy and Richard try to
sell brake pads before the bank
forecloses on Callahan Auto
and his evil stepbrother and
stepmother (Rob Lowe and Bo
Derek) take over what's left of
the family fortune.
Lowe shines as Tommy's
menacing stepbrother, Paul.
Lowe has gone from playing

the heartthrob of such Brat
Pack films as St. Elmo's Fire
andT/;e Outsiders to playing
the villain in Wayne's World
and Tommy Boy. Lowe, how
ever, is a villain subject to con
stant mockery and ridicule
from the movie's heroes.
Another face to look for
is SNL alum Dan Akroyd, who
plays a small role as an auto
parts tycoon interested in buy
ing out Callahan Auto.
Both Farley and Spade
are at their funniest in this film.
These two comedians comple
ment each other with their in
dividual styles. They are polar
opposites: Spade with his dry,
sarcastic humor, and Farley
with his lovable buffoonery and

physical comedy.
Farley and Spade offer a
fresh look at traditional com
edy teams like Abbott and
Costello and Laurel and Hardy
Both Farley and Spade make
the jump to the big screen with
ease. Like Mike Myers, Dana
Carvey, and Adam Sandier,
Farley and Spade have made
several movies with other SNL
stars like Chris Rock, Dan
Akroyd, and Will Ferrell.
Farley will be best re
membered as the bumbling but
well-meaning slob. This is a
role he reprises in Black Sheep
as Mike Donnelly, the brother
of a political candidate. Mike
does more harm than good in
his attempt to help his brother's

campaign, so Spade is sent to
keep him out of the way. The
chemistry between Spade and
Farley makes Black Sheep a hit
as well.
Farley once more plays
the lovable buffoon as "the
great white ninja" in Beverly
Hills Ninja.
Farley followed the foot
steps of his larger-than-life idol
John Belushi. Like Belushi, his
untimely death has been la
mented, for it will be a long
time coming before the world
sees a fresh comedic face like
Farley's.

Good Will Hunting Is

by Mike Petro and Dan Larkin
Op/Ed and News Editors
Before we begin, our hats
go off to the Majestic theater
for finally installing some de¬

cent seats. Glad to see where
that three dollars I paid for a
soda is going. However, this is
not the only reason to go and
see Good Will Hunting.
The story of Hunting at
first glance is quite simple. Will
Hunting, a troubled youth
from South Boston holding
down a job as a janitor at MIT
divides his time between drink
ing, fighting, and higher math¬

ematics. One thing leads to
another and his genius is soon
discovered, along with his
troubles. What follows is a
wonderfully written story
about relationships, personal
demons, and how we all must
deal with them.
The fact that this is movie
had been billed as a "wonder
fully written story about rela
tionships, personal demons, and

how we all must deal with
them," worried me at first.
But Good Will Hunting really
impressed me. I was expecting
a sappy romantic drama, but
instead found a thoughtfully
directed and intelligently
scripted film. Sure , it's tragic
and romantic. But it's done in
a realistic, non-melodramatic
way. In addition to an excellent
story, the film is set against a
very colorful background . As
a Massachusetts native, my fa
vorite part was the wonderful

Southie accents heard through
out the movie.
This really is a good
movie. Matt Damon {The
Rainmaker, School Ties, Cour
age Under Fire), the newest
Hollywood find, in the title
role, stars with an excellent
supporting cast including Ben
Affleck {ChasingAmy, Mallrats,
Phantoms) as Chuckie, Robin
Williams {Good Morning Viet
nam, Dead Poet's Society,
Awakenings) as Shawn, and
Minnie Driver {Grosse Point
Blank, Circle of Friends).

All actors turn in believ
able and powerful perfor
mances that draw the viewer in
and make them connect with
the characters. Beyond the per
formances, this is a very well
written movie with a believable
and engaging story.
The acting is really amaz
ing in this movie. It's really

good to see Robin Williams do
ing good movies again. He's a
very good actor, but in the past
couple of years he's been floun
dering in ridiculous family
drivel. fFlubber and Father's
Day spring imediately to mind.)
I don't think I 've liked him this
much in a movie since The
Fisher King. I loved Ben Affleck
in Chasing Amy, and he's even
better here. Matt Damon proves
that's he more than just a pretty
face, with an unbelievable per
formance. His character is the
perfect mix of Southie street
punk and mathematical genius.
All three o f these guys should
be, at least, considered at Os
car time. As the only female
member o f the film 's excellent
cast, Minnie Driver, more than
holds her own as Damon's ro
mantic foil.

Overall, I give this movie
a four and a half out of five
stars. Robin Williams deserves
serious consideration for an
Academy Award, acknowledg
ing his true talent as a dramatic
actor, and the screenplay, co
written by Damon and Affleck
is one of the best to hit the
screen in a long time. In short,
go see this movie.
/ don't see why anyone
wouldn't like Good Will Hunt
ing. In short, it's a wicked good
movie. I give it " fouh out of
five stahs."

Upperclass students stay away

outs. "The teachers are usually
happy to see me," he says.
"They always want to know
what I'm doing when I gradu
ate." The visiting students not
only have similar reasons for
returning, but many also find
the same situation upon their
return: change. The students
filling the ranks in high schools
now are mostly those who were
in middle school when
Gettysburg's classes of '98, '99,
and 2000 walked the halls.
Gardner noted that the
overall style of the students had
changed; "the 'preppy' look of
button-down shirts and khakis
is no longer the norm," as stu
dents wear baggier, more
ragged clothes and hairstyles.
"It looked messy compared to
this school," commented one
sophomore after a visit to her
high school.

Junior Paul Herzer re
turned to his school in Prince
George County, Maryland, to
let his old teachers know that

continued from page 5
his parents had moved to
North Carolina in order to al
low his sister the chance to re
ceive a safe education.
During this visit he dis
covered that the school had
added metal detectors, surveil
lance cameras, and increased
police security. He was also
offered drugs, asked if he had
any to sell, almost had his car
broken into, and almost got
into a fight with a rival gang
that had not forgotten him.
Due to the increasing size
of classes coming through the
middle schools of the nation,
some Gettysburg students re
turned to find their high
schools looking not smaller, but
much larger and completely
unrecognizable due to recent
additions.

One sophomore recalls
having to ask for directions
while visiting her recently en
larged high school. "We had
to deal with the ongoing con
struction, but we never got to
use the new parts of the

school," she says.
Upperclassmen do not go
back to visit their high schools
for many reasons. Some sim
ply have no desire to return to
a place that holds nothing (or
bad memories) for them, while
others do not want to face the
changes or admit to themselves
that they are growing up.
Gardner estimated that
17 people from his hometown
were attending Gettysburg
when he first arrived and does
not recall any of them return
ing to visit the high school.
"High schools don't do
anything to bring back old stu
dents. Mine was a public
school, so they weren't look
ing for money. They don't
need us after we've graduated,"
he commented.

Though high schools may
not encourage graduates to
visit, many find the relation
ships with old friends and
former teachers a strong
enough incentive to return to
their alma mater.

Freshmen return

continued from page 5

time, though, once he got over
his initial shock.
The first time students
return to high school is often a
very enjoyable experience.
People are excited to see some
one who has gotten out, and
the alum feels the pleasure of
being able to laugh at what was
left behind.
However, the more often
a person returns, the less plea
surable it is. The high schoolers
begin to scorn the alum, won
dering what kind of social life

the cool graduate actually
leads. Alums have been kicked
off campuses for being around
too much.
Some students agreed
that certain changes were not
for the better. Several students
who attended high school in
upstate New York were upset
to learn that the administration
in their high schools had taken
a disappointing step in becom
ing much more strict in rules
and regulations.
One school, better

known for high-test scores than
a drug problem, had a dog
brought in to sniff out the stu
dents' lockers for illegal sub¬

nces.
This shows the lack of
trust the administration feels
for the student body. One stu
dent commented, "I'm glad I
got out when I did!" Other
than the tightened security
measures within the school, the
student was glad to see her old
friends.
For most freshmen at
Gettysburg, the experience of
going back to their alma mater
is a positive one. Initially, see
ing friends for the first time in
over four months feels awk
ward, but as time goes on, the
students begin to feel more
comfortable as old ties are
reawakened.
The sentiment was best
expressed by Anne Corrigan,
who said, "I will never forget
the people or the experiences,
because they made me who I
am."

Circumcision, the surgi
cal removal of the foreskin of
the penis, developed into a rou
tine practice in the U.S. in the
twentieth century. The U.S. is
the only Western nation to
practice routine, non-religious
infant circumcision, where
roughly 60 percent of baby
boys are still forced to undergo
this painful surgery, done usu
ally without anesthesia and al
ways without the infant's con
sent. Worldwide, 85 percent

After reading your
John Dunlap's] November
13 column, I thought it
would be of interest to you
and your readers to learn
that the only defeat for the
Goodling dynasty was
Neiman Craley, a graduate
of Gettysburg College, class
of 1950.
While I am certainly
not a fan of Congressman
Goodling_'s, I surely do hope
he wins his expected pri
mary. His probably oppo
nent, Charlie Gerow, repre
sents and is supported by
the most right-wing wing of
your Party and his positions
on Public Education and
Choice should be carefully
examined.

I am also, as an Alum,
disappointed that the Col
lege would have him there
at this time. The prestige
of Gettysburg College in
this area and among the
many District voters will
stand him in good stead

M.D. and George C.
Denniston, M.D., in their book
Say No to Circumcision!
(Hourglass, 1996), detail forty
compelling reasons why cir
cumcision is harmful to males.
Routine circumcision
adds $240 million/year need
lessly to rising medical costs,
and it has definite risks. The
complications are numerous,

and can be tragic! Circumci
sion also causes a loss of some
sexual sensations and function.
For the uncircumcised male
and his female partner, the
foreskin enhances sexual plea

Consider this

Safety 8c Security's of
fice on the corner of Washing
on and Stevens Streets acts as
)ur own Legion of Justice, but
:hey are much maligned in our
:ommunity.
As one yells for help,
superman is expected to arrive
n a timely fashion. What
)eople don't realize is that
_Juperman also has to go and
escue countless other students
ill over campus—from fire
darms and lockouts to escort
ng the wary home.
Complaints range from
legligence to sluggishness to
gnorance.
The recent vandalism
_ind larceny to cars over Win
:er Break has brought an ad
litional onslaught of criticism
:o Safety & Security.

Safety & Security does a
fine job in dealing with situa
ions such as lockouts and re
sponding to fire alarms, but
ieems to have a harder time ef
fectively responding to more
serious crimes. They are not a
jolice force, nor do we wish
:hem to be; however, it seems
idd that they did not notice
so many vehicles which were
iamaged in such an obvious
;tate. Is the persecution war
ranted, or is the alleged negli
gence the effect of the aug¬

mented responsibilities from an
increased student population
and extended campus grounds?
But over Winter Break,
there were no students.
Superman never made ce
lebrity guest appearances. Yet
Safety & Security is often called
into situations where they aren't
needed. This overuse of these
services is partly to blame on
overly anxious students whose
problems could be solved by an
other agency.
Furthermore, Safety &
Security's usefulness is question
able in some scenarios in which
anything they could do would be
futile. An example of such a situ
ation would be sexual assault.
This type of a situation il
lustrates the limits of the system
as it stands, since the officers
don't have a "legal leg to stand
on." They do have disciplinary
measures at their disposal, but
these actions are rarely taken.

We are not attempting to
bash Safety & Security. They
provide an invaluable service to
our campus community, and on
many occasions respond quickly
and effectively. They cannot be
everywhere at once.
Safety & Security are not
the police; nor are they members
of the Super Friends. And even
without super powers, they serve
the College community well.

Conflict and Consensus
The Pachyderm's Pulpit True diversity

by John Dunlap
Staff'Witer For at least the moment
it appears as if the President of
the United States will have to
put down his golf clubs, stop
talking about his legacy, and in
stead, deal with a crisis brew
ing in his Administration. A
crisis dealing not only with al
legations of an extra-marital
affair, but allegations concern
ing the possibility that Presi
dent Clinton, along with his
longtime friend, the Chairman
of his 1992-93 Presidential
Transition Team, Vernon Jor
dan, may have influenced and
urged the 23 year old woman
involved in the affair, former
White House Intern Monica
Lewinsky, to lie under oath to
lawyers for Paula Jones the
woman suing the President for
sexual harassment.

Bill Clinton is said to be
outraged, but the source of this
allegation, Monica Lewinsky,
was tape-recorded by one of
her friends, former White
House Staffer Linda Tripp. On
the tape, Lewinsky speaks
about her year and a half rela
tionship with President
Clinton, and how along with
the President, Mr. Jordan urged
her to lie. According to these
same tapes Vernon Jordan was
arranging a new job for Miss
Lewinsky in New York. Linda
Tripp's allegations go even fur
ther, as she informed
Newsweek magazine that Presi
dent Clinton made sexual ad
vances towards another White
House Staffer, Kathleen Willey
in the Oval Office. All of these
combined help the case of Paula

Jones who alleges that then
Governor Clinton sexually ha
rassed her in 1991. The Su
preme Court has ordered Ms.
Jones's case against the Presi
dent to go forward.
The White House is de
nying the charges, and Miss
Lewinsky is standing behind
her affidavit denying the
charges but her lawyer, William
Ginsburg has blasted the Presi
dent if the charges are possibly
true. Whitewater Special Pros
ecutor Kenneth Starr has been
given approval by both the Jus
tice Department and the courts
to look into the matter of the
President urging a cover-up.
Once again I am sure that
the liberals in the press and on
this campus are going to try to

attack the Special Prosecutor
and try to attack those doing
the investigation like they al
ways do to escape blame. This
time there are tapes, and for
once we can perhaps see what
Bill Clinton is really like and
how his White House is run.
Congress should now step in
and take a look at these tapes
and determine what abuse has
really occurred. To those who
attack Kenneth Starr, who was
able to get a conviction against
Bill Clinton's hand-picked suc
cessor as Governor of Arkan
sas, Jim Guy Tucker, could you
please open your eyes and see
that after this many scandals,
indictments, and convictions,
that our President has a prob
lem telling the truth to the
American people.

Now, more than legal
troubles, President Clinton
faces questions of trust and of

leadership. Just a few weeks
ago, we saw the President danc
ing on the beach with his wife,
our First Lady, Hillary Rodham
Clinton. Now we hear stories
of the President committing
adultery while he is President,
with someone just a few years
older than his daughter, and
possibly in the White House.
Bill Clinton would not be the
first President to have commit
ted adultery in the White
House but with the reporting
of it, he should have known
better. Almost six years ago on
60 Minutes , he admitted that
he and his wife had problems
but said they were in the past.
Miss Lewinsky did not start
working for the White House
until December of 1995. If this

is true, then once again Bill
Clinton has broken faith with
people he was elected to serve.
I am not the most moral
of people, anyone who knows
me will tell you that. In fact,
we all make mistakes but Will
iam Jefferson Clinton is the
President of the United States
and today that office is in dis
grace. After Watergate,
Presidents Ford, Carter, and
Reagan were able to give honor
back to the office, but that is
being destroyed. The moral
leadership of the President is
gone, and no longer can small
children look up to the Com
mander-in-Chief. The investi
gation should continue and if
the President broke the law
than perhaps we have had one
scandal too many.

by Jay Spiese
Staff Writer In the spirit of Martin
Luther King Jr. Day, I shall milk
a new sacred cow on campus:
diversity. We have all heard
people whine about the lack of
diversity. Sometimes we are the
guilty party.
Let's be honest with our
selves and others. When we say
"diversity," we really mean race.
There aren't enough blacks
here. There aren't enough
Asians here. Why don't we

have more Jews? Is there a way
we can recruit more Hispanics?
If this is what we believe makes
a place diverse, then we are far
too centered on images.
Diversity is not a matter
of how we look. If we had ev
ery race equally represented on
this campus, the diversity
would not change. True diver
sity comes from the mind. It is
our thoughts and our beliefs
that make us unique. Diversity
on campus is achievable if we
allow these thoughts and beliefs
to be freely expressed.

So then, how does our
campus stand on diversity? We
have vocal groups like ALLIES
who freely express their opin
ions. (Amazingly they do so
with little open mainstream re
sistance as evidenced by the
universal free zone that is Get
tysburg campus. If you aren't
sure what I mean then try to
find a building or office that
does not have one of those tri
angles). We have a number of
groups who should be contro¬

versial but aren't. GECO
spends five hundred dollars to
bring a speaker up from Wash
ington, but has done nothing to
clean up the Tiber area. Our
resident communists (all three
of them) were praised for their
determination to show diver
sity. I've often wondered if the
same license would be given to
a Neo-Fascist party. Were I
pessimistic in nature I would
ascribe it to a sense of apathy,
the "to- hell-with-the-world
I'd-rather-get-drunk" attitude.
Since I started writing

these articles, I have received
far more support than disagree
ment. But most of this is done
privately in whispered tones.
These individuals often don't
want to stand up and say that a
popular movement is wrong.
Many people feel the college
community does not want
them to disagree with politi
cally correct, feel good groups
like ALLIES. And so they act
in secret against the group.
Murmured discontent, tearing
down the triangle stickers, and
slurs I will not mention here.

If we want true diversity
on this campus then we must
be prepared for what that
means. We will have people
speaking from all points of the
spectrum. If someone says that
blacks should be sent back to
Africa then we can (and indeed
should) disagree, but we must
allow him to express his view
with the same freedom guaran
teed to us all.

What a tangled
WEBBER we weave

by Stephen Jenkins
Sports Editor

Here is a big surprise.
"NBA player arrested for vio
lations stemmining from a rou
tine traffic stop." Wow. You
don't say.
Yes, once again another
National Basketball Association
star, Chris Webber, goes down
the tubes after being charged
with assault, resisting arrest,
possesion of marijuana, driving
while under the influence of
marijuana and five other traf
fic related violations.
Multiple players have
been arrested in the past year
including Philadelphia Seventy
Sixers guard Allen Iverson,
most for some drug realted of
fense. Reportedly, police had to
exceed the forty mile per hour
speed limit to keep up with
Webber's car. When he was
checked, Webber could not
provide license, registration
nor proof of ownership of his
vehicle.

Apparently, Webber was
slow to answer the policeman's
questions and when the officer
reached to open Webber's door
to remove him from the car,
Webber batted his hand away
and proceeded to assualt the
man. Once he was tamed by
pepper spray, Webber was de
tained, and legally charged.
So, once again, the al
ready unexciting NBA has been
dealt a low blow by one of it's
tremendously overpaid em
ployees. Is it because the play
ers are young and immature?
Do they leave college or high
school early just for the multi
million dollar contracts teams
wave in front of them?
Of course. In case you
did not know, Webber is only a
few years our senior, and he
makes more in one year what
most of our parents will ever
see in a lifetime. He is already
making decisions that men of
his age normally would not be
making for some time.

The NBA has nothing in
their drug policy that forbids
the use of marijuana. Hello,
marijuana is illegal. If it is
against the law in the United
States of America, it should
also be illegal in the NBA.
Wait, that would be infringing
upon the rights of the players
to freely express themselves
with a joint. Yeah, good one.
Frankly the NBA, has to
reform its drug policies and
crack down on the more, irre
sponsible actions of the imma
ture players of the National
Basketball Assiociation. I can
see it now, "Hey, Chris Webber
can do it why shouldn't I?"
Well, to say the least
Chris Webber has not made a
decision this bad since he lost
the NCAA title for Michigan,
when by calling a time out that
the team did not have.

Chris Webber was a
young star of the NBA, who
had everything going his way
Why mess it up? Stupidity,
pure and simple.

Casares, Carroll, Lavigne_, Peters and

From Gettysburg Press
Release Through the Gettysburg
men's swimming team's first
four competitions of the 1997
98 campaign, 10 different
swimmers have turned in first
place performances in indi
vidual events.
Senior Pete Casares, was
a double winner in
Gettysburg's convincing 162
25 victory over Ursinus on
January 17, a meet which saw
the Bullets' record improve to

2-0. Casares won the 100yd
freestyle in 49.95 seconds and
the 1000yd freestyle in
10:44.89, and also anchored
the winning 400yd free relay.
Casares was also a part of
200yd free relay at the Frank
lin & Marshall Invitational that
established a new school
record. Casares, along with
first year swimmer David
Lavigne, and junior Rich
Carroll, and senior Todd Peters,
completed the race in 1:25.55,

Men's Swimming

Team Records

knocking almost a full second
off of the old school record
which stood for almost five
years. Junior Gavin Quinn also
accounted for a pair of wins in
the Ursinus meet. He placed
first in the 200yd individual
medley and 200yd breast
(stroke).
The Bullets took first
place in seven of the nine indi
vidual events in their other dual
meet, with a 147-53 triumph
over Washington, but had no
double winners.
In addition to their two
dual meets, the Bullets placed
second out of six teams in the
opening Centennial Confer
ence Relays and second in a
field of 11 teams at the F&M
Invitational. Gettysburg's next
home meet will be a dual meet

Men's hoops squad dribbling all over competition

By Paul Redfern
Staff Writer The Gettysburg College
Men's Basketball team beat
conference rival Dickinson 74
72 on Saturday to improve
their overall record to 7-7 and
their Centennial Conference
record to 2-2. After starting
out fast with a 5-0 record the
Bullets hit a skid, losing three
to Muhlenberg, Goucher, and
Navy before leaving for Christ
mas break.
After break the Bullets
opened at home with a tough
84-83 overtime loss to

Elizebethtown. After an im
pressive victory over Mary
Washigton the Bullets dropped
three more to Catholic, Alfred,
and Johns Hopkins.
Dickinson came into
the game unbeaten in the Cen
tennial Conference posting a 3
0 record. They won the Con
ference Championship last year
to earn a berth in the Division
III National Championship
Tournament. The Bullets after
suffering their worse loss of the
season to Johns Hopkins came
into the game very much in
need of a win.

Sophomore forward Rich
Pfeil led the Bullets scoring
while Junior center Matt
Rothenburger led the rebound
ing efforts with a game high of
12. Gettysburg got going early
with offensive scoring behind
their Co-Captain Senior for
ward Terry Schofield.
Dickinson was able to- stay in
the game with 16 first half
points from their Senior center
Nate Brought.
Brought was a force as
both a scorer and a rebounder
in the first half. With Sopho
more forward Bill Davidson out
with an ankle sprain Freshman
Mike Monroe stepped up for
the Bullets and provided some
depth off the bench. Gettys
burg went into the locker room
down 11, 44-33.

In the second half the
bullets came to play. With a mix
of both man and zone defenses
the Bullets were able to take
control of the tempo of the
game. Junior Kevin Carrol hit
some big 3 point field goals
down the stretch for the Bullets.

Rothenburger and Bowman

fense to control Brought inside
and held him to 10 second half
points. The bullets defense
held Dickinson to just 27%
shooting in the second part.
With 4:15 seconds left in the
game Matt Rothenburger hit
an open layup to go up 74-66.
Dickinson fought back

and went down two when
Steve DeArment hit 2 foul
shots. With :00 seconds left
Brought was fouled by Pfeil
and missed the first of two foul
shots to seal the victory, 74-72.

Bullet point-woman Jen Dravis must be a bus driver because she takes the competition to
school. Jen and the rest of the much improved Bullets team is off to a 9-3 start.
