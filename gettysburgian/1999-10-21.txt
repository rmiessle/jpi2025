College Navigation gets
a major face-lift

By Kristine Meier
Staff Writer
CNAV, the online program staff
and students at Gettysburg College
have come to know and love, was the
brain child of Mr. Mike Martys, who
created it a few years ago to accom
modate the
College's
online
needs.

"Stu
dent's
wanted things that
a general
web page
couldn't
serve and
we realized
that the
only way to
help them
was to cre
ate an indi
vidual pro
gram," said
Martys.

CNAV
currently
has many
positive ap
plications
that helps
both staff
and stu
dents, but
the college is
looking to
add many

Gettysburg College's Computer Science department is working
diligently to create a more user-friendly and beneficial C-NAV system
for students and facutly members alike.

more. The college strives to improve
CNAV by transforming it from a sup
port tool to an instrument to be used
with more labs and other academic
projects.
"We are adding many new dimen
sions to CNAV and are looking to move
it beyond what it currently is," said Dr.
Rod Tosten, Chair of the Computer Sci
ence department.

One aspect of CNAV, the Interest
tool, has several applications including
one which helps students see what ac
tivities are going on around campus that
might be of interest to them and logging
interests so students can find others that
have common interests.
But how many students are actu
ally using the Interest tool? This was a

question in the minds of Martys and
Tosten that received a discouraging re
sponse. As a result, a group in Dr.
Tosten's CS 335-340 software engineer
ing class is taking on the task of making
it more user-friendly.
The class, which is for senior CS
majors, is broken up into four groups to
work on major group projects for the
duration of a whole academic year. The

goal of the class is to give students an
idea on what a real-life working situa
tion would be in the field of computer
science.
Paul Koether, BJ Jones and Brian
West are the students responsible for the
Interest tool improvements. The name
of their "company", Wild West Soft
ware Inc., recently posted a survey re
garding the Interest tool on
CNAV. They are anticipat
ing campus feedback from
the survey to help them de¬

cide what improvements
they will make.
One of the main goals
is to have students take ad
vantage of the Interest Wiz
ard, which lists, via sun
glasses, the activities it is
told that each student
shows interest in. The
more sunglasses that are
posted next to an event or
activity, the more interest
the Interest Wizard knows
you have. It does this by
way of the classes, clubs,
major(s)/minor(s) a student
has logged in.
The other groups in
Dr. Tosten's class are work
ing on such items as a Res
ervation tool, to reserve
rooms in The Dining Cen
ter, Library and other
places on campus, a univer
sal departmental template,
and the Portfolios in which
a select group of First-Year
students will be involved.
"It's a welcome invi¬

tation for the whole campus and other
departments to brainstorm ideas for the
improvement of CNAV," said Tosten.
"Our main goal is to help students
have a better time with their education
and socially here at Gettysburg. CNAV
is the student's tool and we will do
whatever the students want," added
Martys.

Fraternities across the
country help keep drunk
drivers off the road

by Jennifer wig
Daily Egyptian
Brad Honey stumbled as
he stepped into Joe Bernat's car
at 2 a.m. Sunday, avoiding pos
sible death or injury, by refus
ing to drive home drunk.
Bernat, the sober driver
on call for the night, and
Honey are members of the
Southern Illinois University's
chapter of the Alpha Tau
Omega fraternity, which has
established a program called

Brothers Against Drunk Driv
ing. The program, which
started Sept. 24, will continue
for the remainder of the school
year. BADD consists of three
ATO members who are del
egated to be on call for any fra
ternity brother who needs
transportation after a night of
drinking alcohol. The on-duty
members act as chauffeurs Fri
day and Saturday night from 10
p.m. to 3 a.m.

For Patrick Reilly, a jun
ior in information systems tech
nology and an ATO member,
drunk driving is a personal is¬

sue. "It was the first time my
uncle beat my grandfather, [in
a game of golf] so they went to
the clubhouse and had a couple
of drinks," Reilly said.
"It was more than my
uncle could handle. They took
two different cars. My uncle
took a turn too quickly and hit
a tree and died."
The fraternity also offers
assistance to a different soror
ity each weekend. The week
end of Sept. 24 and 25, the
Sigma Kappa sorority partici
pated in the program.
Kristina Baker, vice presi
dent of Sigma Kappa, said
BADD allowed a carefree night
for her sorority sisters.
"It gives all the girls a
chance to go out without wor
rying about designated driv
ers," said Baker.

Don Elliott, community
resource officer of the
Carbondale Police Depart
ment, said most people in
Carbondale have acted respon
sibly in regard to drunk driv
ing. "Our arrests for DUIs are
down this year from previous

years," said Elliott. "As of Au
gust, we've only had seven
DUI-related accidents."
Tom Webb, ATO public
relations officer, said that be
cause drunk driving is one of
many problems for college stu
dents, they want to set a good
example.
"We want everyone, not
just our brothers, to drive
safely," said Webb. "Eventually,
we'd like to make it a campus
wide program."
Webb also said the frater
nity is asking phone companies
to donate cellular phones to
increase efficiency, but it has
received no responses.
Until the fraternity re
ceives a reply, its members will
continue to wait by the living
room telephone, keeping their
brothers and sisters out of
harm. ATO member Ryan Dou
glas is enthusiastic about the
program.

"I think it's a good idea,"
said Douglas, a junior in man
agement information systems.
"I didn't think it would work
but it does."

Real World scores huge ratings as
student deals with alcohol abuse

byTMS Campus
NEW YORK (TMS) — A
young woman's problems with
alcohol abuse have given
MTV's "Real World" record
high ratings.
Ruthie Alcaide, a journal
ism student at Rutgers Univer
sity, returned to the cast of the
nonfiction show last week af
ter spending one month in an
alcohol-treatment program.
The show — a weekly
series about what happens
among seven young strangers
living together for four months

— has faithfully documented
Alcaide's downward spiral. In
one episode, viewers watched
the 21-yearold fall down drunk
in a club and throw up half
naked in a shower. After she
passed out in her bathroom, the
show ended with emergency
workers pumping her stomach
m an ambulance.
Since the season began in
June, "Real World" has seen a
41 percent jump in the num
ber of households tuning in
each week. The show, which
debuted in 1992, is now MTV's
highest-rated series and has

helped lift the network's over
all ratings, up 18 percent so tar
this year over last, to an all-time
high. Alcaide's problems have
been a significant part of this
season's "Real World" and its
promotions — something that
MTV executives say has been
instrumental in showing the
dark side of alcohol consump
tion. "If you saw what was
happening to Ruthie, it would
be very hard to think that al
coholism or excessive drinking
is glorious," Brian Graden, the
network's top programming

executive told The Wai! Street
Journal.
The network also has de
fended its decisions not to in
tervene or shirk from covering
Alcaide's substance abuse.
"We're documentanans
who want to document young
people's lives," said "Real
World" co-producer John
Murray. "If we, as older, per
haps wiser adults, step into ev
ery situation and try to solve it
for them, we're not going to
wind up with a program that
deals with these problems."
Some cast members won
der if Alcaide's return is wise.

Colin Mortensen, a 19-year
old currently on the show, told
The Wall Street Journal that the
"Real World" is the wrong
place for someone with a drink
ing problem.
The show "is conducive
to heavier drinking" and "isn't
a good environment for some
one to recover in or be safe" if
they are struggling with addic
tion, he said. Put a group of
young people together and
"what are they going to do?"
he asked. "They party."
Alcaide has refused inter
views to discuss the matter.

Alpha Xi Delta closes
its Gettysburg Chapter

The decision was not
based on any type of scandal
and was not forced upon the
girls in any way, explained se
nior sister and chapter presi
dent Miranda Fegley at a recent
Panhel meeting. The active sis
ters made a joint resolution to
close the chapter, leaving the
option of re-colonization sev
eral years from now open.
"We're all sad," com
mented a sophomore sister,
"but it was the best option for
us right now. Besides, we're
still sisters and we always will
be."

past few years, however,
strongly influenced the recent
decision to close.

Student teachers combine college with
Real World

by Barb Dickson
. Editor-in-Chief
Some students have taken the no
tion of an internship up a notch. Each
semester a group of education minors
leaves the campus of Gettysburg Col
lege and enters the world of small desks,
small people, and being called by their

last names. These people are
the student teachers.
Student teachers spend a
semester living here at
Gettysburg College while teach
ing at an area school. They
spend their days getting up
early, teaching a bunch of chil
dren, grading papers and mak¬

ing lesson plans. Then, as the
rest of the campus community
is just getting into full swing,
they go . Thoug
teachers live on campus, they
lead entirely different lives.
"The early hours get to
you," says senior Jaime Tall,
who is teaching seventh grade
English at Gettysburg Middle
School. Other student teachers
also commented on the differ
ent hours they have to work.
"Our hours are so skewed
that it's hard to find time to do
the work," comments senior
Damien Thaxter, a U.S. and
European history teacher at
Gettysburg Area High School.
"It's definitely different,"
notes senior Sara Abbot, a
fourth grade teacher at Lincoln
Elementary. "It's a regular

educating the youth of Gettysburg (pictured here).

schedule so you have work every night.
I have to be up before seven and don't
get home until around 5."
Their opinions on the workload
vary. Brent LaRosa, also a U.S. history
teacher at Gettysburg Area High School,
comments, "Student teaching is the
most work I ever had. College courses
on top of a 40 hour plus work week."
Tall concurs. "I would say [the
workload] is a lot more. It depends on
how much you put into it yourself. It's
more work than a normal semester."
Thaxter says, "[The workload]
isn't too bad. . . It all depends on the
amount you're willing to take in the
classroom."
The education program has grown

in the past ten years. In 1989 there were
nine student teachers; right now there
are over 200 students who are in the
education program.
The program has also grown in
reputation, and all the student teachers
praised Gettysburg's Education Depart
ment. When asked if she felt prepared,
Abbot said, "Definitely. We have to ob
serve a lot of hours [at schools] before

we can start student teaching, so I had
a pretty realistic idea of what I'd be
encountering and what I'd have to do.
I think Gettysburg has a great educa
tion program. We have to take a lot of
classes before we can teach."
By student teaching, these college
students are getting an idea of what life
as a teacher will be like. La Rosa com
ments, "I think it is a good picture of
what a first year teacher's life is like.
Once you settle into teaching there are
some things that come naturally, things
that you have to work at as a first year
teacher."
Tall is finding out another aspect
of student teaching. He says, "I think
one of the best parts [of student teach¬

ing] is that it gets you into the commu
nity. I feel like I'm part of the
Gettysburg community now. I'll be
walking around town and I'll see my
kids. I think a big part of being a teacher
is being part of the community."
Thaxter noted, "There's a lot of
stuff that we don't have to do now that
we're going to have to do later. It [stu
dent teaching] does as much as it can."

In addition to spending their days
at school, student teachers also have to
handle taking courses here at the Col
lege. As they deal with student teach
ing, they have to deal with Education
Purposes, Methods, and Media, Tech
niques of Teaching and Curriculum of
Secondary/Elementary Level, and the
student teaching seminar.
The work for class, in addition to
the work for school, can be a bit over
whelming. According to Thaxter, the
worst thing about student teaching is
the amount of extra work he has to deal
with. Other student teachers had differ
ent ideas about the worst part of stu
dent teaching. LaRosa's least favorite

thing about teaching off-campus is "be
ing almost completely removed from
the college social community, something
that has been a part of me for three
years. Now I watch others doing things
that I cannot do because of my full time
schedule."
Abbot's least favorite aspect of
teaching involves her children. "Find
ing out the horrible things that actually
go on in people's home lives [is
|_h the worst part]," she commented.
H "Having to try to teach children
H who come from a horrible home
H life setting is really difficult."
H Judy Brough, Chair of the
_^m Education Department, says,
_^M " Many [student teachers] are
H shocked by the difficult lives their
_^ _B students lead outside of school."
_^1 The process of becoming a
H student teacher is "rigorous," ac-

cording to Brough. Students must
_^m meet minimum grade point aver
H ages both overall and in the ma
H jor. Students complete applica
^M tions a year before when they
H want to teach. Their major de
|H partments meet and decide whom
xx" x to recommend for student teach
||k| ing. The application itself in
B| eludes a writing sample and two
|p letters of recommendation. The
ji Teacher Education Committee,
H which includes various depart
H mental representatives, then re
views all applications and dis
cusses the individuals. At this
point the applicant is either un
conditionally accepted, condition
ally accepted (in which case a con
tract is drawn up), deferred (in
which case the committee will review
the application after another semester),
or rejected.

The students then are set up with
a school and cooperating teacher. Stu
dents may request a certain school,
grade level, and/or cooperating teach
ers. Otherwise, Director of Field Ex
periences Ron Miller looks at the ap
plication for specific information and
approaches a school district represen
tative for placement. Cooperating
teachers must meet state-mandated cri
teria and are recommended by their
principals. Students must also pass with

Fighting the germs

by Kristi Allen
Contributing Writer

It's that time of year
again, when just about every
one you know has the sniffles.
With the sudden change of
weather, this year's cold and flu
season has been ushered in.
How do you keep from catch
ing what everyone else has?
Short of becoming a recluse or
wearing a contamination suit,
there are a few simple things
you can do to keep from get
ting sick.
Wash your hands. The
common cold is not spread pri
marily through coughing, as is
generally believed. The num
ber one way infections are
spread is by hand-to-hand con
tact. Most people-cover their
mouths when they cough but,
if they do not wash their hands
before touching a surface, they
can spread the " bug". The
common cold virus can survive
up to three hours outside a host
on an inanimate object.

If it is not convenient to
wash your hands, keep touch
ing your face to a minimum;
that way if you have picked up
any germs they stay away from
your mouth and nose. The
mouth, nose, and eyes are the
most common entrance points
for infections Get your rest. Power
naps do help if you cannot
seem to get in enough hours
each night. Your need a steady
regime of sleep to keep your
body running smoothly. Not
only does sleep keep you alert
in classes and improves your
mental capacity, but it also al¬

lows your body to recharge.
Eat right. This seems
impossible when you are on the
go, but getting the right balance
of nutrients gives your body the
fuel it needs to fight off any
stray "bugs" you may have
picked up.
If you try your best but
still catch a cold, the best thing
you can do is visit the Health
Center. Even if you just have a
mild cough and the sniffles, you
should get help. Many more
serious infections, like the flu,
have beginning symptoms simi
lar to the common cold. Early
identification and treatment
can halt the process before it
gets worse.
If it is found that you
have a bacterial infection, you
may be given an antibiotic.

TAKE THE ENTIRE PRE
SCRIPTION, even if you begin
to feel better before you are fin
ished with the medication. As
you may have been hearing in
the news, resistance to antibi
otics is growing. Some of the
bacteria you are harboring may
have a mild resistance and if
you do not take the full amount
of antibiotic, these bacteria will
survive. Not only can you get
sick again but, the bacteria can
pass its resistance on its friends
and family! Now we have a
whole clan of resistance bacte
ria. Even if you do not seek
help, try not to spread the ill
ness. Wash your hands, avoid
prolonged contact with people,
drink plenty of liquids, and get
extra sleep. You'll feel better
and keep everyone around you
healthy.

certain score qualifiers on sev
eral state-mandated national
standardized examinations.
A good way for people
interested in education is to get
involved in the Education
Club. Tall is the president of
the club, which brings in speak
ers and goes on field trips to
learn about teaching as an oc
cupation. On November 3,

there will be a student teacher
pizza chat at 4 p.m. in
Weidensall 108 where inter
ested students can talk to cur
rent student teachers. At the
end of the semester, the student
teachers will present their port
folios. Brough invites all to
attend.
In general, the student
teachers are enjoying their se
mester. "I'm having a great
time teaching," says Thaxter.
"I love the kids...even the an
noying ones."
Abbot says "getting to
work one-on-one with the kids,
getting to know the students,
and seeing their develop
ments," as being the best parts
of student teaching.
"It's very rewarding,"
says Tall. "You get a lot support
from the education department
itnd from your cooperating
teacher. It's a lot of fun-I'm
hanging out with kids all day.
I can't complain."

Brough comments, "Stu
dent teachers report that they
learn a great deal about them
selves through this experience.
Most report that they had no
idea how difficult, tiring, and
challenging it would be.. . Suc
cessful student teachers tell us
how much pleasure they get
fi om helping someone to learn
and how good _^t makes them
feel to be positive role models
in their students' lives.

"But perhaps most im
portantly, they learn that teach
ing is about someone other
than themselves. They commit
themselves to an incredible task
only to give credit for success
to their students. Their own
successes depend on the suc
cesses of others."
Overall, these students
work very hard, but find their
jobs rewarding. "I know that I
am doing something worth
while," says LaRosa. "It is the
first time that courses I have
taken in college actually feel
like they have practical uses
outside the classroom. The
theory and the preparation are
given to you; now it is time to
use the tools you have gotten
from years of study."

Study Room

Musselman Library is nearly 20
years old, and while young - as
buildings go on campus -
twenty years is old for a library
"There are many things we
need to do to modernize the
library," she said, citing the
plans to install more data jacks
throughout the library to allow
for portable computers. "We
hope to replace the existing
furniture with wired study car
rels, add more group study
spaces, update the microfilm

- continued from page 7 -
and media areas and open up
Special Collections for student
use." The newstudy room on
the third floor is a first step in
this direction.
Room 302 is named in
honor of Reverend John Wil
son Harner, Class of 1937, and
is a gift from his wife,
Catherine N. Harner of
Littlestown_, Pennsylvania and
their son Royal Harner, of
Capitola-by-the-Sea, Califor
nia. After graduating from

Gettysburg College John
Harner attended the Lutheran
Theological Seminary at
Gettysburg, graduating in
1940. He was ordained in
1941. The Reverend Harner
served the Evangelical
Lutheran Church of America
for more than forty years. He
held the title of Pastor Emeri
tus at the Giace Lutheran
Church in Reading until the
time of his death in 1998.

The sun still shines

by Lisa Smith
Class of '99
I woke up this morning
and caught the sunlight creep
ing its way around the edges of
the thick, yellow curtain. Mo
nopolized by the sun's strength
and persistence, the room was
lit up as if the candlelight from
the night before had returned
to set the mood and tempo for
the coming day. A color so
breathtakingly pure that it is
unfamiliar to darkness and
shade. I rolled over onto my
back, looked up at the height
of the ceiling and stretched out
my arms as far as they could
reach. Lifting up my hair from
underneath the layers upon lay
ers of fluffy pillows, I silently
whispered to myself, good
morning sunshine.
Eager to start my day, I
entered the kitchen to have
breakfast. Opening all of the
windows _fn allow the hree_/e to

flow into our dome, I sipped
on a cup of tea, seasoned with
honey and a squirt of lemon
juice, admiring the beauty of a
new day. How happy I am to
be alive, I thought.
Leaving my flat in New
Farm around noontime, I
headed towards the bus station
on Brunswick Street to go to
the computer center in the city
to continue writing. New Farm
is a hip, sort of trendy suburb
of Brisbane, bombarded by a
variety of cafes and bars,
milked daily with the scent of
fresh flowers and the aroma of
fertility constantly circulating
in the air.
When I sat down in front
of the computer screen, I was
anxious to check my hotmail
account. Skimming down the
lone list of new messages, I

came across a note sent to me
by my dear friend Shane Gray
from Gettysburg College. It
was about time he had con
tacted me! I was excited to hear
from him; my hormones were
jumping for joy!
As I read each line of
Shane's note, my heart sunk
further and further into the
depths of my chest; my stom
ach, my feet, and my hands
began to shake profusely. Tears
poured down the sides of my
cheeks onto my shirt, hitting

my slacks. I felt so sick to my
stomach that I immediately
rose from the computer and
stormed outside of the build
ing as if an ice storm were
about to strike down and de
stroy everything in sight. At
that point I almost wished that
it had, because I would have
been relieved from the pain,
anger and guilt that grew like
mold, lining the insides of my
body. In his message, Shane had
informed me that a dear friend
of ours, of all of ours, John

Taylor, had passed away not
too long ago. John Taylor, John
Taylor, John Taylor...the only
thing I could do on my bus ride
home was repeat his name over
and over again in my head,
which hung down to the floor.
I stepped off of the bus at my
usual stop on Brunswick Street
and began to walk. I walked up
and down the streets surround
ing my block crying my eyes
out, wanting to hit any object
that was in my path. A tree, a
fence, the sidewalk, a person;
anything that I could physically
reach out to, just to release my

anger. John Taylor is the type of
person who walks into a
crowded room of strangers and
introduces himself with confi
dence. His smile can bring life
to a wilting flower, and his
laugh, full of soul, reminds you
that every little thing is going
to be okay. Each time I would
see John, he would embrace
me, lifting me up from the
earth, providing me with the
best bear hug a human being
can offer. He rocks my world.
As I reached my front
porch, I looked up into the sky

that had been invaded by fierce,
grey clouds. That night as I lay
in my bed under the covers, the
rain banged against my win
dow. It rained so hard that
night that I thought Noah's Ark
was going to make an appear
ance and sweep away my flat
and all living things. The morn
ing sun that had brought life
into me was struck down into
the bottomless depths of sor
row and fear. That same light
that had inspired me to wake
up and be a productive person
was outcast, and no longer ex
isted. And all I kept saying to
myself as I cried myself to sleep

was, John Taylor, John Taylor.
Where did my sunshine go?
The following day I went to my
friend Krishna's house to use
his computer to type. Trust me,
it is a lot cheaper, and more
comfortable might I add, than
paying for computer access
here in Australia! When we sat
down to our vegetarian lunch,
I mentioned to Krishna that my
friend had passed away. I ex
plained to him as best as I could
that I was upset, angry, and
confused. Yet, my words were
all mangled up and my
thoughts were like a plate of
mashed potatoes.
The conversation that we
engaged in during the preced
ing hour is one that I will carry
with me for the rest of my life.

First, Krishna asked me what
type of person John was.
Proudly, I said that John was a
wonderful person who enjoyed
everything he indulged himself
in and much more. That he was
passionate about watching
beautiful sunsets and soaking
up all of nature's aesthetic
beauties. John cherished the
idea of being in close contact
with the earth and never took
a second of his life for granted.
John knew how to love and
how to receive love from
strangers and thrived off of
meeting new and interesting
people, sharing his experiences
with them. He was a joy to be
around, a striking and unfor
gettable presence of a divine
human being.

Krishna smiled at me, and
I smiled back, although I did
not feel too great. It was then
that he said to me, "Lisa, all of
these qualities that you speak
of about your friend John show
me that he has touched your

life in a very special way. You
say that he was a great person
with unique characteristics and
shared them with every person
that he had met. In my mind,
you not only have admired
John, you have also acquired a
part of his goodness and are
incorporating it into your life."
He continued by saying,
"It is possible that John's job
here on earth was finished, that
he has completed his task of
being the perfect example of a
true human being and has
moved on to a better existence?

May it be, Lisa, that we are only
here for a short time to serve a
specific purpose, and then are
invited to enter into our con
ception of paradise, our own
idea of heaven?" And the last
question that Krishna shot at
me really made me think in a
different light. He said, "And
Lisa, do you believe that if John
was a happy person in this life
that he somehow lost his smile
and his laugh, considering that
he is exactly where he wants to
be, that is in his paradise, at this
very moment as we speak?"

Late last night as I sat on
a wooden porch beneath the
moonlight, I looked up at the
sky and whispered his name,
John Taylor. And as I glanced
around the backyard, the air
was as still as the motionless
clothes hanging from the
clothesline, and I saw John in
everything that surrounded me.
John is that tree with a
strong, healthy trunk and fer
tile leaves. John is that flower,
anxiously waiting to bloom to
shed its scent with someone
who takes the time to sniff it.
John is the breeze in the air that
tickles the back of my neck,
causing me to smile. He is the

raindrop that lingers on the
edge of my eyelash. And most
of all, John is that star that
snines so bright that it captures
the essence of the solar system
and the universe with its
beauty.
In fact, John is sitting on
top of the highest mountain
peak right now watching the
sun rise and set at the same
time, with shooting stars flying
over his head, because that is
where I know he always
wanted to be. And I sang out
loud in praise of John Taylor,
one of the nicest and kindest
people you can imagine...
Wake up to find out that you
are the eyes of the world.
The heart has its beaches,
its home and its thoughts of its
own.
Lay down and discover that
you are the sun that the morn
ing brings.
The heart has its seasons,
that even sings songs of their

own.
The heart has its beaches,
its home and its thoughts of its
own.
Lay down and discover that
you are the sun that the morn
ing brings.
The heart has its seasons,
that even sings songs of their
own.
-The Grateful Dead
And John winked back at
me, letting me know that the
sun is still shining right at this
very moment.
I truly hope that you have
taken the time to read what I
have written. It comes from my
heart and I strongly believe that
everyone should have the op
portunity to share in the cel
ebration of John's new life.

Letters to the Editor

Should the band be banned?
We don't play football during
your concerts," was the com
merit from the usually witty
and entertaining announcer at the
Alumni Weekend football game. Just yet
another negative reaction to the band
on what should be fun Saturday after¬

noons.
This year, the Bullet Marching
Band has been stopped half-way
through songs numerous times.
Whether from the orders of the
opposition's coach or the referees, the
sudden silence has cut through like
Safety 8c Security busting a party. To
cut off music so suddenly is to kill what
ever festive mood was created.
Two weekends ago, in front of the
school's cherished alumni, the music
was stopped yet again. This time, the
referee even threw a flag on the play!
And then, the announcer who is usu
ally cordial to the football team, cheer¬

leaders, and band alike, delivered, in a
very disrespectful and rude tone, the
comment, "We don't play football at
your concerts."
This remark struck band members
in a hurtful way. One musician stood
up, pointing toward the box and booed.
Others grumbled lowly while being si
lenced once again. The band members
sometimes feel as though they are not
wanted or needed. The Bullet Band has
provided a "home field advantage " for
many years. I would venture to say
many Division III football players have
played in front of crowds three times
the size found at Musselman stadium
and listened to much larger bands.

When asked what he thought, Dr.
Jones, the Director of Bands, was dis
appointed that such a negative comment
was announced at our Homecoming
with thousands of alumni present. He

Absenteeism is a dangerous
precedent to set
Last spring, the class of 2000
elected a president for our senior
year. I think every student, es
pecially seniors, will be shocked to find
out that the person we elected is NOT
on campus this semester! When I re
turned from abroad this year, I was
shocked to hear what transpired in the
election of the senior class president last
spring.
I have said little about my amaze
ment since I thought my fellow seniors

elected him knowing he was not going
to be here. So it was much to my sur
prise when dozens of seniors and stu
dent leaders told me that the elected
candidate did not inform anyone dur
ing the election that he planned on go
ing abroad this semester. Since his
planned absence was never brought to
light during the election, the senior class
now has a president that is three thou
sand miles away from Gettysburg.
This is a dangerous precedent that
we are allowing to be set. I ask how
can the senior class and Student Senate
allow this to occur? I ask you, could

Consider This

Are Gettysburg College students trapped in a bubble? Our
Focus question this week polled students to see how much they
knew about current events in the world. Most responded that
they didn't have the time or desire to bother watching the news or
reading a newspaper (The Gettysburgian excluded, of course).
This campus already has a problem with being separated
from the town in which it is located, but are students really that
disconnected from events in the "real world?"
Walk into the Junction any day around

As a liberal arts college, the faculty and adminsitration of this
College have a responsibility to see that students are aware of
what continues to make the world run on a daily basis. This isn't
a call for reinstatement of seventh-grade current events quizzes,
but it is a plea for students to realize that the world is a dynamic
place, one whose history is created on a daily basis.

6 p.m., and you will find three TV screens
showing either the Simpsons or
SportsCenter. Only on extremely rare
occassions will CNN or the national news
be on. Perhaps amid the daily struggle of
homework, athletics and social commit
ments, Gettysburgians do not have the time
to worry about the issues facing the rest of
the country or the world.
Important news about earthquakes in
Turkey, the floods in South or background
on presidential candidates is bandied about
campus like idle gossip. With the excep¬

tion of when class projects are involved,
most students are oblivious to what's hap
pening outside of campus.
A few years ago at a town meeting
Common Hour, a spokesman for the Col
lege described plans to install more "bor
ders and gates" to better distinguish Col
lege properity from the town proper. This
kind of thinking not only is arrogant, but
continues to send the message that stu
dents at Gettysburg College need not worry
about anything beyond our manicured
lawns and fashionable, expensive ward
robes.

too difficult to discern. We
wonder why some things hap
pen the way they do, why little
things happen when they do,
why sometimes you seem to get
the short end of the stick when
you really should get the fat _^
end of a much larger log.
The point is, some
times you're too close to the J
event to notice the differ- I
ence, sometimes you have to
take a giant step back to ap
preciate it. The problem is
that most good things never
become obvious until you've
given up looking for the light
at the end of the tunnel; some
times the windshield isn't de
frosted until you're already
where you need to be.

So where is my conscious
going? Where could I possibly
go with any of this? What it is
all about is hindsight. You can
guess all you want, but in the
bitter end, you never know
what's right and what's wrong

and how you should have acted
until you can't do thing about
it except lament.
Like wading into a pool.
You don't know how cold the
water is until you test it; you
could wade in step by step and
rough it a bit, but in the end
you'll be so comfortable you
won't even notice it. You could
take the instant gratification
approach: jump

Gone fishing

on in. If the water's warm, you
lucked out, if the water's cold,
frozen pork. You've got the op
tions, but you'll never really
know for sure, will you?
Not really. Metaphors,
shmetaphors. Ever try to cook
a small fish in a frying pan? You
ruin it with just a bit too much
poking and prodding. You're
not really sure when it's done
all the time, because all fish are

different that way, but for the
sake of the argument some
times you can just tell. You take
a gut feeling and run with it,
because you can't really do any
thing else.
In this world that every
one seems to have a claim on
but no one really ever pur
chased, it's a wonder anyone
ever finds the fish they're sup
posed to. Some people will sail
_ around and catch nothing,
while others catch some
. thing but end up throwing

_i it back because it's not the
1 best fish they think they can
' find. Even when you think
you've found the right fish,
the cooking might just ruin
an otherwise immaculate
marine animal. Worry not, fu
ture fisherfolks. The seas are
treacherous and loom over the
horizon, but even in this vast
expanse, sometimes by com
plete accident, a fish just shows
up that you know you just can't
ever pass up.

But don't eat the fish just yet - passing star. Like what's in the
because if you stop to check, it frame on the desk, hold on to
might just be the gift you've it and never let go. You might
been wishing for on the last be happy you did.

You hope you'll get the
cooking right, but you have
some strange feeling you can
cook this fishy blindfolded.

Senate rejects CTBT, reaches new low

Is the United States really

Eighty-two percent of
Americans supported the rati

to nuclear disarmament has
been seriously obstructed. The
international community is dis

taking the world a huge step
backwards. All we can hope is
that Congress Republicans, dis

Women's reproductive rights are at
stake in 2000

by Rachel Hanson
Columnist
Two weeks ago, the
House of Representatives voted
on the Unborn Victims of Vio
lence Act and it passed with
most Representatives voting
along party lines.
This bill allows a fetus to
be considered separate from
the mother in criminal cases.
For example, if a pregnant
woman were attacked and her
baby died as a result, the at
tacker could be charged with
murder, giving the fetus rights
and protection under the law
as a person.
There are many oppo
nents of this bill who feel that
this is just a sneaky and under
handed attempt at taking away
a woman's right to a safe and

legal abortion. Though the bill
does not directly apply to
women who are having abor
tions, critics feel that the legal
rights that would be given to
the fetus could later be used to
take away abortion rights.
However, according to
Representative Lindsay Gra
ham (R-SC), who authored the
bill, "this is not about abortion,
but about putting people in jail
who belong there."
This bill is clearly noth
ing but an attempt to limit the
rights that were guaranteed to
women with the Supreme
Court decision in Roe v. Wade
in 1973. However, for now, it
appears that it most likely will
not get very far this year.
There is not enough time
left for the Senate to decide on
the bill and President Clinton
has said that he will veto the
hill the minute it crosses his

desk. He realizes that it would who will best offer this protec
accomplish nothing except to tion.

diminish women's rights under
the law.
If this bill is somehow
made into law, it will be the
biggest setback so far in the
movement for women's repro
ductive rights. It would surely
lead to further restrictions on
abortion access, if not a total
reversal of Roe v. Wade.
For this reason, it is very
important that those who are
concerned with the future of
protecting abortion in America
make well-informed decisions
in the 2000 election.
Every seat in the House
of Representatives will be voted
upon, as well as a third of the
seats in the Senate. These are
the people who create and vote
on bills such as this one. To
guard our reproductive rights,
we need to vote for the person

Who we vote into the of
fice of President will also prove
to be very important. Not only
will the winner have veto
power over the legislation of
Congress, but the President
also appoints justices to the
Supreme Court. And it is felt
that the next President will be
appointing at least three or four
justices. We need to elect a
President who will appoint jus
tices that will not make Court
decisions that will strip away
women's rights.
Abortion rights and guar
antees are not as protected as
some would like to believe. If
we do not make the right deci
sions in next year's elections,
it is very likely that women will
lose a majority, if not all, of
their reproductive freedoms in
a very short amount of time.

Pro-Choice: a misnomer?

by Dan Ballentyne
Columnist
"We must protect a
woman's right to choose," this
is the battle cry of the "Pro
Choice" movement. It might be
more effective if there was ac
tually some substance behind it,
but if you look at the positions
taken on issues, not just abor
tion, you find that "Pro
Choice" doesn't apply. Pro
abortion is more accurate. The
simple fact of the matter is,
they aren't interested in choice,
on abortion or anything else,
but imposing their beliefs on
society.
Nothing illustrates this
better than the reaction of
"Pro-Choice" to two abortion
issues that came up over this
past summer. The first involves
a bill that came before Con
gress requiring all abortion
clinics that receive federal

funds to counsel women
equally about abortion and
adoption. You would think that
"Pro-Choice" activists would
applaud the action, since it en
ables women to make an edu
cated and informed choice.
Did they support it? No,
they opposed it. Why? They
said it was because those clin
ics already do that. Further re
search will show that this is
patently false. In a poll of
women who went to Planned
Parenthood (many of whose
clinics take federal funds), 87%
reported that adoption wasn't
even mentioned to them. The
rest said that they were pushed
in the abortion direction. The
"Pro-Choice" movement does
not show a commitment to
rhmce.

The other issue that came
up was parental consent for
abortion for minors. The rea
soning behind it being two
fold: first that minors are not

yet adults and therefore are not
yet ready to make such a life
changing decision, and second
that if you have to get parental
permission to give a child
Tylenol, you should have to get
it to perform a surgical proce
dure on them.
You would think that the
"Pro-Choice" activists would
be happy with this, since some
one who is emotionally
equipped to do so would make
the choice. Were they? No.
They feel that it is ok for a
school guidance counselor to
take your child to an abortion
clinic without your knowledge.
In other words, the state is bet
ter able to make decisions
about how your child is raised
than you are. In other words
you have no choice.
The non-abortion issues
on which "Pro-Choice" sup
porters don't want you to have
any choice are myriad, but 1
will focus on just one: school

choice. To remind you, the
school choice issue is that many
in our society believe that you
should have the right to send
your child to any school you
choose and not be stuck in the
public schools.
The same people who ar
gue for choice in abortion don't
in how you raise your own chil
dren. They think that your chil
dren should be sent to the pub
lic schools, whether you do or
not you do, because you don't
have the right to choose.
Pro-Choice is clearly a
misnomer; Pro-Abortion
would be more accurate. The
movement's supporters are not
consistent about choice on
other issues, and they have op
posed common sense choice
regulations on abortion clinics.
Why? It must only be because
some people might choose
adoption, and help begin the
dismantling of abortion in
America.

Lack of communication, coherence threatens senior class

BY I.A. LsHf-RWOOD
Social Commentator
In my last year here at
Gettysburg College, I have a
vested interest in seeing that the
senior class leaves a legacy for
those whom we leave behind.
Through these last few years
new friendships have been
made and hard times have been
felt by all, but we have sur
vived. We have survived with
the hope that in May we will
be a close knit group of kindred
spirits all remembering and cel
ebrating our times spent at this
institution of learning.
Recently, however, I have

heard grumblings from the
ranks of my peers as to the state
of affairs in our class, which I
have decided now to make pub
lic. Perhaps 1 am not the best
person for this task, but I am
the one with a column. In ad
dition, I have an interest in see
ing that the views of my peers
and myself are represented.
Just keep in mind that the point
of this column is not to place
blame, and it is not written out
of any sort of malice, but rather
in the faint hope that by rais
ing the issue publicly more
might be done to better the
class in general.

Senior year is a very spe
cial time because it is one of the
hardest years for some of us
and one of the easiest for oth
ers, but in spite of this differ
ence we all have a need for as
sociation with our classmates in
a public setting. What I mean
is we all want to celebrate our
being seniors through events or
parties.
In light of certain difficul
ties, these events have been
somewhat delayed, and the
events which have taken place
in the last few weeks have been
sparse to say the least. We have
had two events so far this se
mester: one was a mixer for
seniors and freshman and the
second was our first senior
party. The highest attendance
by our class was at Saturday's

party, which about one-fifth of
our class attended.
Now there are reasons
for sparse attendance, not all of
which can be blamed on apa
thy (the usual excuse for faulty
planning). For some of us these
events fell at a bad time and we
were unable to attend. Maybe
even for some others we just
did not know about these
events. In both cases a degree
of better communication be
tween the event sponsors and
the class is needed, if not im¬

perative.
The idea of a class being
unified through celebration is
not new. Seniors all across the
country enjoy these types of
events, but without proper
planning and communication,
people will become disgruntled
and feel cheated. The whole
of the class needs to be in
formed and needs to become
involved to participate and sup
port ourselves so that we can
become the class of the new
millennium.

So how will this happen?
Well, it cannot be done by only
three officers this fall, it needs
to be done by the entire class
and on our own initiative. We
need to stop waiting for word
about these events and organize
them from within our own
ranks. We cannot keep wast
ing our limited budget on
events which will not be ap
pealing or convenient for ev
eryone. The last two events
used a bit of our resources
while providing little in return
for the majority of the class.

the Student Senate president do
her job if she was gone for half
of the year? Would you allow
an individual to be captain of
your team if he/she did not
show up for half the games?
If an elected officer
knows that he/she is not going

The situation is not yet dire, but
we cannot afford to wait for it
to become a disaster. We still
have a good bit of this semes
ter left and we can still try to
have a few fun events so that
we can at least form the build
ing blocks of unity, which we
should have by graduation.
It is the intent of the class
leadership to offer certain ser
vice opportunities between
now and the end of the year. I
think that such activities would
set exactly the right impression
and precedent that we want to
leave behind. If our class could
take a lead in helping others in
our own community the we can
safely say that we have benefit
ted not only ourselves but also
those around.

People have asked myself
and others many questions
about Commencement, and it
is necessary to inform the class
about our possible speakers.
The rumor mill at Gettysburg
is churning so fast that some
clarification is needed to avoid
confusion and bitterness. All

to be able to serve half of their
term, I think we should exam
their motives for taking the po
sition. Obviously, the indi
vidual did not take the job be
cause they thought they could
devote the most time and en
ergy to the organization. Could
anyone truly believe that they
were the best person for the job
if they were going to be three
thousand miles away? It is ob
vious in these instances, that
the candidate is showing bla
tant disregard for the institu
tion they say they serve.

While the position of Se
nior Class president comes with
a great deal of recognition, it
also comes with an even greater
level of responsibility. Right
now the other senior class of
ficers are forced to handle all
of the president's responsibili-

of these things need to be de
cided and acted upon now, by
our officers, and by all of us.
In light of these issues,
and in light of the many rumors
and complaints I have heard, I
think we all need to talk more
about the organization of the
class. Once again, three people
cannot run a class; it takes the
involvement and creativity of
many more to make future
events successful. My only sug
gestion is that we, as a class,
have an evening meeting in the
Ballroom soon. Those who feel
inspired and want to come can
debate these issues and maybe
come up with some suggestions
to improve our situation.
Now is not the time to be

ties. In the course of a semes
ter, hundreds of decisions need
to be made by the class presi
dent. Being three thousand
miles away, how can any indi
vidual actively lead any campus
organization?
Even if the president was
in contact through email to his
fellow officers, what kind of
asset can he be to them? Most
importantly, by living in an
other country the president
cannot give ANYTHING (pro
grams, social events, leader
ship, time) to the senior class

or the campus.
It is true that some plan
ning was done this summer be
fore the president left for Den
mark. However, he has not
been here to implement these
plans. As we all know, planning
is worthless if you cannot
implement it. This task has
been left solely to the other se
nior class officers. I have been
amazed by the performance of
our other class officers, espe
cially under this difficult situa
tion. I have been particularly
amazed on how they, especially
the class sercretary, have all

stubborn and pig-headed; now
is the time to improve our situ
ation. Let us master our own
legacy, work together, and for
God's sake, communicate bet
ter. I call for a meeting, a fo
rum if you will, to debate all
these matters openly. More
over, I suggest that this meet
ing take place as soon as pos
sible.

stepped forward in leading our
class. However, is this fair to
them? They did not run for
president, but they are now

being forced to do not only
their own job but also that of
the president. While we watch
our other class officers do all
the work, we know in the end
that they will not be the ones
that receive the credit. For it is
the president that stands before
us at graduation and receives
the faculty and administration's
praise and admiration. This is
simply unfair, because for the
last two months our class presi
dent has been three dedicated
class officers and not the one
we elected.

Some reading this might
say this is unimportant, or that
I am unjustly attacking an in
dividual. Truly, I believe this
has nothing to do with any in
dividual or personal feelings. I
ask you to put your personal
feelings aside, and instead ask
yourself if this is right. This is
very important because our si
lence simply condones irre
sponsible leadership. I simply
believe that the absence of the
senior class president is ethi
cally wrong and unfair to the
senior class and its officers. We
are creating a dangerous pre
cedent by not holding our
elected officers accountable
here at Gettysburg College.

The race for the Republican nomination narrows

by John Dunlap
Political Columnis

Even though we are still
months away from the first
presidential caucus and pri
mary, the race for the Republi
can and Democratic nomina
tions are shaping up. Without
a single vote, four candidates
for the Republican nomination
have decided to forgo their
quest for the White House
based on the popularity and
strength of the front-runner for
the GOP nomination, Gover
nor George W. Bush of Texas.
The latest withdrawal
comes from the former presi
dent of the American Red
Cross, Elizabeth Dole. Mrs.
Dole, the former United States
Secretary of Transportation and
Labor and the wife of the 1996
Republican presidential nomi
nee, former Senate majority
leader Bob Dole, withdrew fol
lowing that of Congressman

John KaMch of Ohio, former
governor and Education Secre
tary Lamar Alexander of Ten
nessee, and the former Vice
President of the United States,
Dan Quayle. Two other candi
dates, Senator Bob Smith of
New Hampshire and commen
tator Pat Buchanan have
switched parties, but their loss
should only help the Republi
can Party, as Smith had no
chance of winning and
Buchanan only hurt the party.
Now he can help destroy the
so-called Reform Party.
These candidates were all
very formidable. Governor
Alexander who was a candidate
for president in 1996 had never
stopped campaigning since that
election. He was well orga
nized but the arrival of George
W Bush crushed his candidacy.
Dan Quayle who served as Vice
President under George W.'s
dad, President George Bush, is
nationally known figure who
while having problems among

the general public over past
mistakes, is popular among
conservatives who have a large
say in the Republican primary
process.
The loss of Elizabeth
Dole is not good for the presi
dential race. Dole's campaign
could have been the strongest
Presidential campaign by a
women. The Dole campaign
had the potential to attract a lot
of new voters and she was do
ing well among women and the
young, which is always a'good
indicator for the political pro
cess. Mrs. Dole added excite
ment to the race and it was
good to see a politically viable
female campaigning for the
Republican party.
I am a supporter of Gov
ernor Bush, but think it is too
bad that Dole will not be com
peting against the governor.
The race for the Republican
nomination should be a con¬

test, not a coronation. Gover
nor Bush, like most of our re
cent presidents is an executive,

a governor of nation-sized
.state. As governor he lias cut
taxes, increased punishments
on criminals, and increased
education funding.
He has attacked the roots
of problems such as juvenile
justice and illiteracy. In the
process the governor has in
creased his support in Demo
cratic constituencies. As a
presidential candidate the gov
ernor has reached out into mi
nority communities and do
nations are pouring into his

campaign. This is due to his
record, his style of campaign
ing, and his family, who is loved
by the American people.
For Governor Bush to
walk away with nomination
would not be good for his cam
paign. He needs to be tested
in good campaign, either Vice
President Al Gore or Senator
Bill Bradley are experienced
campaigners and the Clinton
attack machine will be after
Bush. A candidacy like Mrs.
Dole's could have actually

helped Governor Bush increase
his support among women and
young people, by bringing
more into the Republican Party.
The campaign is now
down to Senator John McCain
of Arizona, a distinguished vet
eran of the Vietnam War, 1996
Presidential Candidate Steve
Forbes, who has his own finan
cial war to fight with Bush, and
Gary Bauer, a conservative can
didate who is attacking the
Forbes campaign for spreading
rumors that he is having extra
marital affairs. Senator
McCain while respected, is a
loose candidate who seems to
have little party loyalty. Forbes
has flip-flopped from 1996 to
be the conservative candidate
and Gary Bauer has little
chance of becoming President.
With Dole gone and these char
acters left, George W. Bush has
almost assured himself the Re
publican nomination.

Peace and Love in the Nineties

by Rick Deutsch
Columnist
I recently saw a comic
strip that wisely stated that
maturity means reaching an age
when you can admit your par
ents may actually be right. Us
ing this as a model, I can't say
that I or many of my peers have
progressed beyond puberty, but
we're getting better at this all
the time.
For example, I called my
mother for advice last week just
before Reading Days. I was
torn between driving home that
night or the next morning, and
she (and two dollar pitchers at
The Pub) convinced me to stay
the extra night. It is invaluable
guidance such as this that has
helped groom us into fine
young men and women, but let
us not forget from where and

when the advice comes.
Historically, there ap
pears to be a positive learning
pattern whereby one genera
tion teaches the benefits of its
time to its offspring, and the
next generation is left with a
new set of morals based on the
old and the new.
This pattern seems espe
cially relevant to our age
group, one which could stand
to learn much from its patents
if it would only listen.
Thoughts of our parents' gen
eration summon images of
pot-smoking hippies flashing
peace signs and, well, smoking
pot. But aside from the lack of
motivation, their experiences
have much to teach us in the
fast-paced and stressful time in
which we live.

I m not suggesting any
thing di astic, like dropping our
PCs and picking up picket

signs, but I'm sure we could
take a good example from then
"do what you feel is right" ap
proach. Because, honestly,
whether or not it happens to
b e ______ you,

rait
there someone you know of
today who isn't doing what
they want, knows it, yet con
tinues to do it anyway?
I'm nervous that if the
current business-oriented trend
that seems to be pervading ev-

eiy aspect of America contin
ues, eventually there wll be no
free _enti) into zoos for children
under the age of four because
someone realized they weren't
maximizing their production.
I was eating dinner with
a group of friends recently and
I was very disheartened to hear
the convei sation go from base
ball to cm i ent stock prices. In
a mattei of seconds, we went
from talking about Derek
Jeter's post-season produc
tion to the opening prices of a
new'merger. It disheartened
me because I couldn't think of
anything more pure to talk of
than baseball, and I briefly
wondered it people would still
go see the Yankees if they
played at PNC Bank Stadium.
1 was even more sharply
reminded of the money
minded thinking of the nineties
when I felt taint from dehydra¬

tion at Woodstock '99, but
couldn't afford to buy another
bottle of water at four dollars
a bottle.
When I think of a defin
ing word to exemplify the
times, I think of the word
"competition," do you not? It's
everywhere and it's what causes
grey hair. As I said earlier, I'm
not proposing an all-out rever
sion to long hair and platform
shoes, but consider this: when
things like the VW Bug and
bellbottom pants come back
into style, don't you think
there's more to it than their
look? Might it not be that
we're looking for something
that we clearly lack ... a little
bit of good old peace and love?
And if you're like me and have
no interest in the new Bug, re
member that you can get it
from listening to Mom and
D,id.

Allies petition

Last week was National Corning Out Week. Every year Allies maintains a table in the CUB where students can show
their support for N.C.O.W by signing a petition to that effect. Those signatures are then published in the Gettysburgian
to show the magnitude of support which exists for an accepting and tolerant atmosphere at Gettysburg College. This
year, over 150 people signed it in three days alone. The statement read as follows ;
I recognize that College is no less difficult than anoy other part of life and that homophobia, intolerance, and
bigotry are found on many college campuses.
I recognize that it is difficult to maintain a supportive and nurturing environment in the face of these things,
whether they are voiced or not.
I recognize that National Coming Out Day is not only a day for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered people to
make the next step but a day for straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered people to reaffirm their support for
an accepting and tolerant environment.
I therefore reaffirm my commitment to a supportive and nurturing environment at Gettysburg for everyone, regard
less of sexual orientation.

Congratulations, Paul!

Women s Soccer

played well throughout the
game. Coach Todd
Wawrousek commented on
the defense.
"They kept the play side
to side; the outside backs
were key to the defense," he
said. He also commended on
the performance of the for
wards. He feels the team has
established some good pair
ings. The Bullets prepared
well for the game at Hopkins,
practicing on turf to become
accustomed to the unfamiliar
surface.
The turf presented a
great challenge to goalie Erin
Hayden, who recorded 5
saves. According to
Wawrousek, "She got more
comfortable as the game went
on. She did the right things
to cut the angles of shots and
made some tough saves."

To conclude the two
week series, the Bullets traveled
to Ursinus on Saturday. Ursinus
was a decent team, but no
match for Gettysburg.
Brewster again played an essen
tial role in the team's victory.
She contributed two
goals within a minute of each
other in the first half. The first
came on an outside breakaway,
with an assist from junior
Whitney Jackson. She fol
lowed up with a 25-yard shot,
assisted by junior Jill Peikarski.
Although the team began
to feel the fatigue of
Wednesday's game, they con
tinued to increase their lead in
the second half.
Rzemieniewski put in the third
goal of the game, assisted by
Cors. Then, Scott finished off
the 4-1 win when she success¬

fully used Jackson's second as
sist of the day.

continued from page 23 -

The Bullets have im
proved noticeably since the
beginning of the season. "We
are really coming together as
a team and starting to play
well," said Brewster.
Many of the players
who had been inhibited early
by injuries or other setbacks
are "starting to open up and
play better," as Wawrousek
has observed. "We are start
ing to get a good mix, and
starting to peak at the right
time," he added.
With only four games
left in the season, all of which
are conference games, the Bullets are
still focused on achieving an
undefeated season.

They are starting to
think seriously about and pre
paring for post-season play.
The Bullets face Swarthmore
away on Saturday.

ior Wes Thurmond.
Sinking the first goal
helped the Bullets immensely.
Pryor said, "We used to
come out flat, so the starters
decided to play high-pressure
and get on them in the first
couple of minutes." He said
the Bullets were lucky to get
out of the Christopher New
port game, as they posed a se
rious threat.
Pryor's goal was his 46th
career goal, breaking Greg

Stevcic's (class of '98) school
record from '97.
Gettysburg's next game
proved less tense, although it
was still competitive. The Bul
Jets played for another shutout,
and the tournament title, with
a final score of 3-0. Pryor said,
since it was for the tournament
and a big game, "It was one of
the best games of the season."
Senior Jesse Flynn scored
24 minutes in with an assist by
Vjshio. Vishio then took his
turn at putting it away just five

minutes later, with Outerbridge
assisting.
Vishio passed the baton
to Outerbridge, who scored
with 5 minutes left, assisted by
Pryor. The Bullets out-shot the
home team 11-4. Vishio was
named Centennial Conference
Player of the week for his per
formance.
Outerbridge was pleased
with the team's performance
and said, "There was excellent
play from both sides of the ball.
The seniors have stepped it up,
and it's been clicking."
La Porta agreed, "The
tournament, all in all, was a
fantastic experience. Everyone
played really well against some
pretty leeit teams."

Finally, in a stroke of
sheer brilliance, the Bullets de
stroyed Swarthmore on Satur
day, 9-0. The following play
ers scored: Pryor, Vishio, Mike
McLaughhn, Pryor, Flynn,
Outerbridge, Vishio, Clayton
Krum, and McDevitt. The re-

Cross Country teams enjoy top ten
finishes at Dickinson Invitational

Teams ' gear up to host Gettysburg Invitational
Centennial Conference Championships

by Jeff Cumpson
Staff Writer
During Reading Days
two weekends ago, the Gettys
burg College men's and
women's cross country teams
took a trip to Carlisle to com
pete in the Dickinson Invita
tional.
The meet was a positive
one for both the men and
women, as both Bullet teams
finished in the top ten.
Twenty-eight teams competed
in the meet, which always
draws stiff competition.

The men's 6th place fin
ish was due in large part to an
other strong performance by
Jason Rose. The junior fin
ished in the top spot for the
Bullets for the second consecu
tive time, and third time over
all, crossing the line in
27:09.55, good for 20th place.
The women were once
again led by sophomore
Kristin Roberts, as her time of
19:22.83 put her in tenth
place. Roberts has held down
the top spot for the women for
all seven meets of the 1999

season.
Other top finishers for
the men included seniors Brian
Holden and Dave Gary, and
sophomores Devin Odom and
Evan Merkhofer.
Gary was awarded the
Golden Cleat for his fine per
formance.
Holden was not far be
hind Rose, as his time of
27:16.35 was good for 26th
place. Gary, in turn, was not
too far behind Holden. His
35th place finish came at
27:34.79.
This string of Bullet run
ners was a positive, but tight
ening the gaps between them
still remains of paramount
concern for the Gettysburg

men. "We see the strategy be
hind other top teams like
Dickinson and Haverford.

They have a pack of runners,
and we need to emulate that
to have the same success," said
senior co-captain Gary.
Odom and Merkhofer's
times of 27:52.67 and
27:59.47 were good examples
of that, as the men's march to
wards the Centennial Confer
ence Championships, which
will be held at Gettysburg,
continues.
On the women's side,
Roberts was helped out by fel
low sophomore Lauren Davis,
whose time of 20:31.32 was
good for 49th place overall.
Freshman Melissa
Hollmann (20:38.53, 56th
place) and junior Kim Heimerl
(20:45.21, 63rd) also ran well,
and sophomore Janel Farrell
rounded out the top five for
the women finishing in
21:14.38, putting her in 100th
place.

Though the women are
still battling injuries and ill
ness, senior co-captain Chesha
Miller felt it was a positive per
formance.
"Though we were
seperated into varsity and JV
races, this was the first time in
my four years every single
woman ran," she said. "It was
great to see us start to pack it
up as a whole team."
Freshman Sarah Barnes
and junior Tara Lord both
earned the Golden Cleat on
the women's side. Barnes
competed and finished her
first collegiate race after bat
tling injury all season, while
Lord ran a personal best.
The Bullets' next meet is
at home on Saturday, October
23 for the Gettysburg College
Invitational. This race should
prove important for the Bul
lets and the other teams in the

Centennial Conference, as the
championships will be held
there next week.
The Gettysburg College
Invitational starts off with the
women's JV race at 10:30, fol
lowed by the women's varsity
at 11, men's varsity at 11:30,

Junior Kim Heimerl placed fourth at the Dickinson

credited with two key defen
sive saves on the day and
Giese had four saves in the
cage to help the Bullets de
fense. "Even though the loss
was very disappointing, we
played extremely well as a
team," said senior defender
Tara Chipko. "We learn
something in every game.
The loss helped us to realize
how much we like to win."
However, the week
end was not over for these
ladies, as they had a chance
to get right back into the
hunt again on Sunday
against no.18 ranked
Randolph-Macon.
With a little over fif
teen minutes left in the first
half, Fisher one timed a ball
into the back of the cage off
of a cross from junior
midfielder Kristy Moore.
At the half the Bullets
still led the game 1-0. Fisher
again scored early in the sec
ond half to sure up the win
for Gettysburg. Giese was
credited with three saves on
the afternoon and Gettys
burg outshot the Yellow
jackets 22-4.
After a much deserved
few days off, the field
hockey team will return to
action on Thursday in a non
league contest at Goucher.
Their last home game of the
season is this Saturday
against Washington College,
a conference opponent.
Side Notes:

Volleyball remains perfect in conference

by Kristin Seaks
Staff Wriifr
Gettysburg's volleyball
team has had much success
since a rough beginning of the
month at the Wittenberg Invi
tational. There, on October 1
and 2, the Bullets were defeated
by Wittenberg, but went on to
win their match against
Kalamazoo 3-1. That Saturday
the . Bullets fell to both
Muskingum and Malone 3-0.

These games served as a
learning experience for the
Bullets, especially for the
younger players. Senior Jenna
McKinsey said, "We're work
ing on our team as a unit, and I
think we're getting there."
Head Coach Kim Kelly
said, "I think that we per
formed well. There were times
we could have performed bet
ter, but overall I think they
should be proud of the adver
sity they handled."

Wednesday, October 6
the Bullets returned to confer
ence play in a match against
Western Maryland College.
Western Maryland is a
strong team in the region, and
this game was important for the
Bullets because they needed to
show themselves capable of
winning after several losses the
previous week. This game was
an opportunity to regain their
confidence.
Gettysburg rose to the
challenge, winning the match
in three games (1510, 15-10,
15-5), and giving Western
Maryland their first loss in the
Centennial Conference.
Games one and two each
had their share of tension in the
match, as Gettysburg's initial
leads slipped away little by
little. However, in both cases
Gettysburg held their ground
and won.

The third game started
off well for the Bullets, who
kept control of the game.

Freshman Lauren Boyd's
strong service game prompted
a Western Maryland timeout at
6-0. Gettysburg continued to
play well, and Western Mary
land took another timeout at 9
2. Sophomore Christina
Giles almost finished the
match, serving the thirteenth
and fourteenth point, but West
ern Maryland won the sideout.
After a few more intense
volleys, Gettysburg took the
match, moving their confer
ence record to 4-0.
The Bullets moved their
record up once again to 6-0
with wins over Dickinson and
Ursinus Colleges on Saturday,
October 9 in a tn-match at
Ursinus.
Lisa Kamin, a junior, led
the offense in the match against
Dickinson with 13 kills and was
also responsible for seven solo
blocks in the Ursinus match.

Senior Catherine Schott
contributed 17 kills in the

Ursinus match, bringing her
total for the day to 27 kills.
For the defense in the
Ursinus match, sophomore
Megan Wargo had 17 digs and
McKinsey brought up 12. The
scores of that match were 15
10, 15-2, 18-16, and 15-3.
With confidence from
these wins, the Bullets returned
to action on Saturday and col
lected two more wins in the
Centennial Conference, boost
ing their record within the con
ference to 8-0. In Saturday's
tn-match, the Bullets competed
against Muhlenberg and Wash
ington at home.
After a shortened week
due to Reading Days, Gettys
burg was rejuvenated to take on
both these teams, winning each
match in three games.

"We played at our pace
and took it to them," said Kelly.
The Bullets took the first two
games of the Muhlenberg
match easily (15-7, 15-6) be
fore they let down a little in the

third game. However, they
pulled through to win the game
15-12.
The Bullets claimed the
first two wins of the match
against Washington (15-4, 15
6), and then ended the day with
a 15-0 win.
Kelly stated, "It was a
great confidence booster to put
away a team like that."
In both matches the Bul
lets were able to play their sub
stitutes. Because of "substitu
tions, neither the intensity level
nor the focus of the games wa
vered at all.
Schott said, "We're get
ting to the point in the season
where everything's coming to
gether."
The Bullets have the
physical capabilities, and are
continuing to build up their
strength and endurance. The
players believe their experience

improved its record to 8-6-1
overall. The women remain
undefeated in the Centennial
Conference, with a 6-0 record.
The four-game winning
streak began Wednesday, Octo
ber 6, with an away match at
Dickinson. In the least diffi
cult game of this series, the
Bullets shut out the Red Devils
2-0. A persevering Gettysburg
team scored both goals in the
last 15 minutes of the game.
First, senior Amy
Brewster changed the scoreless
game with a goal from a direct
kick. With less than three min
utes left in the game, senior
Patsy Cors found the net, with
an assist from Maureen
Minahan.
Coming off the victory at
Dickinson, the Bullets faced a
tough non-conference team at
home. They hosted the Grey
hounds of Moravian on Friday,
October 8.

Junior Rachel
Rzemieniewski opened the
game's scoring in the 21st
minute with a shot assisted by
sophomore Emily McAuliffe.
Just three minutes into the sec
ond half, Brewster put the ball

Near the end of the game,
McAuliffe provided her second
assist of the game to senior
Lauren Scott, who scored her
first goal of the season. The 3-

0 win over Moravian served as
a great confidence builder for
the Bullets.
The opponents played
very aggressively. Captain Amy
Brewster said, "Moravian is a
very physical team, yet our con¬

trol style of play was too much
for them to handle."
This victory was also sig
nificant, because it improved
the Bullets' overall record to
500 for the first time this sea¬

son. The Bullets fed off their
excitement over Friday's win
during their competition at
Johns Hopkins last Wednesday.
Up to this point, Hopkins had
accumulated a 12-game win
ning streak and was ranked
#12 nationally. They also had
the home turf advantage in a
pivotal, mid-season night
game. However, Gettysburg
stepped up to the challenge
strongly. The Bullets defeated
Hopkins 1-0, remaining unde
feated and adding a loss to
Hopkins' nearly flawless
record. The Bullets gained
momentum as the game pro
gressed. In the 77th minute,
Emily McAuliffe fired in the
lone goal off an assist by
Brewster.

Despite loss, offense clicks as Smith rushes into the record books

From Staff Reports
Senior Paul Smith set an
other conference record, but
Gettysburg dropped its second
straight game with a 55-35 loss
at Ursinus on Saturday.
The Bullets' pass defense
woes continued as Ursinus
quarterback Frank Vecchio
threw for 278 yards and five
touchdowns. With the loss, the
Bullets dropped to 1-5 overall,
1-3 in the Centennial Confer
ence. Smith paced the Bullets
with 16 carries for 124 yards
and two touchdowns to be
come the leading scorer in con
ference history with 308 career
points. Smith, the Division III
leader in all-purpose yardage,
rolled up 311 all-purpose yards
on the afternoon.

He needs two more yards
to eclipse the career record of
7,970 set by Carey Bender of
Coe (la.) College.

The humble all-american
fullback, who has rewritten vir
tually every school and confer
ence offensive record, is learn
ing about the milestones along
with everyone else.
"I didn't really know
about a lot of the records," he
said. "People have been just
telling me about what they've
read in the papers. It's nice,
though, to see your efforts re
warded after playing for four
years."
Ursinus jumped out to a
14-0 lead with a pair of touch
down tosses in the game's first
five minutes. Smith answered
on the ensuing kickoff for Get
tysburg, taking the return 79
yards to the Urinus 11. Three
plays later, junior Dennis
Flaherty connected on a five
yard touchdown pass to Pat
Jordan to pull the Bullets
within 14-7 only six minutes
into the game.

But Vecchio answered
back with his third touchdown

strike of the hrst quarter - a 26- yard pass, tapping a hve-play,

Two rushing touchdowns

The past week

In one week

game of the season
in an exhausting
matchup which
ended in penalty

the weekend with a
2-0 win. This win
helped them climb
one more notch in

credited with 18
saves during this
contest.
"I felt like
I just got off of a

roller coaster,"
said White.
"This game was
physically and
mentally ex
hausting. This
win just shows
how close our
team is as a unit,
that we can be
down by two
and have enough
confidence in
each other to

come from behind and come up with
one of our biggest triumphs of the sea
son." Saturday proved to be a game
never to be forgotten by the members
of this squad. In a non-league game
against no. 20 Mary Washington, the
Bullets were defeated in their first loss
this season.
The evenly matched competition
lasted through seventy minutes
ofregulation and two fifteen minute
overtime periods in a scoreless contest.
Next, the game went to penalty strokes
in which five members of each team
were chosen to shoot against the
opposition's goalie.

to win this ballgame.
"With fire in their eyes," the Bul
lets players took the field with confi
dence. And this confidence along with
some excellent goal scoring got the job
done, fast.
Junior attacker Jenni White was
the first to find the cage off an assist
from senior Laura DeSario with 27:40
remaining in regulation. Three minutes
later, senior Amy Stambaugh passed the
ball to junior midfielder Tabitha Gary
who sank the shot from the left past the
goalie.
This awesome display of offense
put the Bullets back in the game 2-2.
