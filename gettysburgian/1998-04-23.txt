Grossberg pleads
guilty to manslaughter

Spring Fest!

Sweetheart of former student faces imprisonment

by Dan Larkin
News Editor

The Associated Press reported
yesterday that the plea agreement
was reached after Grossberg's attor
neys reviewed a transcript of an in
terview Peterson had with prosecu
tors. Peterson reportedly said that
the baby was blue at delivery and
he thought that it was dead.
Peterson also told authorities
that Grossberg had considered get
ting an abortion in the spring of
1996, but decided against it.
Grossberg's lawyers confirmed that
she did consider the abortion.
Grossberg's attorneys main
tained that she believed she was only
four or five months pregnant at the
time of the delivery. She apparently
had a medical exam in July 1996
that did not reveal that she was preg
nant. The teens have both been liv
ing at home with their families, and
have been electronically monitored.
They were each free on $300,000
bail.

Amy Grossberg, high-school
sweetheart of former Gettysburg
College student Brian Peterson
pleaded guilty to manslaughter yes
terday in the death of their infant

son. The child of the affluent teens
from Wycoff, New Jersey was found
in a hotel trash bin in November
1996. Coroners for the state of Dela
ware claimed that the child was born
alive at full term, and died due to
multiple skull fractures caused by
shaking and blunt trauma.
Grossberg and Peterson, both
19, were charged with first-degree
murder after the child's body was
discovered.
Last month Grossberg's attor
neys asked to be tried separately from
Peterson and asked to introduce new
evidence placing blame for the
newborn's death solely upon the
former Gettysburg student.
According to Grossberg's law
yers, polygraph tests showed that she
never saw the child, and thought that
she had a miscarriage.

Peterson pleaded guilty to man
slaughter in the case in March, and
agreed to testify against Grossberg.
His attorney's claimed that he
believed the child to be stillborn, and
put the child in a trash bag per
Grossberg's orders to "Get rid of it!"
Despite the fact that
Grossberg's attorney, Robert
Tanebaum said in March that
Peterson's plea "[did not] change our
strategy at all," it currently appears
otherwise.

Grossberg was set to go to trial
on May 4, and could have faced up
to life in prison if convicted.
She entered the courtroom in
tears and embraced family members
before entering her plea. Like
Peterson last month, she answered
in the affirmative to question if she
understood her actions.
Grossberg's sentencing was set
for July 9, as was Peterson's. A man
slaughter conviction carries a maxi
mum penalty of 10 years.
Deputy Attorney General Paul
Wallace said that the baby's death
"was caused by her chilling indiffer
ence," and felt that imprisonment
would be an "appropriate" sentence
for the teens.

Review celebrates 10th anniversary

Gettysburg
chapter of OBK
turns 75

by Laura Root
Staff Reporter From the beginning, the
founders of The Gettysburg Re
view worked for greatness.
Its first issue was published
January 15, 1988. It had every
thing that the staff wanted—
strong writing, professional pub
lication design, and impressive
artwork.
"We wanted to make what
a literary magazine should be,"
said Peter Stitt, editor of the Re
view. "We wanted to start out
with something really good that
we could base the rest of our
magazines on. No poor publica
tions, not even the first time."
This strong work ethic has
helped to produce one of the fin
est literary magazines in the na¬

tion. The goal of the magazine is
simple. "We want to publish the
best writing in America," said
Stitt. According to its readers and

critics, it has.
The Review has been
home to the works of Ritd
Dove, Donald Hall, Garrison
Keeler, Joyce Carol Oates,
John Barrymore, Elizabeth
Bishop, Robert Bly, E.L.
Doctorow, and Robert Frost.
Three Gettysburg Re
views are published each
year by a staff of four pro
fessionals and three students.
The workers sort
through many submissions
to decide which ones will fit
into the magazine's frame
work best. It usually takes
three months to put an en
tire Review together.
The staff works on sev
eral Reviews simultaneously,
however, so this is only a
rough estimate. Some works
are even ready for next
year's publication.
Poetry, fiction, and
non-fiction can be found
within the magazine. It con¬

tains the work of about 24 au
thors. The Gettysbmg Review
adds to both the literary com
munity and the Gettysburg
College community. It brings
prestige to the Gettysburg Col
lege image and provides the
students with a lively source of
intellectual and artistic mate
rial. To celebrate its tenth an
niversary, The Gettysburg Re
view invited two prominent
writers to come and read at the
College. Last week, former
Poet Laureate and Pulizer Prize
winner Rita Dove read selected
poems.
This fall, Donald Hall
will visit the Gettysburg cam
pus. He is New Hampshire's
Poet Laureate and the winner
of many awards, including the
National Book Critics Circle
Award, a Caldecott Medal, and

from staff reports
The Gettysburg College
chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, Iota
chapter of Pennsylvania, is cel
ebrating its 75th anniversary
this year. Founded in 1776 at
The College of William &
Mary, Phi Beta Kappa is the
oldest honorary society in the
United States. It exists prima
rily to give public recognition
to excellence in undergraduate
liberal arts studies, to promote
liberal learning, and to support
and encourage scholars in their
activities,
The Gettysburg College
chapter was founded on Janu
ary 11,1923.
On Thursday, 45 mem
bers of the class of 1998 will
be inducted into Phi Beta
Kappa, two others were in
ducted in the fall, the initiation
ceremony will be followed by

the Los Angeles Times Book
Prize in Poetry.
Both poets are members
of the Advisory Board of The
Gettysburg Review and are con
tributing editors.
Dove was one of the
original members of the Advi
sory Board. Last week's visit
to campus was not her first.
Ten years ago, all nine of
the Review's editors visited
Gettysburg. Hall has been here
twice. Before Dove read from
her works, she gave a few
words on The Gettysburg Re
view. "It is one of the few
magazines that I look forward
to getting in the mail," she says,
"I can always count on the
good quality."

This year, The _Gettysburg
Review is not only celebratinj
ten years of being, but ten year
of being great.

a special dinner and program
celebration. Anne Fradiman,
the new editor of The Ameri
can Scholar will be the keynote
speaker. The title of her address
is "Procrustes and the Culture
wars". Dr. James Lusardi,
Francis A. march Professor of
English at Lafayette College
and Phi Beta Kappa Senator
will bring greetings from the
phi Beta Kappa society. More
than a dozen Gettysburg Col
lege alumni who were inducted
into Iota chapter more than
fifty years ago will be recog
nized.

Seniors raise $18,300 for scholarship fund

from Staff Reports
The Class of 1998 has
currently raised over $18,300
towards the Senior Scholarship
Prize Fund. The Scholarship,
established by the class of
1996, provides two scholar
ships annually to rising seniors.
The scholarships, presented
during Commencement cer
emonies in May, are awarded
to the man and woman in the
rising senior class who best ex
emplify a Gettysburg College
education. Candidates for the
scholarship must have a mini
mum 3.3 GPA and be involved
in various activities and honor
societies.

The members of the Senior Scholarship Committee with Dr.
Haaland.

The first Senior Schol
arship Prize was awarded last
year to current seniors Dan
Crowell and Lindsey Musser.
Funds for the gift are
raised by the Senior Scholar
ship Committee, which is cur
rently made up of twenty-seven
members, and is co-chaired by
Sara Glatfelter, Rebecca Card,
Brian Rusignuolo, and Mat
thew Eisenberg.
The goal set by the Com
mittee this year was to raise
$19,980 from 50% of the Class
of 1998 by April 24.
Currently the Com
mittee has gotten 44% of the
class to participate, and earned
an unprecedented amount of

Senior Scholarship co-chairs with President Haaland
(from left, Sara Glatfelter, Becky Card, Brian Rusignuolo
and Matt Eisenberg.)

money for the fund. Assistant
Director of Annual Giving
Kristen Anderson attributes the
success of the Committee to the
co-chairs. "They've done an
incredible job and worked re
ally hard," she said.
Though the Senior
Scholarship Prize is a relatively
new program, it is part of a
longstanding tradition at the
College. It grew out of what
was previously the Senior Class
Gift to the College.
Members of the Senior

Class who make a pledge of
$100 or more by June 30,1998
will become members of the
1998 Cupola Society Associates
program.
The Cupola Associates
program allows ' younger
alumni of Gettysburg to play a
key role in the future of the
College that was previously
available only to older alumni.
Students who make a
pledge to the fund now are not
required to pay right away. No
money has to be paid until one
year following graduation.

The response to this sur
vey was impressive...and di
verse. Many people returned
the survey, and it was quickly
discovered that there are lots
of opinionated people here.
And they feel very passionately
about many things.
The problem of "Favor¬

ite Professor" is a good ex
ample of this. Many profes
sors were named as favorite,
but because of this, no one pro
fessor stood out as a clear fa
vorite. We'll just say that many
professors are well loved.
Other random thoughts
on the survey: Wal-Mart falls

under a good number of catego
ries, including late-night hang
out and favorite date location.
The Gingerbread Man got
votes for both upscale and
cheap restaurant.
Originally, 1 thought that
a date on the battlefields was a
very original and romantic idea.

Then I saw how many people
did it. There are an awful lot of
nicknames for 7-11.
Many people gave very
detailed answers to the ques
tions. Or simply mocked me
for asking.
People gave very specific

locations for favorite place to
study. Like, down to the ac
tual chair in the library.
Don't agree with the fa
vorites listed above? Many
people didn't. Maybe The Best
of Gettysburg 2 (date un
known) will better reflect your
opinion.

swinger, and one of the most
popular men of his day.
When his arch nemesis
cryogenically freezes himself in
order to return in a time where
free love no longer reigned,
Austin volunteers to have mm
himself frozen as well. H
When Dr. Evil makes his H
return in the year 1997, the H
Ministry of Defense H
reawakens Austin to put a H
stop to Dr. Evil's fiendish 9
plans. H
After Austin is H
thawed, he must be accli- H
matized to the 1990's. Spe- H
cial Agent Vanessa H
Kensington (Elizabeth H
Hurley) has been assigned H
to help him get adjusted. H
Vanessa is following in the
footsteps of her groovy mother,
Austin's partner in the 60's.
Austin and Vanessa travel from
London to Las Vegas, where
Dr. Evil's underground lair is
purported to be.

Dr. Evil has returned
from his frozen cocoon in a Big
Boy statue floating in outer
space to find that the cover for
his evil enterprise is flourishing.
His henchman, Number Two

(Robert Wagner), has things
well in hand. Virtucon is a
company which makes over
nine billion dollars a year in the
communications industry. Af
ter being frozen for thirty years,

Dr. Evil must be brought up to
speed by his notorious assas
sins. Austin Powers and Dr.
Evil are both travelers from
another time. They bring with
them a different set of values
and each has a difficult time
adjusting to the changes of the
last three decades. Austin is
ready to have a shagadelic time,
just like they did in the sixties.

However, he doesn't re
alize just what has been going
on for the past thirty years. He
has missed the end of the Cold
War, man's first walk on the
moon, and the deaths of his

friends Mamma Cass, Jerry
Garcia, Jimmy Hendrix, and
Janis Joplin.
Dr. Evil is surprised to
learn that there is a hole in the
ozone layer that will contrib
ute to skin cancer, and that
there has been a divorce in the
Royal Family. Each man has a
very difficult time getting ad
justed, but that is what makes
this movie so funny.

Dr. Evil is holding the
world hostage with a hijacked
nuclear missile, and it is Austin
and Vanessa's mission to save
the world from annihilation. In
typical spy film fashion, they
mm are captured and an elabo
H rate death is planned for
H them. Austin Powers is an
H excellent spoof, making
H many references to James
H Bond films.
H Myers is at his best
H when he plays opposite
H himself. In addition to
H playing Austin Powers,
H Myers also plays Dr. Evil.
H In So I Married An
H Axe Murderer, Myers also
_^_J plays a dual role. Myers is
_^P a master of characters, and
movies like Austin Powers
are an excellent showcase of his
talent.

Austin Powers is a lot of
fun to watch, and would be a
great tension breaker during
exams. And if you see this
movie, you'll understand all of
the Austin Powers-speak at the
Bullet Hole and just what your
friends are saying when they
start discussing Fembots. Yeah,
baby, yeah!

Reel Hits & Misses Object of our contention

by Dan Larkin and Mike Petro
Movie Columnists
Mike: The new movie
starring Friends star Jennifer
Aniston is a romantic comedy
known simply as The Object of
My Affection . Aniston plays
Nina, a youth counselor living
in Brooklyn, who meets
George, a gay school teacher,
at a party.
They exchange stories
and George, played by Paul
Rudd (Halloween: The Return
of Michael Myers, Clueless)
ends up moving in with Nina.
Dan: This spring I've seen
more movies staring cast mem
bers of Friends than I ever
thought I would. And remark
ably, I've been pleasantly sur
prised so far. But like all good
things, this pleasant streak has
come to an end with The Ob
ject of My Affection.
Both George and Nina

are people with difficult prob
lems. George has recently bro
ken up with his boyfriend of
four years and Nina is pregnant
by her overbearing boyfriend,
Vince, played in a solid perfor
mance by John Pankow (Ira
from Mad About You).
Needless to say, they be
come fast friends, so much so
that Nina ends up asking
George to help raise her child
when it comes into the world.
The plot moves for
ward reasonably well,
though at times it is a bit /
slow. Aniston and Rudd _^
play off of one another _^H
very well and are believ
able as friends and kindred
spirits.
They are also supported
extremely well by a strong sup
porting cast.

To say that the plot of this
movie is "a bit slow" is quite
the understatement. It drags

and drags and drags. I guess the
intention is to build up sympa
thy for George and Nina, but it
just made me sick of them.
All I could think of was
that Nina had a heckuva nice
apartment _^_±jor a su ppos-

e d I yj_^^^a

«_K_^=

^^_v m e n -
tioned before,
Pankow gives a
strong screen performance,
adding a certain brutish charm
to scenes he's in. Also turning
in strong performances are

Alan Alda, who plays Nina's
brother-in-law, and Nigel
Hawthorne, who plays a gay
theater critic.
Hawthorne turns in a
particularly poignant perfor
mance and I was touched by
the perspective his character
brings to the whole story.
/ did like Pankow and
Alda, but I was unimpressed by
leveryone else. Rudd and
I Aniston are boring and unin
spired. I didn't care about
them nearly as much as I
should have for this movie
_^ to succeed.
H I liked this movie.
_^ I liked the fact that
many of the typical Holly
wood stereotypes were
avoided. More than that, I
liked the minor characters in
here, including the very believ
able one-eyed dance teacher at
the community center.
The Object of My Affec¬

tion may avoid some stereo
types, but the neat, patent end
ing is pure Hollywood sap.
What I did like about the
movie was the fact that it didn't
skirt around the issue of homo
sexuality. Even in 1998, show
ing two men kiss is pretty brave.
I thought that this movie
was going to be funny. It
wasn't. I was supposed to care
about the characters. I didn't.
Two stars (out of five).
This is a good movie
about love, friendship, and the
often gray areas that are in be
tween.
I liked Aniston and I
think she has real potential as
a leading actress in romantic
comedies or romantic dramas.
While I think that this
movie was mis-categorized as
a romantic comedy, as a whole
I like it and enthusiastically rec
ommend it. Three and a half
stars out of five.

Warrior Poets play for Irish children Monday

by Barb Dickson
Features Editor
The Warrior Poets, an
Irish music group made up of
sophomores Ian Isherwood and
Jay Spiese and senior Paul
"Hutch" Hutchinson, will per
form for the last time on cam
pus on Monday, April 27, in the
Junction from 8 to 10 p.m.
The group is performing as a
benefit to raise money for the
Irish Children's Fund and will
be joined on stage by friends.
Hutchinson says the
show will be a "good, rowdy,
fun show. It's late in the se
mester and people need a good
time." According to
Hutchinson, the group wanted
to do a big last show, play some
new songs, and make it worth
something. That's where the
idea for making it a benefit con
cert comes in.

The concert itself will be
free, but the group is asking for
a donation of at least one dol
lar. Anyone who donates more
than $10 may also be given a
tape of an earlier Warrior Po
ets concert, recorded in Febru
ary. The availability of the
tapes has yet to be determined.
The Irish Children's Fund
(ICF) is a group that works to
bring groups of both Catholic
and Protestant Irish children
together in the United States.

The students, all eleven to
twelve years old, live together
for six weeks during the sum
mer and get to know children
not of their faith. Hopefully
they will create friendships that
will weather the trip back to
Ireland and create understand
ing in the war-torn country.
The ICF, founded in
1982, is dedicated to salvaging
some of the joys of childhood
for the children of Northern
Ireland, and to building a foun
dation for future peace. Its

goals are to teach tolerance,
understanding, and respect for
the religious, political, and cul
tural beliefs of others, laying
the groundwork for communi
cation.
Among Isherwood's
many hare-brained ideas (after
forming the group, playing in
the Junction, and getting a job
at Buckley's) is the idea to unite
the island of Ireland with the
music of the Warrior Poets,
"like Bill and Ted," says
Hutchinson.

The group was originally
contacted to perform for
Stephanie Sellars' senior thesis
on Irish music in America.
They thought at first about get
ting a large number of campus
bands together to perform, but
decided the idea would be too
difficult to carry out at this busy
time of the semester.

Friends of the group who
will join them on stage during
the performance include Sam
Goodman, who wrote a song
for them, and Sellars, as well
as senior Joie Bucci and other
seniors. "It's sort of a last hur
rah for the seniors," according
to Hutchinson.
The concert will be vid
eotaped, and a copy will be
given to GCTV
The group was formed
last Thanksgiving, and had
their first performance early
this semester. The Warrior Po
ets have performed at the Junc
tion a couple of times, and per
form regularly at the Irish bar
in town, Buckley's. They may
perform at the bar one more
time before graduation. "My
parents still haven't seen me
perform," commented
Hutchinson.

Hutchinson, after gradu
ating in May, will be working
in Gettysburg next year.
Isherwood, however, will be
studying abroad, so the Warrior
Poets will have to disband.
Hutchinson is thinking of
forming another Irish band.
The new band need to think of
a new name though—they
wouldn't be the Warrior Poets.
Even so, "there's still a
future to the band,"
Hutchinson states, and the
band's future is one to watch.

Jones, Rabbai
perform concert

from press release
The Buzz Jones Big Band,
with special guest George
Rabbai, trumpet and scat, for
merly with Woody Herman's
"Thundering Herd" Jazz Or
chestra, will be Celebrating
Gershwin on Tuesday, April
28, at 8 p.m. in the CUB Ball
room. Doors open at 7:30 and
admission is free. Refresh
ments will be provided.
Rabbai's first national
recognition as a trumpeter
came when he joined the
Woody Herman Orchestra,
touring as a jazz soloist. Dur
ing his two year stay, Rabbai
performed at jazz festivals and
concert halls throughout the
United States and abroad, and
recorded with Herman on the
Concord and Toshiba EMI la
bels.

His unique style of scat
singing prompted Herman to
reinstate and rerecord the clas
sic arrangement of the big band
be-bop hit Lemon Drop as a
vocal feature. Lemon Drop is
also the title of Rabbai's own
CD, released in 1997, on DBK
Records.
After touring with the
Herman Orchestra, Rabbai
was selected as part of the
Woody Herman All-Star small
group, performing with artists
like Sal Nistico, J ake Hanna,
Nat Pierce, George Duvivier_,
Scott Hamilton, and Frank
Wess. He has also performed
as a soloist with the Concord
Jazz AllStars.
As a leader, Rabbai has
recorded with jazz greats Hank
Jones, Rufus Reid, and Mel
Lewis for the Naxos label.

Rabbai's lyrical trumpet
sound is featured in the
soundtrack of Baseball , a film
by Ken Burns, which first aired
nationally on PBS in 1994. He
can also be heard in Burns' epic
documentary The West.
Rabbai has been cur
rently working as a soloist be
hind vocalist Rosemary
Clooney, and is featured on her
"Demi-Centennial: A Girl
Singer's Golden Anniversary"
television special for A&E.

He has also recorded
with Margaret Whiting and
was featured with Tony Bennett
on his television special, "Tony
Bennett With Love."
Admired for his tone,
phrasing and swinging style,
Rabbai infuses his perfor
mances with humor and per
sonality. From his exuberant
scat vocals to his warm
flugelhorn and wide array of
assorted mutes, Rabbai's musi
cal colors fill the complete
spectrum of jazz.
His performing engage
ments have included Carnegie
Hall and the famed Rainbow
Room, as well as European jazz
festivals, New York City's St.
Regis Hotel and many East
Coast jazz clubs.

An active jazz performer
and educator, he is currently on
the faculties of Philadelphia's
University of the Arts, The
College of New Jersey in Tren
ton, and Rowan College of
New Jersey in Glassboro. He
makes frequent appearances at
area schools as a jazz clinician,
festival adjudicator, and fea
tured artist.
John Williams "Buzz"
Jones is the Director of Bands
and Associate Professor of
Music at Gettysburg College.
He is responsible for conduct
ing the Symphonic Band, Jazz
Ensemble, Marching Band, and
instrumental chamber en
sembles.
The Buzz Jones' Big Band
was formed in 1979. It was
started simply as a "rehearsal
band," meaning it was basically
a group of people bonded to
gether through the common
thread of music.

The band became popu
lar by word of mouth, and be
gan doing small gigs. At the
peak of their career in the
1980's, they were playing ap
proximately 100 dates a year.
With Jones' teaching career,
however, they had to cut back.
The band now performs be
tween 12 and 15 times a year.
The concert is sponsored
by the Social Initiative Com
mittee and the Jazz Apprecia
tion Society.

The HIV and AIDS epi

"homo
sexual white male disease" be
cause most AIDS and HIV cases
were found among homo
sexual males. Currently this
disease is prominent among
heterosexual females. The
myth that AIDS and HIV is
only contained within the ho
mosexual community is false
and needs to be addressed.
Anyone, any race, any gender,

The only way to protect
yourself is by abstaining from
intercourse or by you and your
partner getting tested. The
more education there is about
AIDS and HIV, the lower the

number of cases there will be.
The top ten states in
number of reported cases are
(in order) New York, Califor
nia, Florida, Texas, New Jersey,
Puerto Rico, Illinois, Pennsyl
vania, Georgia, and Maryland.
The top ten cities are New York
City, Los Angeles, San Fran
cisco, Miami, Washington
D.C., Chicago, Houston, Phila¬

delphia, Newark, and Atlanta.
AIDS is so deadly due to
its ability to mutate rapidly to
counteract the effects of any
drugs used to resist it. Drugs
used in HIV therapy work by
inhibiting specific viral en
zymes essential to the virus'

normal func
tion or replica
tion. It ih es
sential li you
believe that you
are at risk for
AIDS that you
get tested.
Only about
20% of people
at risk are

tested; this is how the disease
spreads.
In the past year, the death
rate has dropped by half not
only due to the new medica
tions, but also because of the
awareness about the disease,
who it affects, and how it can
be prevented. HIV and AIDS
can affect anyone, so don't
think, "That could never hap
pen to me." It could.

Cancer sticks

by Wesley Thurmond and
Andrew Addonizio
Contributing Reporters
Despite the overwhelm
ing statistics, the tobacco in
dustry still claims that there
is no link between smoking
and cancer. In 1990, it was
estimated that over 419,000
people died from diseases di
rectly related to smoking ciga
rettes. This statistic accounts
for one-fifth or all deaths in
the United States.
Not only does smoking
have health problems related
to it, but the economic factor
is astronomical. Over 97 mil
lion dollars are spent each
year to treat smoking related
diseases. This does not in
clude such things as smoking
related fires, birth defects
caused by smoke, or illness
due to second-hand smoke.

It is know that tobacco
smoke contains 4000 chemi
cals, including 200 known
poisons. This fact alone
shows a great link between

cancer and cigarettes. Smoking
can also cause emphysema and
chronic bronchitis.
The best way to reduce
your risk of cancer is to fully
abstain from smoking. It has
been found that non-smokers
live 25 percent longer than those
who do smoke.
Sidestream smoke, which
is blown at bystanders, contains
higher concentrations of some
harmful compounds than the
mainstream smoke inhaled by
the smoker.
To help fight the war on
smoking, Congress has set regu
lations on the tobacco industry.
All states have banned the sale
of cigarettes to anyone under 18,
and have banned the use of
vending machine cigarette sales.
Many states now ban advertis
ing on billboards and public
transportation.

For a healthier lifestyle for
you and others around you, ab
stain from smoking cigarettes.
Quitting smoking will improve
your health and could possibly
save your life.

Greek tragedy at
Gettysburg

From staff reports
On Friday, May 1, Clas
sical Studies 264, Ancient
Tragedy, will be performing
Euripides' The Phoenician
Women as interpreted
through the eyes of directors
Jeremy Knapman, Travis
Kreider, Marty Masar, John
Meier, and Erich Peitzsch.
The play will take place
in front of Penn Hall, on the
Musselman Library side, and
will begin at 3 p.m.
The Ancient Tragedy
class puts on a play each year
on the reading day before fi
nals. Past plays include last
year's Amphitryon.
Oedipus discovers that
he has just married his own
mother and killed his father
and so blinds himself in pun
ishment. He then hands over
the rule of Thebes to his two
sons which causes conflict and
civil war. Some Phoenician

Women who are trapped in
Thebes witness the horrors of
the war.
This play, written in 410
B.C. and considered to be among
Euripides' most famous works in
Plutarch's time, about the con
flict between two brothers at
tempting to gain the heritage of
their father's land, is a great rep
resentation of a typical Greek
tragedy.
Euripides, who began writ
ing plays at the age of 18, wrote
approximately 92 plays, of
which 18 remain. He was the
third of the three great Greek
dramatists, Aeschylus and
Sophocles being the other two.
He was quite popular in his
own time and was the object of
satire by Athenian writers of
comedy, particularly
Aristophanes.

Come out on the reading
day at 3 p.m. and see how Greek
tragedies were performed way
back in ancient Greece.

CONFLICT & Consensus

Everyone Should Study Abroad

enough, I chose to come back

To the Editor:
Disclaimer: Any sarcas
tic, negative comments di
rected at a particular group
on campus is merely a gener
alization that is not meant to
offend any individual.
As a graduating senior,
I spend a lot of time reflect
ing on the past four years. We
are all aware of the debates
that have spilled across the
pages of The Gettysburgian
with the two most volatile is
sues being Greek vs. Indepen
dent and diversity. Before

you stop reading, I assure you
that this is not another poorly
written, squashy stream of
complaints about the institu
tion we all chose to attend. I
assume that all the students
at Gettysburg College are
here out of their own free
will; if not, well, I can't imag
ine anyone being dragged
kicking and screaming by
their parents to a college that
costs $30,000 a year. Finan
cial issues are not my concern
in this letter, but I can con
tinue along the theme of "free
will."

At first glance at all the
Greeks running around doing
juvenile things because a fel
low brother or sister tells
them to, and at the flocks of
sheep that thunder into Servo
every evening, Gettysburg
College does not seem like
the ideal place to grow as an
individual. Yet, adversity of
ten sprouts integrity, just as
suffering allows one to feel
and appreciate happiness to
a greater degree. Take me as
an example of this sociologi¬

cal phenomenon. After one
semester at Gettysburg, I was
ready to transfer. But I'm still
here. Why? Besides the fact
that I never actually applied
to any other schools, I rea
soned that if I go abroad for
one full /ear, three years
won't be so bad. Actually, it's
been pretty darn good. I
would say that the best thing
that Gettysburg has done for
me is provide me with the
opportunity to expand my
education into the world.

Isn't that what we're all here
for, to learn about the world?
Gettysburg is far from being a
microcosm of planet Earth (it's
probably closer to Mars, since
we're so ahen-ated...ha ha);
behold the necessity of study
ing abroad, or spending some
time off-campus in a more di
verse community via a service
learning project, for example.
One does not have to
leave the country in order to
experience "diversity" (for lack
of a better word); go to New
York City, Arizona, or the Sea
Islands and you will discover
that the United States does not
lack culture; too many students
are just too sheltered in their
personal lives to realize or care
that it exists. Yet, the many
colors of America make up only
a fraction of the prism. Every
student should go abroad at

some point during his/her
higher education. I do not
mean a two week European
vacation, American style. I
mean whether it is two weeks
or two years, one must live in
another country. I have heard
students complain that spend
ing a semester away from Get
tysburg would interfere with
his/her major or that it is too
expensive. Getting away from
Gettysburg does not necessar
ily mean physically leaving
Gettysburg during the aca
demic year. There are many
abroad opportunities during
the summer; you can even le
gally work in some countries,
and get a practical as well as
cultural experience. As for the
cost, a semester at Gettysburg
is more expensive than some
study abroad programs. I do
not wish to ramble on like a

study abroad brochure, so for
more information contact
Rebecca Bergen at OffCampus
Studies. The important thing
is to open your mind beyond
Gettysburg, because, as St. Au
gustine said, "The world is a
book, and those who do not
travel, read only a page."
That brings me back to
the idea of free will. I chose to
go abroad, and surprisingly

If I could have completed a
degree in England or France
(where I spent my junior year,
respectively) I probably would
have stayed. But for conve
nience and to please my par
ents, I reluctantly came back to
Gettysburg. I came back ex
pecting everything to be the
same, and weekends to be spent
sighing in my room looking at
photos of my European travels,
reminiscing about wild nights
in pubs and clubs. But, some
thing had changed. Weekend
thoughts went from "what to
do, what to do" to "what can I
do...I can do this, this, or
this..." without even thinking

about leaving campus. I left the
Dive to return to the Junction.
(Of course, I knew about the
renovation before leaving, but
it was quite a shock anyway).
Whether it's the coffeehouse,
a concert, a speaker, a poetry
reading, weekend or weekday
the Junction is never left in
bubbling emptiness (allusion to
the bubbly pillars of the Dive).
Along the lines of improved
social programming are BYOB
events, and talk about building
a bar and maybe even a dance
club on campus. So congratu
lations to SAC and others for
their efforts in making Gettys
burg a better place to party.

In addition to the long
awaited changes that have fi
nally come forth and those that
are in the midst of creation, I
have noticed a slight decrease
in the student apathy for which
Gettysburg College is s known.
There may not be less com
plaining, but there is definitely
a lot more doing. Unfortu
nately, these changes have not
affected everyone. The echo of
"there's nothing to do here" is
still in the air. And though
there are more minority and
international students than my
first year, I still smell a cloud
of intolerance floating around.

Consider this

When it comes to getting
students fired up, the best in
stigator isn't a anti-Greek ar
ticle but the debate over
Macintosh versus PCs.
There are too many con
sequences for Gettysburg to
become a PC-only environ
ment, just as converting to all
Macs is unreasonable.
The College supported
Macintoshes when the Classes
of '98, '99, and '00 arrived.
Ironically, at those times, one
of the College's selling points
was that it had equal numbers
of Mac and PC labs, yet the
current proposal threatens to
exclude the computers that the
College endorsed for students
prior to their enrollment.
Denying support to Mac
users is not only unfair but
unjustified. The resources to
maintain those machines on
campus are minimal. This
move will not reduce the num
ber of computers on campus
but simply shift the balance to
PC, a type of machine not
without its own faults.
The Mac phaseout would
alienate too many incoming
students that would want to
bring their Macs from home.
Such drastic measures would
also cause students who own

Macintoshes to feel obligated to
purchase a PC system-another
expense to discourage would
be students.
While Mac-bashing is
trendy, the facts are that new
Macs have faster processors
than the Pentium II, are easier
to use and network (although
PCs are quickly learning that
Apple is on target and has be
gun to follow the Mac lead),
and are better for graphic arts
and publishing applications.
While the cost of updat
ing the Mac labs with new ma
chines has been argued, a col
lege that wants to upgrade its
academic standing should not
fear expense when it comes to
purchasing cutting-edge tech
nology to bolster the education
of its students.
Macs and Mac clones are
still used in the "real world"
that college prepares us for.
The real world uses a lot of dif
ferent kinds of computers, and
learning any one of them
should be ample preparation
for working in the Information
Age. The question should not
be Mac versus PC but rather a
matter of allowing students to
use the operating system of
their choice.

Republican changes now can mean big gains in 2000

by John Dunlap
Political Columnist
This week Republican
congressional leaders dumped
the entire United States tax
code into Boston Harbor as a
way to show their desire to
change the burdensome and
overly large federal tax sys
tem. Once again, the GOP
hopes to stand with our revo
lutionary forbears. However,
over three years after a Re
publican Revolution was pro
nounced, Republicans seem to
have lost their revolutionary
zeal. In 1995, Republicans
entered Congress in the ma
jority for the first time in forty
years. Seventy-three fresh
man Republicans in the
House o'f Representatives
were setting the tone and had

a Contract on America to work
from. They wanted a balanced
budget, tax cuts, regulatory re
form and tort reform. Today we
have a balanced budget, we have
received some tax cuts (but not
nearly enough), and no regula
tory or tort reforms. This is not
the complete fault of Republi
cans. The first one hundred days
of the Republican majority were
remarkable. They kept all of
their promises and had pre
empted the President. Bill
Clinton was forced into arguing
that he was still relevant. Within
a year, the White House spin
took over, along with a media
onslaught against House Speaker
Newt Gingrich of Georgia. On
the issue of the budget, the presi
dent demonized Republicans,
and things only got worse in the
1996 presidential campaign.
The 1996 Republican

nominee for the presidency,
former Senate Majority Leader
Robert Dole, seemed out of
touch with the conservative
movement and ran a poor cam
paign. In congressional races,
Republicans kept with the mes
sage and held on to Capital
Hill. 1997 would bring a still
divided Washington, but now
Republicans seemed afraid of
the president. The budget was
balanced, but no major reduc
tions in the size of government
were made and taxes are still
too high. Republicans talked
up tax reform but have only
held hearings, and GOP lead
ers are still divided. Speaker
Gingrich has survived one coup
attempt, and Majority Leader
Dick Armey has come under
assault by Republican sopho
mores in the House.

Just recently the days of
the old Democratic pork-bar
rel politics came back to the
House and Senate as a pork
barrel transportation bill was
passed. Its main author was the
Republican version of the
Democratic Senator, and pork
barrel king, Robert Byrd, Bud
Shuster of Pennsylvania.
Gettysburg's own history pro
fessor Norman Forness said it
correctly in his Urbanism in
American History course when
he stated, "Republicans know
how to spend when they want
to." The GOP is great at talk
ing tax cuts and reduction, but
Washington has trapped them.
Do not get me wrong,
things are much better than
they were four years ago when
we had an off and on liberal
Democratic president and
Democratic Congress. In

1994, the talk in Washington
was of tax increases, national
ized health-care and increased
government spending. Repub
licans have given us welfare
reform, the line-item veto and
health-care reform that Presi
dent Clinton could not deliver.
Republicans can get back
on track by maintaining the
Congress this year and electing
a President in 2000 who favors
basic reforms such as tax re
form. I do believe that repub
licans should just not wait the
Clinton presidency out. They
should be pushing for com
mon-sense reforms and debat
ing the president on the key is
sues of the day, not just watch
ing for the next presidential
scandal.
We have the majority for
the first time in forty years.
Let's do something with it.

CONFLICT & Consensus
Bothered "brother" bashes 'burgian

To the Editor:
In search of some
amusement, I decided to read
The Gettysburgian. As usual,
I was provided with hours of
laughs from this poorly writ
ten, researched, and pre
sented excuse for a paper.
Specifically, I chose to make
this overreaching generaliza
tion to stoop to the level of
your authors. Many instances
in your paper have been por
trayed in highly biased and
stereotypical fashion.
Instead of focusing on
this endless list of previous
mistakes, I would like an ex
planation from the nameless
author in the "Consider
this..." section of the paper to
defend his or her statement-

that "brothers were allowed to
continue their repulsive lifestyles
off campus." This statement is a
horrendous accusation. Assum
ing that you are somewhat edu
cated here at Gettysburg, igno
rance cannot be your excuse.
All-inclusive statements are
wrong both morally and ethi
cally when referring to a group
of people. Also, being a fellow
"brother," I'm extremely in
sulted that you have described
my lifestyle as "repulsive." Please
step off you pedestal and stop
judging others.
Also, I would like to com
ment to the people of the "Ha
zel Alley Association." Your
town is a fine town, but most of
the time your "townie" mental¬

ity is part of the problem. I
would like to know the answer
to a few trivial questions: Why
do the Gettysburg police wait
in the Ice House overflow lot
to give tickets to college stu
dents? Why are all the meters
in town free during the Christ
mas season while the college
meters are still ticketed? How
is Crack Alley coming? Are
there still bar fights once a
week at Hamilton's? Why am
I harassed and annoyed by loi
tering high school children at
7-11? Also my most important
one, Why do some of the land
lords charge -astronomical
amounts of rent to college stu
dents? The town is selling their

soul to rent their properties and
they still have the audacity to
complain when college kids do
not treat them with respect.
Basically, I would like to say
that some of the landlords here
are thieves. As college students
we are very limited in the prop
erties that we can rent. Have
some integrity and break up
your monopoly of rental prop
erties and earn the respect of
the students. I can site numer
ous examples of houses that
four to six college students pay
more than $3,600 per person
to rent a house for one year that
often does not include utilities.
Also, these rentals are often
safety hazards and show land
lords' ability to count money,

but not to spend it. I just don't
understand how the rentals in
Gettysburg can be priced like
they're on Park Avenue. Actu
ally, I think I know why—Be
cause we have no choice if we
don't want to live on campus.
Wake up Gettysburg and stop
playing this elitist game. You
complain about empty kegs and
I'll complain about
Gettysburg's homeless, va
grants, crack, and thieving mo
nopolistic landlords. Don't
you people have something
more worthwhile to attend to?
I know I do.
Sincerely,
Michael J. Holm '99

Tragedy

To the Editor:
I bemoan the musical
tragedy that occurred in the
CUB on Saturday, April 18.
Ziggy Marley and the Melody
Makers were wonderful as
usual (I think), but our ears
were deprived of the experi
ence. Why? Because the deep
bass was cranked so loud that
it distorted and covered the rest
of the sound spectrum. This
made it virtually impossible to
hear the lyrics, or to appreci
ate the subtlety of the instru
mental mix. I felt as if I were

being buffeted by the wind, and
it rattled my entire body.
I complained to three dif
ferent people by the sound
board, none of whom seemed
neither to have any authority
nor care to pass the word to
anybody who did. When I
spoke to the man in charge as
he walked by me, he wouldn't
and/or couldn't hear me. Ev
eryone else I talked to agreed
with me that it was too loud,
including both students and old
fogies like me.
Ziggy's brand of reggae is

joyful, spiritual, and (often)
lyrically significant. It doesn't
need to be blasted and distorted
to make an impact. And it
wasn't when I heard them at
Yale 4 1/2 years ago. What a
pity that Gettysburg College
was deprived of a similar ex
perience due to the behavior of
the contracted audio firm that
handled our concert.
After an hour I gave up
and left. Outside the building

I saw people dancing to the
sound of "Raw Riddim" and
rattling windows. At home I
played my three Ziggy Marley
CDs to replace bad vibes with
good. We have heard great con
certs in the CUB before. I'll
never forget Squeeze and Flock
of Seagulls in the early 80s, and
the more recent Violent
Femmes concert. It can hap
pen again if somebody can con
trol the sound contractor.

Sincerely,
Charles F. Emmons,
Music lover

For the past five years
Professor Edward G. DeClair
has given his knowledge and
foresight in an effort to better
prepare his students for the
adversities they may face in the
real world. His unique style of
teaching, while sometimes con
troversial, offers his students an
educational experience wholly
different from the rather bor
ing and mundane styles so
prevalent on this campus. His
methodology of treating his
students like the adults they
supposedly are and should be,
along with his refusal to mol¬

lycoddle those who have no
desire to learn, often offends
people. Yet for those who wish
to receive an excellent educa
tion, above and beyond the ut
terances of a textbook, he
shines as an educator who
genuinely cares about the well
being of his students. It is our
position that the denial of ten
ure to this excellent professor
was a grave mistake, made by
those who care too much about
catering to the infantile few and
not enough about the values of
a superior education. Yet this
forum is not for rehashing is¬

sues that have long since passed
us by, but instead, formally say
ing goodbye to the man who
gave many of us the greatest
educational experience of our
lives. While many who have
taken a class taught by Profes
sor DeClair may agree with the
statements made in this article,
only those who have taken his
European Union: Policy and
Progress course can appreciate
fully, the professor, the man,
and the paramount importance
of his presence. The culmina
tion of a semester of immense

work and research is the Euro
pean Union Simulation in
Washington D.C. The three
day simulation is not only an
opportunity for students to use
the acquired knowledge in a
practical manner, but stands
alone as the only practical uti
lization of knowledge, incorpo
rating both academics and life
skills. For those who partici
pate, a commitment is made
not only to Professor DeClair,
but to their fellow students as
well. It is a commitment to
learn and work together, not
only through the course of the

semester, but representing Get
tysburg at the simulation,
which involves thirteen other
schools. Each year this simu
lation is dominated by Gettys
burg and this year was no dif
ferent. From December 4-7,
Professor Declair's students
performed at a level that far ex
ceeded their colleagues from
other schools. Their level of
preparation was noticeably bet
ter than the other participating
schools. For its participants,
obvious credit should be given

to Professor DeClair for pre
paring his students in a man
ner that allowed them to rep
resent Gettysburg in a way that
all would be proud. To profes
sor DeClair, who gives so much
of his time to insure the suc
cess of his students, we say
Thank You. You have given us
memories, which we shall
never forget; for that we are
eternally grateful. Wherever
you may go, you will be re
membered not only as a great
professor, but a wonderful man
as well.
Thank you and good
luck!

EU class. Fall 1997

To the Editor:

For almost two years I
have observed the system of
our residential staff. In this
time I have come to the con
clusion that this system is a
mockery of the same ideals that
Gettysburg College so fervently
espouses: unconditional equal
ity and unbiased action. The
first page of the Student Hand
book states that, "It is the
policy of Gettysburg College
not to discriminate improperly
against any matriculated stu
dent, employee or prospective
employee on account of race,
color, religion, ethnic or na
tional origin, age, gender,
sexual orientation, or being dif¬

ferently abled."
However, the college
gives distinct and empowering
abilities to a select few and
leaves the vast majority impo
tent and "differently abled." As
mere matriculating commoners
we are left to the disposal of
the elite R.A. class. This is not
equality. One can respect the
logically-appointed hand of a
college administrator, but he
surely cannot respect the im
pulsive fist of his fellow stu
dent. It is hardly uncommon
for R.A.s to become authoritar
ian or experience delusions of
grandeur. And all too often

there is a grievous abuse of
authority. R.A.s are best
known for their unwarranted
"power-trips" and wanton dis
regard for their fellow students.
Like the Gestapo of old,
R.A.s frequently take pleasure
in the misfortunes of their resi
dents. They notoriously boast
of their citations, trophying the
enormity of the subsequent
fines. Concepts of fraternity
and confidence are surely lost
in this deceitful power struc
ture. R.A.'s need nothing more
than the cross of a "t", to be
seen for what they really are:
RATS.

Abroad

-from
Experiencing other cultures is
the way to dissipate that
cloud...if only every student
was required to experience
other cultures (because some
irrationally choose not to),
whether by going abroad, do
ing a service learning project,
or some other way...but per
haps I am being too hopeful.
All I can do, as one who is de
parting, gladly (because I'm
ready to move on), yet sadly
(because I wish I could be
around a little longer to ap-

page 11
preciate the wonderful
changes that have been hap
pening here and help initiate
more) is encourage those who
remain: go away, but while
you're here, do something.
Gettysburg College is finally
progressing rapidly; it can
only be blinded by the cloud
when people refuse to see the
beauty outside, and reel that
beauty in with persistence and
enthusiasm.

Dr. L. Car ) Leinbach, Gettysburg
College, "What Is This Matrix

Matrices, or tables of numbers, are
representations of operators on a
vector space that preserve the
essential operations of vector addition
and scalar multiplication. They have
applications in many important areas
including mechanics, fluid flow,
ecology, probability theory, engineer
ing, and communications. A key to
understanding the behavior of a
matrix is its factorization. In this

simple, albeit incomplete, example

Forget about raising the roof... raise the rim

by Bill Davidson
Staff Reporter
Basketball is a game ot
passing, cutting, and shooting
that requires skill, balance, and
grace. This is still true at the
amateur level, but the National
Basketball Association (NBA) is
another story. Taller, stronger
athletes dominate the game. To
continue popularity, the NBA
needs to adjust its rules to ac
commodate these phenomenal
players.
The evolution of NBA
athletes is evident when com
paring teams of different eras.
The average height of the
1959-60 World Champion
Boston Celtics was 6'4", while
the 1997-98 Los Angeles Lak
ers average a height of 6'8".

During the 1960_'s a leg
endary giant dominated the
NBA. Wilt Chamberlain, a 72"
giant possessing astounding
speed, towered over the com
petition like a redwood in a
scrub forest. His supremacy
peaked in the 1961-62 season
when he averaged an unprec-

¦e de _ited hfty points per game.
To reduce Chamberlain's domi
nance, the NBA intervened,
widening the three-second lane
by four feet, forcing him to play
farther from the basket. The
rule change was needed, and it
worked to a certain extent.
Since the 1960's, the aes
thetics of the game have
changed. Today, there are sev
eral NBA centers with Cham
berlain-like attributes. Patrick
Ewing, Shaquille O'Neal, and
David Robinson all possess ex
ceptional speed and jumping
ability to accompany their tre
mendous height. Guards and
forwards have also followed
this trend. Tall, rangy athletes
_snch as Eddie Jones have cre
ated a new generation of guard
play-

Forwards close to 7' such
as Kevin Garnett possess the
agility of guards. As a result,
these oversized players have
created a claustrophobic game
above the rim. To counter this,
the NBA needs to make a
monumental rule change that
would drastically improve the

game. Raising the basket six
inches would revive passing,
cutting, and shooting, ingredi
ents which used to be essential
in the NBA. All NBA players
would need to utilize funda
mental skills. Dominating cen¬

ters and leaping forwards
would no longer be able to
dunk at will. Instead of dunk
ing, they would need to en
hance their Herculean power
with finesse. Undoubtedly
these players would respond to
this change by developing their
skills, thus restoring the purity
of the game.
The majority of dunks in
a NBA game are no longer en
tertaining. Watching giants

such as Shaquille O'Neal barely
leave the ground before thrust
ing the ball through the hoop
is simply not fun to watch.
Raising the height of the rim
would solve this problem.
Most players would still be able
to dunk, but they would do so
less frequently. Therefore,
dunk shots would once again
be appreciated. And, fans
would respond to the fresh
game above the rim.
The six-inch theory faces
three common arguments.
Most people feel that the his
tory oi the game would be jeop
ardized, making past, present,
and future records incompa
rable. Second, people who
think the height adjustment is
a good idea are still skeptical
because they feel all baskets at
every level of play would need
to change accordingly. Finally,
many critics feel the change
would hamper shooting.

The NBA, like most pro
fessional sport leagues, has
tinkered with subtle rule
changes throughout its history.
In 1979 they added the three
point arc to generate more

scoring and in the process cre
ated a more enjoyable game for
fans. A rim adjustment in high
school or college basketball
would be ludicrous. At these
levels, the game is played in its
purest form, below the rim.
Only in the NBA are seven
footers abundant. Only in the
NBA do 6'10" forwards possess
forty-eight inch vertical leaps.
Only in the NBA does the av
erage guard approach six-and
a-half feet.
Incoming players would
need time to adjust to the dif
ferent rim height, but the tran
sition would not be difficult.
After several weeks of practice,
any player would realize that
it is not a substantially higher
target at which to shoot.

For NBA fans there is
no need to panic. The game
will not be ruined. Kobe
Bryant would still deliver acro
batic dunks; Reggie Miller
would still drain three's, silenc
ing raucous crowds; and
Michael Jordan would still be
the most talented man to ever
play the game.

Bullet bats battling barrage
of close games

Assistant News Editor
The Bullets used this past
week wisely by scoring two big
wins and continuing to nail
down their chances for the
Centennial Conference cham
pionship.
Consecutive victories
over Dickinson and Swarth
more, both conference oppo
nents, improved the Bullets'
record to 8-3, 5-0 in the con
ference, and ensured at least a
share of the conference crown.

Last Wednesday, Gettys
burg travelled north to Carlisle
where the Dickinson Red Dev
ils were looking for their first
conference win of the season.
The Bullets severed what hopes
the Devils may have had by
racking up a dominating 27-2
win, where fifteen different
players scored for the Bullets.
Jamie Bateman and Scott
Lowery each tallied five goals
in the win. In the past two sea
sons the Bullets have beaten
Dickinson by a combined score
of 57-4.

On Saturday, the Bullets

Spring Fest. Jamie Bateman be
came the seventh player in
school history to score at least
100 goals in his career.
Bateman racked up six
goals on the afternoon, includ
ing four and one assist in the
first quarter when Gettysburg
jumped out to an 8-0 lead.
Only the final whistle could
stop the Gettysburg onslaught,
but not before they had in
flicted a 22-3 drubbing on the
visiting Scarlet.
Scott Lowery turned in
another well-balanced perfor
mance against Swarthmore by
scoring four" times and handing
out four assists. On the week,
Lowery scored nine goals on
just eleven shots and registered
six assists. His outstanding play
landed the senior captain on
this week's conference Honor
Roll.

Bateman is presently the
fourth-leading point scorer in
the conference with 34 goals
and 9 assists (43 pts.). Lowery
is seventh with 19 goals and 20
assists (39 pts.), and Ross
Garretson is eighth with 22
goals and 11 assists (33 pts.),
despite battling a leg injury the

Gettysburg face-off man Lee Hemming battles for this free ball

Staff Reporter The Gettysburg Bullets
have won three out of their last
four games. Last Saturday, the
Bullets swamped struggling
Swathmore College and
pounded out two wins in both
ends of a double header.
In the first game, Paul
Koether picked up his 5th win
of the season. Koether only
gave up three hits in his seven
innings of work. John Woods
went three-for-four with an
RBI and Kevin Grimm had two
RBI's to pace the Bullet offen
sive attack.
In the second game,
freshman Jeff Ellis picked up
his second win of the season.
Bill Neston was three-for-four
with and RBI; Drew Lavenburg

tysburg All-Atnencan Jake
Kovalcik '96. Presently, Barter
has stopped an impressive 75.3
percent of his shots faced. The
next best percentage, held by
Franklin &c Marshall's Marc
Pascal, is 62.1 percent.
Gettysburg, which is cur-

was two-for-four with two RBI;
Chris Lunardi and Daryl
Clancy each had two hits
apiece; and Bill Beining put the
finishing touches of with a two
run triple. On Monday, the
Bullet's traveled to Lancaster to
face Franklin & Marshall Col
lege. The Bullets won 10-8
behind the strong pitching per
formance of Drew Chiesa.
Chiesa (3-2) struckout eight in
eight innings of work.
P.J. McElroy worked a
perfect ninth inning to pick up
the save. To top of a streak of
smoking hot play, Lunardi hit
a game winning three-run
homerun to seal the win for the
Bullets in top ot the ninth.
Freshman catcher Kit Wannen
made an immediate impact in
his first varsity start going 3-4
with 2 RBI's.

vision III polls, travels to F &
M this Saturday for their final
conference matchup. A win
against the Diplomats will en
sure the Bullets an outright
Centennial Conference cham
pionship and a berth in the
NCAA Tournament.

Yesterday the Bullet's
lost a heartbreaker to Messiah
College. The Bullets overcame
a four run deficit in the first
inning with three runs in the
first and two runs in second.
The Bullets' held the lead until
the ninth when they gave up
four runs.
Tom Boob pitched well in
the loss, only giving up 1 run
in his time on the mound. John
Woods, Bill Beining and
Lunardi all made significant
contributions to the Bullets's
five runs, but in the end Mes
siah was the winner.
The 16-13 Bullets have
five games left on thier sched
ule, including games versus
conference rivals Franklin 6c
Marshall, and Washington Col
lege. Their other remaining
games are against York College
and Lebanon Valley College.

Staff Reporter The Lady Bullets finished
up the regular season with a
series of matches. Last Wednes
day, the Bullets took on West
ern Maryland, a team who is
in the midst of a formidable

season.
Doubles action fell in the
favor of Western Maryland as
all three doubles teams fell in
tight eight game pro-sets. Al
though it would be a challenge
having to come back from be

the match.
It was imperative that the
Bullets get off to a good start
in singles. The Lady Bullets
rose to the challenge to stage
the comeback, sweping the
singles and the match 6-3.
The biggest match of the
season had the women's tennis
team traveling to Franklin 8c
Marshall for the conference
showdown. Defeat of F & M
would make Gettysburg co

The match was a com

Despite skid, laxsters learning

from Staff Reports
As of late the young Lady
Bullets lacrosse team has been
running into some tough com
petition. The Bullets have been
playing well, but their oppo
nents have been putting up
some tough competition.
After winning four times
in a span of five games from
March 26 through April 11, the
Bullets (5-7, 5-3 conference)
have suffered consecutive
losses to nationally ranked op
ponents Drew and William
Smith.
Through 11 games, se
nior Chrissy Nordoff is the
Bullets leading scorer with 34
goals and seven assists.
Nordoff leads the team in as
sists with sophmore Amy
Stambaugh, who has had 17
goals to go along with her seven

assists.
Freshman Michelle
Centrella has been the Bullets
starting goalie the whole sea
son and has saved close to 80
shots. Statistics prove these
women have had some tough
games. To date the Bullets have
scored 121 goals, while their
opponents have scored 122.
The Bullets have gotten off 336
shots while their oppoents have
only totalled 284 shots.
The team has registered
36 assists to their opponents'
25, and have also out- hustled
their opponents gaining 298
ground balls to their challeng
ers' 220.
In recent action, the Lady
Bullets took on the Lady Dip
lomats frnm F &" M. Once

again super-senior Kristin
Sullivan (17 goals, 3 assists) is
leading the team with her abil¬

ity and heart, as she endless
romps up and down the field.
The Bullets made a great
effort against the Diplomats
and played with all the inten
sity of a locomotive train, but
came up short in the end, los
ing 17-11.
The team has the talent
and they fight until the final
whistle blows, but the fact re
mains that this particular group
of women has only played to
gether for 12 games.
With mostly an under
classman starting contingent,
this squad, though packed with
talent, may just need one thing:
time. Though this season is
drawing to a close, along with
the carrers of Nordoff and
Sullivan, this group of Bullet
women hope to open eyes in
the future, with talent, heart
and experiences.

Junior Shanley Cooke looks to get a pass from one of her
teammates.

Women defend crown at Messiah, men compete well

by Erika Durst
Contributing Reporter
Strong performances
were recorded by the men's
and women's track and field
teams on Saturday at the Mes
siah Invitational. Although
both teams were set back due
to illness and schedule con
flicts, the women defended
their invitational title and the
men finished strong placing
sixth. The women's team bet
tered its record by sweeping the
18-team invitational. The Bul
lets finished with 117 points,
while Dickinson was second
with 111. Other strong teams
included Roberts Wesleyan,
Susquehanna, and Lebanon
Valley.

Leading the Gettysburg
women with individual efforts
was Tabitha Gary, whose per
sonal bests of 35-0 3/4 in the
triple jump and 16-2 1/2 in the
long jump earned her first place
in both events. Karen Helmick
lead the distance squad with a
personal record of 5:10.2,
good for 6th place, and a 5 th
place finish in the 3000m run.
Other personal bests in
clude Michelle Fields' 71.48
debut in the 400m hurdles, and
Kelley Lord's 43:50.98 effort
in the 10000m run.

The women's 400m relay
team of Keri Hymen, Jackie
Klug, Emily Brown, and Andi
Therit set a new school record
with a time of 51.01. Cathy
Spangler lead the women's field
events finishing seventh place
in the shot-put, a sixth in the
discus and fourth in the ham
mer throw.
The men's team, while
missing several key athletes,
posted many exemplary perfor
mances. Gene Kraus set a new
school record with his hammer
throw of 120-9, good enough
for a runner-up title. Nathan

Grim was the shot-put winner,
recording a new invitational
record at 51-5 1/4.
The men's distance team
was headed by Jon Catlett,
placing third in the steeple
chase (9:52.96) and eighth in
the 800m run (2:02.64), and
Dave Gary, completing 25 laps
in 34:15.58, for a third place
in thelOOOOm run, and record
ing a fourteenth place in the
800m Run. Will Hanema
achieved a personal best of 12
feet in the pole vault, while
running well in the 400m run
and 1600m Relay.

Muhlenberg. However, the
women were tripped up by the
Mules in the opener 6-5, be
fore earning the split with a 7
5 comeback victory in the sec
ond game. When the dust
cleared, they found themselves
in a familiar position, one
game behind Western Mary
land for the Centennial Con
ference lead.

In Lancaster, Melissa
Hazzard pitched 4 and 1/3 in
nings of shutout relief, while
scattering 3 hits to earn the 5-

4 victory over F &: M.
Emily Boardman singled
in the tying and what would
prove to be the winning run in
the 6th. Jill Murphy and
Marybeth Korejko once again
provided solid defensive play, in
addition to contributing multi
hit games.
In the twinbill finale,
Suzzanne Dailey was brilliant,
outdueling the Diplomats 2-0 in
a game, which did not feature
an extra base hit. Traci Bullock's
RBI single and Sara Gravehne's
sacrifice fly supplied the only of
fensive support.
The women were cruel
hosts to Albright on Thursday
outsconng them 21-5 in the
doubleheader. Graveline led
the balanced onslaught in the
first game, going three-for-three
with one RBI and two runs
scored.

Jody Noel scored three
runs, converting two walks into
stolen bases, while Sara Stokes
picked up the 11-3 win. In the
second game, Katelynn Gorton
tossed a three-hitter, allowing 0
earned runs en route to a con
vincing 10-2 triumph. Bullock
and Murphy each went 1 for 2,
driving in two and three RBI re¬

spectively.
Casey Stevens also con
tributed, going 2 for 2 and scor
ing three runs. Her efforts were
rewarded with a spot on the
Centennial Conference Honor
Roll. She batted .533 on the
week, going 8 for 15 with four
runs scored, three RBI, and two
stolen bases.
The Lady Bullets dropped
a disappointing, 6-5 decision to
Muhlenberg in the first game
on Saturday. Allowing three
unearned runs proved costly, as
they fell short in a seventh in
ning comeback. Stevens drove
in two runs on two for three
hitting in the losing effort.
Coach Mike Kirkpatrick was
not pleased with the result, but
he did not feel that his team was
overlooking the Mules. "I don't
(think we were looking ahead
to Western Maryland)," he ex
plained. "We just played a bad
game."

The women responded in
the nightcap to earn the split,
scoring three runs in the bot
tom of the 6th for a come-from
behind victory.
Karyn Miller's two RBI
double proved to be the differ
ence in the pivotal inning.
Third baseman Korejko and
shortstop Graveline repre
sented the left side of the infield
well, going three-for-three and
four-for-four, respectively. Sara
Stokes pitched six innings of
relief to pick up the win.
To this point, the Lady
Bullets have enjoyed one of
their most successful seasons in
school history, posting a 22-7
record. They conclude the sea-

The left side of the infield looks poised for action. Graveline and Adams are ready.

son this week with two tough
matchups. On Thursday, se
niors Traci Bullock, Marybeth
Korejko, and Jill Murphy play
their final home game against
nationally ranked Messiah.
Then, on Saturday, they travel
a half-hour south for the show¬

down in Westminster. "If we
can keep the game close and
limit their big, power hitters,"
said Kirkpatrick, "then we can
win it (the conference champi
onship). We're one of the top
teams in the conference."
