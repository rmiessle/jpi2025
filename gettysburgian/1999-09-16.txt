tinctions, from high- _^_MP_^
est to lowest, include Hk "- '

third in the nation for
"great food," eighth
for "homogenous stu
dent population,"
and twentieth for
"happy students."
These results are con
ducive to last year's
findings, and while
mixed, indicate that
Gettysburg is holding
steady as "cream-of
the-crop" institution.
Fifty-nine thou
sand students at the
country's best col
leges participated in
an exhaustive survey
to determine each
schools strengths and
weaknesses. The
Princeton Review,

which has published this guide since
1992, bases its finding solely on cam
pus feedback.
Other outstanding ratings for
Gettysburg fall under categories of
quality of life and academics, in which
we achieved 86th and 84th places, re
spectively. On these two areas, students
gave the Review an abundance of posi
tive commentary.
Regarding academics, one stu¬

dent explained, "When you have a prob
lem and you bring it to the attention of
administrators, they not only listen, they
do something about it." Those who par
ticipated in the survey attributed this to

Gettysburg College's ranking in the Princeton Review reflects its
standards of excellence.

the small student-teacher ratio (11 to 1).
Professors get an A for being "knowl
edgeable, caring, and enjoyable," and
"always have time to meet with you."
Undergrads at Gettysburg agree
that "academics are improving greatly."
The College has recently implemented
changes in the liberal arts core curricu
lum, broadening the distribution re
quirements in humanities, natural and
social sciences, mathematics, foreign lan¬

guage, writing skills, and non-Western
civilization. One student described the
academic standards as "rigorous but not
impossible."

ask visitors from other colleges...they
love our food!
Unfortunately, the Princeton Re
view 2000 guide shows that Gettysburg
is still made up of an extremely homo
geneous bunch of students. Writes one,
the "average student is wealthy, good
looking, somewhat athletic, friendly. A
lot of 'Jersey kids'." Another states, "the

This campus allows stu
dents who have the desire to
get involved many opportuni
ties to become active in cam
pus life. One -»«««_
of these op- _^^^^^^^H
portumties is _^^^^^^^

getting in
volved in the
Women's Cen
ter. This up
coming year,
the Women's
Center is lucky
to have senior,
Melissa Lam
and junior,
Megan Muoio
as co-directors
of the center.
Both
Lam and
Muoio are'ex
amplesof what
getting actively
involved in

Megan Muoio, Co-director of
Women's Center

campus life can be like. They
have also reaped the benefits of

such involvement in being
named co-directors ot the
Women's Center. Lam said that
she has been involved since the
beginning of Orientation
Sophomore year when she
transferred into Gettysburg.
Lam stated, " I've been associ¬

ated with the
Women's Center
through both be
ing a housesitter
and the Women's
Center associates
board".
Muoio also
stated that she
has been in
volved in the
Women's Center
since her first
year at
Gettysburg.
Muoio stated, "I
got involved dur
ing orientation
as well, through
being a
housesitter, sit
ting on the asso-

s
ciates board of the Women's
Center, and being on the

as well. Both Lam and Muoio
hope to work with other
groups on campus to further
knowledge of the issues that
face our campus. In the tenta
tive planning for next year is
the possibility of co- sponsor
ing a speaker with the Body-

Women's Conference planning
committee for two years".
Both Muoio and Lam
agree that they have certain
goals as co- directors for where
they would like to see the
Women's Center go in the next
year. The theme of this year's
Women's Center will be "I'm
Every Woman", with the idea
being that women can achieve
whatever they want if they
work at it. It is also a title that
promotes diversity among the
various options women would
like to choose for their future.
The idea of unity among
all women on campus also ap
plies to this key phrase. Both
Lam and Muoio want to see the
Women's Center be a place

Image-Task-Force and/or the
IFC. Both of these ideas are
something that both Muoio
and Lam want to look into to
boost awareness of campus is
sues to a larger crowd of
people.
Along with changing
people's perceptions of others,
the new co-directors hope to
foster an open environment in
the Women's Center by re
working the way in which the
learning lunches are run. The
learning lunches have always
been a great way to educate the
campus on a majority of issues,

where both Greek women and
non-affiliated women can inter
act together in ways that may
not be possible. The emphasis
is that the Women's Center will
be for all students, all faculty,
and all of the ad
ministration.

but both Muoio and Lam agree
that they would like to see
more of a dis¬

cussion for
mat in the
learning lunches. This
would pro
vide the op
portunity for
students and
faculty mem
bers to learn
what everyone

Computer Science, Math
departments expected to split

A different kind of drinking campaign

By Kristine Meier
Staff Writer
With the year 2000 ap
proaching rapidly, there has
been much emphasis on com
puters and technology. Here at
Gettysburg College, this has
always been the case and re
cently, there has been even
more emphasis.
The Computer Science
and Mathematics Departments
each have their own respective
majors and minors, budgets,
and faculties, but the one thing
that is lacking is the formal rec
ognition of the CS _department.
At the upcoming Board of
Trustees meeting, the CS de
partment is looking to be offi
cially considered as its own
department.

"I think the separation
would be a good thing because
both disciplines have grown to
the point that we can't be inte
grated anymore," said Dr. Rod
Tosten, Chair of the CS Depart
ment. Tosten, who himself is a
Gettysburg Alumni, was in the
first CS course taught at
Gettysburg and also received
the first Senior Award in the
Department.
He pointed out that the
department has had a minor
since 1987 and a major since
1985 and the discipline goes
back many years. The Com
puter Science discipline
stemmed from the Math de
partment, but its origins go
back even earlier.

Dr. Flesner was the first
professor to teach a course in
the area and is now the Chair
of the Math Department.
"Ultimitely in the long run, as
the Department of Computer
Science grew, it became fairly
obvious that it would lead to a
separation," said Flesner.
According to Dr. Carl
Leinbach, Computer Science
professor who is currently on
sabbatical, a committee headed
by Dr. Richard Mara was estab
lished as the visible presence of
Computer Science became
more visible on campus. This
was rightly called the Mara
Committee.

This committee then rec
ommended that an individual
CS group was formed. The col
lege, feeling that CS needed
more than that, formed the
Computer Studies group.
Members from areas including
Physics, Mathematics, Chemis
try and Management were in
the Studies group.
Eventually, the aiea had
its own budget and courses that
were listed in the College Cata
logue, but not its own faculty.
Other problems also arose be
cause, according to Leinbach,
"It is difficult for a person who
is trained in one area to make
an unbiased judgement of what
is being done in the other. And
Computer Science is not a sub
discipline of Mathematics, but
one in its own canon and stan-

NEWARK, Del. (TMS) —
Recent University of Delaware
graduate Greg Knott spent his
final semester protesting the
school's efforts to curb binge
drinking by drinking 1,000 beers.
Knott, who maintained
better than a 3.9 grade-point av
erage over the course of his four
years at the university, charted his
progress on his dorm room door
with a myriad of charts and
graphs. With help from friends,

dards of research and evalua
tion." Finally, the department,
because of student enrollment,
hired its own individual faculty
to teach several courses so that
professors from other areas did
not have to cross over disci
plines.
"Students keenly felt that
they were majoring in a sub
department and in a certain
sense lacked any departmental
identity," said Leinbach.
Because of the overflow,
Mr. William Leslie was first
hired as an adjunct of the de
partment and continues to
teach CS 103. Now, there are
15 members listed with the
Computer Science faculty. The
department, according to
Tosten, is currently looking at

he devised a plan to guarantee
his final count was accurate.
Rather than counting bottles and
cans, Knott counted ounces. A
full plastic cup — which can
hold a pint or more — was
downgraded to 12 ounces to
make the counting simple and
ensure Knott underestimated the
amount of alcohol he consumed
rather than overestimated it.
He reached his goal two
weeks before finals rolled
around in May and three weeks
ahead of schedule.
Knott said he spent about
$400 on beer — a drop in the
bucket compared to the
$750,000 given to the university
by the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation to support efforts to

hiring one more.
Although the department
needs approval by the faculty,
Board of Trustees and admin
istration, the situation looks
very hopeful. There is a meet
ing of the Board of Trustees
coming up in October.
"The timing is appropri
ate as we are planning for the
new science building and many
other additions," said Flesner.
After many years, the depart
ment has become very strong
academically and is looking to
wards expansion in the future.
"We are going to do won
derful things. I want to foster
programs with other disci
plines. Hold on tight because
a lot of good things are yet to
come," said Tosten.

stop alcohol abuse among stu
dents. While the university spent
money on alcohol-free events and
promotional posters, Knott hit lo
cal liquor stores to buy cheap
beer. Once in a while he said a
friend would donate a case to his
effort. Knott said he was always
careful to get his school work
done before he hunkered down
with a cold one — or 10 — for
the night. He said he consumed
an average of eight to 10 beers
each night throughout the five
months it took him to reach his
goal. What did Knott gain from
the experience? A great sense of
satisfaction and about 25 pounds,
he said.

While others contended
that "although a lot of people
look alike on the outside, there
is variety when you look
deeper," but even they concede
that students share most super
ficial traits. The school claims
it is working to boost diversity
on campus, but, according to
the survey, its efforts have thus
far failed to yield any substan-

tial results.
In other "bests," the U.S.
Air Force Academy ranked first
overall for academics, the most
beautiful campus went to Uni
versity of Richmond, and Sa
rah Lawrence scored the nic
est dorms. Florida State is the
top "party school," while
Brigham Young University gets
number one "stone cold sober
school." "Best professors at
teaching" went to Wells Col
lege, Pomona College was
voted "best run college," and
DePaul University got "stu¬

dents happiest overall." Finally,
the biggest fraternity and soror
ity scene went to Washington
and Lee University. Perhaps
next year Gettysburg will be
considered for that nomination*
On whole, Gettysburg
College ranked extremely well
amongst its 330 competitors,
and our campus can be proud
of its efforts to make this school
the finest institution it can be.
The food is great, the students
are content, and administration
is working diligently on issues
of diversity. Let's continue this
trend toward excellence.

ANGRY SALAD TO RILE JUNCTION
Band returns to Gettysburg to play BYOB party Saturday night

by Cara Masucci
Staff _Waiter
Are you looking for entertainment
this Saturday night? How about some
music you can dance to? If ypu an
swered yes to the above questions, you
should check out Angry Salad this Sat
urday night at midnight in the Junction.
The band, composed of lead
singer Bob Whelan_, drummer Hale
Pulisfer, bass Brian Vesco and guitarist
Alex Grossi, has been on the upswing
the past few years, and it promises to
be an unforgettable show on Saturday.
Starting out playing at fraternity par
ties and intimate clubs, the band is rel
ishing the attention they have been re
ceiving of late.
Angry Salad formed at Brown
University in 1993 and began touring
around the country. "What seemed to
make the most sense for us was to take
a page out of the playbook of great tour
ing bands we emulate who came before
us," said Bob Whelan, lead singer of the
band. Playing in small clubs up and
down the east coast since 1993 has al-

photo from www angrysalld com

lowed them to gain a following, much
like The Dave Matthews Band and
Phish. The live shows they give are
known across the country for their
"anything goes" feeling. "We're all
aware that people could be out doing
something else with their money and
we take that pretty seriously," said
drummer, Hale Pulisfer. "We put out
every single night so that no one looks
stupid - us or the people who recom
mended us to their friends."
This mentality has paid off tor
Angry Salad. They released their first
album called "The Guinea Pig EP" with
no label support. The group was then
nominated for the best debut album at
the Boston Music Awards in 1995, and
eventually led to their being signed with
Blackbird Recording Company. This
past spring the band released their ma
jor label debut with the self-titled al
bum "Angry Salad". The recording in
cluded a majority of songs that were
written by the band, including their first
single "The Milkshake Song." "The
Milkshake Song," along with others like

"Red Cloud" and "Sat
urday Girl," were in
spired by everyday
events in the guys'
lives. That's what
makes them so easy to
relate to. More than
thirty-five commercial
stations, as well as
many college stations,
are beginning to play
"The Milkshake
Song," famous for its
upbeat fun rhythm.
All of this suc
cess has made the band
very busy this fall.
"We've opened for
many different acts
this year," said
Whelan. "That is
great, since our musi
cal interests range
from Sarah
McLachlan to
Metalhca." In fact, the
name of the group is
inspired by the late
Freddy Mercury.

It just so happened that one night
while Whelan was in high school, he
was in a bar with his brother in the Vir
gin Islands thinking of a name for a band
the two Whelans were going to start.
All of a sudden a voice from the end of

the bar called out, Angry Salad. That
voice, says Whelan , was that of Mer
cury, the late lead singer of Queen.
Angry Salad was in Gettysburg
two years ago when they played with
Better than Ezra. "Pennsylvania was
very good to us," said Whelan. "We had
a great time and a great following at
schools like Penn State and Gettysburg
- we are looking forward to being back."
In fact, the band has some zany
antics planned for the show. "We like
to be a little crazy up on stage," said
Whelan. "Our tour manager just got this
$2 flute that he has been playing con
stantly - I think we'll pull him up on
stage to play a song."
The band credits their success to
the fact that they have great chemistry.
Says Whelan, "I could name so many
great bands from Boston who deserved
the ear of the country, but for whatever
reason, never toured. "Maybe they
didn't think they could do it. After all,
a lot of bands can't drive to a show 20
minutes away without breaking up.
We're fortunate that we happen to get
along real well."

The concert, sponsored by the
Student Activities Council, looks to be
a tremendous success. SAC has planned
the event to be BYOB. If you are look
ing to brighten up what looks like it will
be a rainy weekend, stop into the Junc
tion and check out the concert.

of Gettysburg College's Visual
Art Department, developed this
program. The goals of this ar
tistic exchange was to not only
bring an awareness towards the
art production presently occur
ring overseas, but to create an
opportunity in which a fasci
nating exchange of artistic
ideas can occur between two
vastly different college cam¬

puses. Warwick's motivation in
creating this exchange program
centers on his connection with
the Liverpool Community Col
lege and the various professors
there. Being a graduate of that
college, Warwick was able to
successfully contact and estab
lish the guidelines that put this
exhibition in progress. The
artists of Liverpool, Colin
Beckett, Peter Jones, and Geoff
Molyneux, were all enthusias
tic about the idea and felt it
would be a very lewardmg ex
perience.
The opening _teception of
"Cross Currents," which was
held on September 2, was a
great success. Visual Art Pro
fessor and future participant of
Gettysburg College's exhibi¬

tion in Liverpool, James Agard,
believed the night had a great
response. He stated that the
opening reception was "the
best opening in a long, long
time." Liverpool artist
Molyneux not only displayed
his work for the exhibition but
also gave several lectures to the
students and faculty of the Vi
sual Aits Depaitment. Accord
ing to Professoi Agard, these
lectui es were very beneficial for
his students. Molyneux ex
posed Gettysburg art students
to the modern European teach
ings and ideas of art. These stu
dents also established an under¬

standing of the environment
and atmosphere that exists
within an art classroom at
Liverpool Community College.
Piofessor Agard spoke of
vai ions differences between the
ait departments of Gettysburg
and Liverpool and concluded
that the department of
Liverpool was much more "ex
perimental." Liverpool stu
dents benefit from their urban
environment and the easy ac
cess to various art galleries
within the city. However,
Molyneux was quite favorable
of the Gettysburg art facility
and was impressed by the fi
nancial assistance the depart
ment is able to receive to main¬

tain its prestige.
Wally Brown, Principal of
the Liverpool Community Col
lege, says that "an exchange
such as this serves to highlight
those activities which often

pass unnoticed in the busy aca
demic year, that is, the pursuit
of professional practice of lec
turers each side of the Atlantic
within our respective institu
tions." Brown also comments, "I
am sure that the exchange of
ideas on professional and edu
cational issues can only
strengthen the work we do

here." Daniel R. DeNicola, Pro
vost of Gettysburg College,
comments "the title of both of
these exhibitions is Cross Cur
rents, alluding both to the
physical distance between the
two venues and to the flow of
thought, the successive ideas,
that are being considered in
different places around the
world."
The exhibition here at
Gettysburg will end on Octo
ber 3; however, this exchange
program will continue over
Thanksgiving break, when

Warwick, Agard, and Ander
son, as well as a number of
Gettysburg College administra
tors, will travel to Liverpool.
These three artists are currently
creating and maintaining their
pieces for shipping to England,
and their artwork will be put
on display at the gallery of
Liverpool Community College.
With this exchange the students
in Liverpool will learn much
from the art and lectures of our
Visual Arts professors and
Gettysburg College will be able
to establish its name among the
Liverpool art community.

Indian flutist performs debut on campus

Sikkil Mala Chandrasekhar ("Mala"), one of the finest South Indian artists of her generation,
made her American debut in Schmucker Recital Hall on Friday night. An award-winning
flutist, Mala projects in living sound the greatness of her ancient tradition through one of its
oldest conduits: the bamboo flute. In Hindu religious thought, whereby all the arts have
deep spiritual significance, the flute represents the call of God (as Lord Krishna) to return to
his divine love. Mala's concerts consistently meet with critical acclaim. Though now only her
in mid-30's she has been awarded the highest honorary title of her homeland: "Great Jewel

Brooks pokes fun at Hollywood
by writing about.. .himself?

by John Harii
Knight-Ridder/Tribune
Albert Brooks is a writer
in need of a muse.
At least he's in need of
one in his new comedy, The
Muse. He plays a frustrated
Hollywood screenwriter who
hires a pampered professional
muse (Sharon Stone) who is
rumored to be some kind of
goddess and who will presum
ably give him back hit. edge.
Did Brooks (Taxi Driver,
Mother) himself ever feel he'd
lost it? Does he shudder at the
thought of blank pages?
"No, I don't live in fear
of them," he said by phone
from Los Angeles. "But before
I begin writing I sort of know
it's going to be a mixture of tre
mendous highs and periods of
wanting to kill yourself."

This particular story was
written without Stone (Casino,
Basic Instinct) in mind, though
Brooks had no trouble casting
her or agreeing to use her star
power.
"They (the studio) gave
me a very short list of a dream
cast, and she was at the top of
it," he said. "I thought that was
lust sensational. People said she

hadn't done a comedy, but I
called her up, and she was re
ally cool, very trusting. She
wanted to do it without even
reading it. She'd been wanting
to do a comedy forever.
"When I asked her if she
was serious, there was this long
pause, then she said: "I'll be
your muse. I'll do it.'"
Brooks claims she con
tributed as much to the movie
as any actor he's worked with.
He welcomes the advice.
"I'd rather have someone
come to work every day with
11 ideas, and 10 of them stink
and one turns out to be great,
than have someone who says
nothing," he said. "She worked
at this. She just really dove into
this and took it very seriously.
I was impressed."
Stone even insisted on
adding a nude scene that
startles the Brooks character's
wife (Andie MacDowell).

"There's that brief mo
ment of nudity, but I didn't
write it like that," said Brooks.
"She was wearing a see-through
nightgown, and she thought it
would shock the wife more if
she were naked. Sharon isn't
looking to be naked; that's not
her goal every day when she
comes to work. But I did won¬

der, what other scenes can we
have you nude in?"
According to Webster's
New World Dictionary, a muse
is "any of the nine goddesses
who presided over literature
and the arts and sciences."
Brooks admits to having "mo
mentary muses" in his life.
"They don't last as long
as you wish, though my wife it.
still a muse, and my writing
partner, Monica (Johnson), has
felt muse-like," he said. "You
can fall in love for three weeks,
and only those three weeks,
and that person can be a muse."
The revelation of the
Stone character's true identity
seems just right, yet it does
come as a surprise.
"Thank God it does," he
said. "It's an Albert Brooks
movie. That's my contribution.
But I still have people say to
me, you didn't explain whether
she was a goddess or not.

"All I can do is present the
story. It's sort of cool if you (as
a moviegoer) take it to another
dimension and see something
else. In interviews I just say
she's a muse, but I never
thought she was a real muse.
That's not my particular be
lief."

The wager has been
made, the terms set. The bet is
clear: seduction and conquest.
The rules simple: 1) never fall
in love and 2) win at all costs.
So begins the movie Cruel
Intentions. This newest re
make of Dangerous Liaisons, is
chocked full of hip young stars
who don't disappoint. Starring
Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy
the Vampire Slayei, Simply Ir
resistible) Ryan Philhpe (54),
and Reese Witherspoon
(Pleasantville, Election) the

self to be just as much a con
spirator as Sebastian. Not to
mention being a drug addict
and a courtesan. If you rent
this film expecting a Buffy
esque character you will be dis
appointed.
Further, Sebastian and
Kathryn share an incredible
sexual tension, both implicit
and explicit. Watch your VCR
for signs of overheating. This
eroticism is so intense that this
viewer was wondering why it
didnt receive an NC-2 7 rating.
The crux of the plot is a
wager between Sebastian and
Kathryn. Kathryn bets
Sebastian that he cannot con-

film takes off into the world of,
at the risk of sounding trite,
sex, drugs and...more sex.
The world which the
main players inhabit is one of
posh comforts and boring lives,
set against the backdrop of the
New York socialite scene, in
stead of the 17th century
French court.
The main characters em
brace total indulgence to escape
their dull lives of prep schools,
luncheons and social obliga
tions for something more ex
citing. However, instead of
running from polite company,
Kathryn (Gellar) and Sebastian
(Philhpe) surround themselves
with it and, in Kathryn's words,
try to sleep with as many
people as possible.

quer (read: sleep with)
Anabelle (Witherspoon), a self
professed virgin who is deter
mined to stay that way. The
stakes are set high. If Sebastian
succeeds his greatest desire is
fulfilled, a romp in the sack
with Kathryn. If he fails in his
mission, Kathryn gets his 1954
Jaguar Roadster convertible.
The plot develops quickly
with many side stones all of
which are powered by witty
dialogue and the determination
of Kathryn and Sebastian to
win at all costs.
The only drawback to
this otherwise gleaming hand
book on psychological manipu
lation is the twist ending. So
as not to spoil the film, suffice
it to say that the dark charac
ters should be allowed to win
once in a while.

The characters are won
derfully fun. Philhpe plays the
sheik and slick Sebastian su
perbly. His swaggering attitude
and demeaning tones serve to
let anyone in earshot know that
he is in charge.
Fveryone, that is, except
Kathryn (Gellar). Sebastian's
half-sister, she appears to be an
ideal young woman confident,
strong _,md intelligent. In pri
vate, however, she reveals her-

This movie is quite enter
taining. Filled with scheming,
lust, and in many cases, humor,
one has to smile and wonder if
all of this plotting could ever
actually work out. A note of
caution, however: this is not a
date movie. It's not a good idea
to have your latest crush won
dering if you're harboring cruel
intentions.

Consider This

On the surface, Gettysburg might appear to be a college full o
many similar people. A cursory glance at the College population wil
reveal many athletic, white students wearing trendy clothes from J
Crew or The Gap. However, this is only the surface of the College
the most visible fraction of a student population diverse in many cat
egories.
This week's Focus section points out that while many student
are aware of their wealthy classmates, numerous other values are im
portant (some are from unprinted responses): friends, challenging aca

If you want to avoid the stereotyped im
age of a Gettysburg College student, don't complain about it, do some
thing! Each student has their own responsibility to get what they
want out of the college experience. Some people came here for aca
demics, others for social reasons. Despite what polls may reveal, Get
tysburg has just as much social diversity as it could need.

demies, the verdant greens of the campus, even
the CNAV computer system.
On this campus, the word homogeneity
is regarded as a dirty word. Most students
never take the time to truly examine the rami
fications of this atmosphere. This sameness
can lead to relaxation and ultimately the free
exchange of ideas and feelings. Just because
most students might appear similar outwardly
does not preclude the possibility that each has
something different and important to contrib
ute to the campus community.
Like any college, Gettysburg is as super
ficial as each person wants it to be. There are
more than enough opportunities on campus
for each person to do what he or she wants.
Numerous clubs and activities are available
year-round for those people that want to break
out of the college cliche.

If being part of the "in" crowd is your
thing, you won't have any problem fitting in
here. If you dare to be different however, it's
easy to find an outlet for your energy. Musical
groups, martial arts clubs, intramural sports,
service learning projects, academic interest
groups, G.E.C.O. and our very fine newspa
per and yearbook organizations are just the
tip of the social iceberg at this college.

Time has been going by faster and
faster lately. I didn't notice it at first,
but eventually 1 got wise to it. In the
beginning, we really didn't have much
to do, though now that school's been
going for some time, the hours just fly
right on by.
I thought about being
here, and how just last week
I was running through the
woods behind my elemen
tary school counting the
days until summer vaca
tion started. 1 loved
those days of com
plete freedom, and
wonder where

they've gone.
It is some
times disconcert
ing when you
think about all the
things you've
done - from those
hot afternoons I
eating ice cream
in the pool to the
coldest winter

days building crash test dummies out
of snow for the new sled - live on as
faint echoes from days long gone.
Thinking about it though, we're
in a perfect position to create newer,
happier memories. Every day is an op
portunity, each sunrise another chance
to brew some magic. Got to be careful,
though, not to just play out each day,
waiting until tomorrow to do anything.
The days fly by so fast that, if you don't
stop and enjoy them, you won't notice
they're there.
So stop and take that picnic in¬

stead of sitting around, counting the
minutes until the end of your last class
of the day. It may be the difference
between a fulfilled day and a wasted
one. On a more serious note, today's
soup was immaculate. If chicken rice
isn't the best in the world, I can't imag
ine what is. You'd be hard-pressed to
find another hot semi-meal on this earth
of ours that can hope to com
pare. This college does it some
justice. They mowed the grass
again, which really made my
week. Chicken rice and
mowed grass, such a good
combination.
Walking back
from another sorrow
ful beating in the

pool hall, I took a
good gander up at
the sky. The still
ness of the evening
gave way to a
simple breeze. Up
there, in the sky, a
thousand million
I eyes stare back at
only me; in the
same instant I
stood in unisofi

with a thousand million eyes staring into
the void of darkness at some other soul,
searching for solace in the vastness of
space. There I was, feeling smaller than
dust standing down here, but somehow
part of a wonderful and mysterious
waltz through the universe. Definitely
a moment that made me forget about
pool and everything else. Makes you
think that everything's got some bit of
purpose, some meaning. It's up to us
to figure out just what that purpose may
be.

this Side of Cynicism
Buckley's gets caught in the Web

7 [ 1

by la. isherwood
Social Commentator
Two years ago, my band,
the Warrior Poets, began play
ing at an Irish pub called
Buckley's on the other side of
town. Since that time, and up
until today, I have enjoyed
spending time at this bar and
restaurant and I am privileged
to call it my choice local haunt.
Yet recently, the family at
Buckley's (meaning the regu
lars and staff) learned that the
owners change
"look" of the tavern. In fact,
they mean to change the entire
theme of the place so many of
us call a second home. In a few
s, Buckley's
begin the process of remodel
ing which will continue until
spring, when the pub will be
transformed into a family res
taurant with designer coffee
and computers for easy internet

access.
Once again, we see a
quaint and homely establish
ment transformed by the grow¬

ing _desn es of a corporation into
a cold and stale money-making
machine. A machine that will
be built over the very founda
tion of the conversations, laughs
and songs which
have given the _^^^k

tavern so much
life and vi- I
brancy in the
past. V
When
I first _^ _»
learned of J_^^^
the "new ^^ _nfjv
look" I was \ J
, _^
and then
outraged,
and now I feel a
certain degree of
pity cannot understand
the meaning of a place

like Buckley's. For ^^^
many, it is just a bar, yet for
some of us, it is a place of peace
where reading and studying can
be done. I have read countless
stories and poems in the booths,
and the Warrior Poets have sung
countless numbers of songs

within the familiar walks.
The simple fact is that
Buckley's is one of the few bars
in this town where you can
have a meaningful conversa
tion, even at a whisper (ex
cept, of course, when we

are playing). It is a
place where history,
religion, family
lite, poll-

=

?_D

tics and great works of litera
ture have been discussed and
are almost as a matter of rou
tine. For many "regulars,"
Buckley's is a home away from
home, a place where you can

Hist telax and always find a
friend to talk to. Since I have
been going there it has gone
from a bar to a real community
center where children and
families talk to living-historians
about the Civil War. It is a
place where your family pho
tos are passed and where
people actually take the time to
ask "so how are you really do
mg ?" It is a place where
_^j Irish-American culture
_* ¦ can be expressed
I through the variety of
musical groups who play
N there. It truly fulfills
_Jk what the Irish lyrics rep
jiM iesent most, that "if
*jR you're Irish, come into
I the parlor." College stu
il I I dents, locals and tourists
JJJ all blend to raise a pint
and have a good time.

Now, I know this all
seems a little too ideal, and I
know that humans have a habit
of idealizing things which are
lost, but what I am trying to
convey is that the closing of
such a place would simply be a

loss to the whole community.
To our grandparents, the idea
of community was very impor
tant. In many cultures, the lo
cal tavern or bar was and is a
central meeting place where
people go to talk and catch up
with their neighbors.
Buckley's, as an Irish pub,
brings this environment, rare in
this day and age, to Gettysburg.
I suppose that is why the "re
modeling" or whatever they
call it is such a damned pity.
I know that many of you
have frequented Buckley's and

there are some of you who have
never been but want to go. And
that is the shame of it all - that
many will never see this quaint
little Irish theme bar from the
inside. The Warrior Poets will
be playing one of the last shows
from the quaint little pub we
call home on Friday night, so
stop in, have a pint (if you are
21 or over) and celebrate with
all of us the parting glass, cel
ebrate Finnegan's wake, and
celebrate the fact that no mat
ter what they take away, the
memories will last.

Town/Gown relations gone wrong

by Melynda McBeth
Contributing Writer
Picture the scene: two
girls-roommates, in fact-are
taking a walk around campus
on a Tuesday night. They don't
even see the two guys on the
porch across the street until
one of them yells "hello, la
dies!" "Hi!" one of the girls
yells back. The situation thus
far is not an uncommon one.
The conversation continues,
however, and the two girls end
up crossing the street and sit
ting on the porch. Connections
are made and introductions
completed. The girls realize
that the two boys aren't stu
dents at the college like they
originally thought them to be,
but are from town; they ex¬

change wary glances and the
plot, thickens. The decision is
made to stay and continue to
talk regardless. What is the big
stereotype about "townies",
anyway?
Now fast-forward a week
and a half. The two college girls
have become friends with the
two guys from town. It's a
Thursday night. The girls in
vite the guys over to hang out.
All is well. One of the guys an
nounces that he is going to At
lanta to live for a while but
won't say much else. The next
day he disappears, along with
two ATM cards, a credit card,
and $1,200 that he stole from
the girls the night before. What
makes matters worse is that he
told his friends what he had
done-even paid then each a
hundred dollars (the girls'

money, of course) to keep their
mouths shut. And they did.
Why are campus-town
relations so poor in Gettys
burg? Perhaps there are justi
fiable reasons for the tension
between students and resi
dents. I myself have 1,200 of
them. That doesn't mean that
all "townies" are thieves or bad
people, but I certainly will
never look at any of them
again without putting a protec
tive hand on my purse. The
police insist that another col
lege student could have com
mitted such a crime just as eas
ily, yet I disagree. A Gettys
burg College student may be
capable of taking money from
another student, but they
wouldn't have fled the state
after doing so. They would be
caught by now-while my little

thief is still a felon at large.
In an editorial published
last week in The Gettysburgian,
I. A. Isherwood stated that we
as students are viewed by lo
cals as "drunken, lawless
spoiled brats in some cases, or
indifferent and snobbish in oth
ers." Well, Mr. Isherwood, I
am no brat, nor am I snobbish
(I happily befriended several
"townies", did I not?), nor am
I lawless. Perhaps the
townsfolk should apply that fi
nal adjective to their own kind.
Do not feel embarrassed to say
that you are a Gettysburg Col
lege student. No, feel embar
rassed to say that you have de
fended the town after their re
cent actions.
To improve the relation
ship we as a college have with
the townspeople the student

body has established a commit
tee focused specifically on
town/campus relations. But is
there hope for significant im
provement? The town disap
proves of the parties that we
students have on the weekends,
among other things, and they
think us generally loud and dis
respectful. I as a student do not
feel safe in Gettysburg at night
thanks to the irresponsible ac
tions of some befriended
"townies," not to mention the
rash of robberies and assaults
that occurred last year near 7
11, and the more recent break
ins at Appleford Inn-a newly
converted dorm. I think
townies, well, scary. Is there a
solution to the problem, then?

Something new has support in New Hampshire has
emerged in American politics, increased by eight percent since
when you cannot win in your he hit the campaign trail. De
own political party, just switch spite efforts by the national
parties. Republicans, frustrated media to create a story where

_^_HV _^ by the
m increasing
_^^_p strength of
_^_V Texas Governor
_Y George W. Bush,
find themselves in a
quandary.
Talk of drug use by
the Governor as a young
man is not hurting the

there are no allegations over
drugs, Governor Bush has
failed to stumble, to the dismay
of many.
When Senator Bob Smith
of New Hampshire failed to re
ceive virtually any support even
in his own home state, he left
the GOP, declaring himself to
be part of the American Tax
Payer's Party. Did Senator
Smith ever think that the iea
son he was not generating any

support was that people did not Buchanan has increas
hke him? In 1996 he baiely mgly made his message one of
won reelection to the

United States Senate
from New Hampshire,
and most voters are just
not moved by this
unarticulated conserva
tive. Now, Pat Buchanan
is doing the same thing
except that he is looking
at the Reform Party. Pat
Buchanan's problem in
2000 is that voters have
heard his message twice
before and despite im
pressive showings in
1992 and 1996 he has

now worn .
Republican voters I
feel that his social conser- I
message con-
servative and in strong
economic times his protection
ist rhetoric does not sell as well.
Another reason for his lack ot
support in 2000 is that many
members of his organization
that helped him do well in Iowa
in the past and win New
Hampshire in 1996 have left
his camp. After two campaigns
with Pat many have moved
onto Steve Forbes or Gary
Bauer, hoping to give someone
else a chance to carry the con
servative mantle.
The Republican Party is
not less conservative this yeai;
it simply wants to win _aftei
eight years of Bill Clinton and
has turned its attention to new
candidates.
Pat Buchanan must _lovt

spoiling Bush family fun. In
1992 he badly hurt President
George Bush by challenging
him for the Republican Nomi
nation and now in 2000 he
could badly hurt the son,
George W, by taking away con
servative votes m a general elec
tion as the Reform nominee.
There is the potential for Gov
ernor Bush to be badly hurt by
Mr. Buchanan, but the Demo
crats are not out of the clear.

^^

MS-_^

economic nationalism, not cul
tural conservatism. Protection
ism seems to be the one issue
upon which Reform members
united, and to win their party's
nomination, Buchanan will
need to emphasis their issues.
Reform party members
are not cultural conservatives.
Their two most prominent fig
ures, the party's Piesidential
Nominee in 1996, H. Ross
Perot, and Minnesota Gover
nor Jesse Ventuia are both
moderates on social issues.
Governoi Ventuia is very mod
erate on social issues.
Running on economic na
tionalism and an America First
platform could convince many
Democratic union voters to go

Reform. Many Labor Demo
crats are disenfranchised by the
free trade policies of Bill
Clinton and Democratic candi
dates Al Gore and Bill Bradley
believe in free trade. These
voters may be most suitable to
a Buchanan candidacy.
If Pat i uns for the Reform
nomination there is no guaran
tee that he could win the
party's nomination, which
would leave him with no party.
Reform is now badly split be
tween Governoi" Ventura and
Mr. Perot, and Ventura,
the party's most popular
figure has expressed

doubts about Buchanan's
cultural conservatism.
The Governor has
been taunting the candi
dacy of businessman
Donald Trump and some
Perot backers are pushing
the two time presidential
candidate. Pat Buchanan
should do what Lamar
Alexander did, admit that
the Governor of Texas is
I too popular to defeat and
I if the support and organi
I zation is not there, he
I should step aside and let
I a Republican defeat Al
I Gore or Bill Bradley next

Certainly students will not stop
having parties. And more than
likely, robberies and break-ins
will continue as well. So how
can meetings between towns
people and students solve any
thing? Do they plan to give me
back $1,200?
The only solution I can
see is for us to compromise. If
they stay in town, I'll stay on
campus. Oh, and if my little
thief is out there reading this:
you owe my roommate and I
$1,200. Payable any time.

Woodstock '99: Despite high prices, the

member the thoughts I felt as

Compassionate conservatism is still

by Dan Ballentyne
CoNTRiBin ing Writer
Many conservative critics
have accused Texas Governor
George W. Bush of not being a
conservative, of being a mod
erate, or even being a liberal.
The accusations are completely
false. If you look at his record
and at the policy statements he
has made since the beginning,
his run for President shows that
he is a conservative and is just
trying to place a new face on
the conservative movement by
not allowing the Democrats
and their accomplices in the
mainstream press to smear and
distort himself and his message.
In actuality, all Governor Bush
is doing is repeating himself.
Conservatism is, and always
has been compassionate.

Let's look at Bush's
record as governor of Texas.
He restored local control to
schools. He passed the two
largest tax cuts in Texas history.
He abolished parole for violent
offenders and enforced the
death penalty more than any
other governor. He established
what are essentially reform
schools for disruptive students.
He required work for welfare
and brought faith-based msti-

worth of clothes, camping gear,
food, and the ever so necessat y
roll of toilet paper into my hik
ing bag, many images of what I
felt the first Woodstock was
like tumbled around in my
head. I envisioned long-haired
young men stimulating their
senses while having philosophi
cal discussions on everything
ranging from Freud to Nixon.
I also pictured smiling women
shedding their tops while sway-

conservatism tutions into the system as com
petition tor government. He
fought tor moie parental in
volvement prior to juvenile
abortions and helped promote
adoption. Is any part of this
un-conservative? No, of course
not. Now let's look at Gover
nor Bush's record since becom
ing a candidate for President.
He has stated that he supports
the Pro-Life Amendment to the
Constitution. He supports the
Religious Freedom Amend
ment to the Constitution. He
supports the Second Amend
ment. He is calling for tax cuts.
He wants to reform education
and give local areas more con
trol over their schools. He
wants to rebuild the military.
Again, there is nothing here but
conservatism.

The areas where Gover
nor Bush has received the most
criticism have been trade and
China. I will grant you that he
is a free-trader, supports the
Most-Favored Nation trade sta
tus, or as they call it now, Nor
mal Trade Relations, for China,
and supports Chinese member
ship in the World Trade Orga
nization. I will also grant you
thai Bill Clinton and Al Gore
hold the same opinions. Does
that make Bush a moderate?

ing to the music of Crosby,
Stills, and Nash. In this i evene,
everyone woie a layei of mud
and was under the influence of
some drug.
The annoying buzz of the
horn of my friend's Saab
brought me back to iealit_>.
Soon after we had loaded up
our Woodstock '99 bound car,
my friends and I were discuss
ing what we thought the thirti
eth anniversary of the first

Before you answer, let me te
mind you of one thing; the pro
tectionists (of which I am a
member) agree with House
Minority Leader Richard
Gephardt (D-Missoun). Does
that make us moderates? I
think not.
All the critics of Gover
nor Bush need to consider one
more thing before deciding not
to vote if he wins the nomina
tion. Governor Bush is a fai
sight better than Al Gore or Bill
Bradley. Do you want Al Gore
or Bill Bradley appointing three
Supreme Court justices and
halt the judiciary? I ceitamly
don't. We may very well have

the chance to bring God back
into our schools, to end affir
mative action, and many other
matters that the conservative
movement has wanted. And
we should be under no illusions
that Al Gore will appoint
judges that will rule in a con
servative fashion. We would
see the Second Amendment as
saulted, we'd see religion as
saulted even more, and we
would see our agenda set back
even further. That should not
be your goal. The goal should
be to advance the movement,
and not voting, paity jumping
and infighting only helps the
liberals.

Woodstock would be like.
Some ot us telt that we were
heading to a peace tilled cel
ebration, while others argued
that we weie on our way to
another concert planned by
materialistic promoters.
What we experienced in
the end was a cross between

that have now become related
to Woodstock '99 have been
"melee" and "chaos." The true
atmosphere of Woodstock '99
was one of peace and love,
what the original Woodstock
stood for and now what the
1999 Woodstock stands for to
me. Disappointment over the
increased fees at Woodstock
1999 notwithstanding, con
cert-goers generally had a
memorable time. The same
amiable atmosphere our gen
eration has seen on the docu
mentary of the first Woodstock
was still present at Woodstock
1999. Reason to forget every
thing and celebrate is one of the

our expectations. Aftei the con
ceit we all had ditfeient views
about the weekend. We agreed,
howevei, that like the original
Woodstock, Woodstock '99
was about tun and freedom. Al
though many things about this
Woodstock were different than
the first one, the essential at
mosphere was very similar to
that of the festival held in the
summer of 1969. Of course,
this Woodstock was well orga
nized, had many moie police,
cost exponentially more, and
had a much more diverse range

ot musicians performing. "
The tact that the promot
ers of the first Woodstock were
expecting only a fraction of the
concert-goers that had actually
anived to see the exceptional
venue ot musicians scheduled
to perform can account for the
difference in the marketing of
both Woodstocks. Intlationally
speaking, this year's $4 water
and $ 165 ticket prices were not
much lower in 1969. The ex
pected magnitude of
Woodstock '99 encouraged
planners and retailers to over
chaige and over-advertise the

. A small Iraction of the
1999 Woodstock crowd (an es
timated 100-500 people)
looted stands and started fires.
Consequently, the buzzwords

best piomoters of tolerance
and peace. For example, in seg
regated Alabama and Louisi
ana, blacks and whites were
brought together by the same
excuse for bad behavior at
Mardi Gras. Just as this south
ern tradition brought people
together for a week despite
their differences, so did the
third Woodstock. At
Woodstock 1999 concert-goers
from Canada had long conver
sations with their neighboring
American campers while Afri
can-American men and women
shared stories with their fellow
Caucasian Woodstockians. The
same "Woodstock or Bust"
signs could also be spotted
through the crowded parking
lots. Rome may have been a city
of mayhem for a weekend, but
it also was a place of peace
wheie people with different
skin color, musical taste, and
backgrounds all came together
foi the same reason—to party.

ing for Gettysburg's field
hockey team as they were
ranked sixth in the NCAA
coaches poll. Additionally, jun
ior Tabitha Gary was named the
Centennial Conference player
of the week.
Last Thursday the Lady
Bullets traveled to
Shippensburg to play in a non
conference contest. After scor
ing four goals in the first half,
there was little Shippensburg
could do to defend their pen
etrating attack.
Credited with putting the
ball in the cage before the half
time buzzer were senior Laura
DeSario, juniors Jenni White
and Gary. Gary scored two
goals.

Shortly after the start of
the second half, senior Steph
Fisher slammed a fifth goal in
for Gettysburg.

Junior goalie Maureen
Giese could not be credited
with a shut-out as Shippensburg
finally answered the long over
due call and also found the
boards for their first and only
goal of the game. Giese how
ever had five saves during the
contest for her second win oi

the season.
An equally talented de
fensive unit complements this
explosive attack. Junior
Megan Eddinger had a solid
game in the backfield, stopping

Shippensbuig's attack and dis
tributing the ball to a Gettys
bmg stick.
_Aftei this commanding
win, the held hockey team
hosted the Swarthmore Garnet
Tide in their first conference
game of the season on Satur
day. DeSario was the first to
hnd the goal for Gettysburg
late in the first half. By the half,
the score remained 1 -0, Gettys
burg. Swarthmore tied the
game early in the second half,
but a turn of events quickly
occurred as the Bullets once
again took charge of the con
test. Less than two minutes
later, Fisher scored the game
winner off of an assist from
DeSario.

Later in the second half
Fisher again found the cage to
seal off the win, while shortly

aftei Gary closed scoring for
the day.
The attack was fueled by
the speed of senior Amy
Stambaugh and a relentless de
fensive unit.
This victory puts Gettys
burg at 3-0 overall and 1-0 in
the conference. This week the
Bullets travel to Haverford on
Wednesday in a conference
challenge. Saturday they travel
to Catholic in non-league ac
tion. Looking ahead, the Bul
lets will face rival Messiah at
home on Tuesday. Fan support
would be greatly appreciated.
Additionally, Thursday
September 23 is being cel
ebrated as faculty appreciation
day and all Gettysburg College
administrators and faculty are
urged to attend the women's
game versus Muhlenberg to
support their student-athletes
outside of the classroom.

a respectable 81. Of the other
starters, first-year Chris
Redfern, who played in the
number one spot, fired an 84,
and first-year Mike Longley
and senior Rick Deutsch never
quite got it going. Both carded
86's. Other scores turned in

The men's golf team
opened their season with a tol
erable, but otherwise unimpres
sive showing in the annual Get
tysburg Fall Invitational on
Monday.
The Bullets placed tenth
in a field of sixteen teams with
a score of 337, a considerable
35 strokes off Muhlenberg's
score of 302. The greatest fac
tor in the team's disappoint
ment was that the tournament
was held at their home course,
Gettysburg Country Club.
They had hoped to have a size
able advantage.
However, with three of
Gettysburg's five starters being
first-year players, many of the
players from other schools
could have conceivably had
more course knowledge than
the young Bullet team.

The relatively young
team was the main point of
consolation for Head Coach
Casey Counseller on an othei
wise disappointing day.

conditions with high winds at

bloated scorecards.
They will have a week to
fine tune their games before
next week's Susquehanna Invi
tational at Edgewood in the
Pines. The Gettysburg Women's
Golf Team competed in the
tournament as well, making it
their * first competitive match in
school history. They came in
with a bang, carding a two per
son total of 218. The combi
nation of Christine Champey's
108 and Kelley Brennan's 110
beat all three other women's
teams which competed.
Champey, who has recently
started the women's golf pro
gram, is thrilled not only to
have generated the interest in
golf, but to have won their first
ever tournament.

"To be doing so well in
our first tournament is great,
but we expect even more
people to be trying out for the
spring season," she said. "It's
really exciting to be pioneering
this whole thing."
They look to continue
their success next Wednesday
when they travel to Dickinson
College.

At the Lebanon Valley

weekend, junior Jonathan
Catlett's second-place finish led
a strong Gettysburg contingent
as the men's cross country team
finished second at the 25 team

was bettered only by Goucher
College's Jeff Olenick, . who
broke the tape at 26:40.45.
Gettysburg's next finisher
was junior Jason Rose, who fin
ished sixth overall with a time
of 27:07.92, dropping his per
sonal best by more than a
minute in the process.
It was this effort which
earned Rose the Golden Cleat
award for the race, as well as
high praise from head Coach
Robert Condon.
"This was a breakout per
formance for Jason," said
Condon. "We expect him to
only get better."

Freshman Dan Campion
continued to improve, finish

place overall.
Rounding out the top
seven for Gettysburg were
sophomores Evan Merkhofer

Senior David Gary man

on the back of his leg suffered
on the day before the race.
In summing up the men's
performance Condon cited the
usual littany of injuries and ill
ness, but he felt that Rose and
Campion's efforts were posi
tive signs for a team poised to
be successful in the region.
Catlett echoed his coach's
sentiments. "The races that

Rose and Campion ran showed
a team with promise. If we can
fill the gaps that we have, we
should surpass even our own
expectations," he said.

The Golden Cleat on the
women's side went to sopho
more Annalisa Debacco, whose
time of 23:34.34 was a per
sonal best by over three min

ment. According to Davis,
Debacco's effort was the
epitome of the Bullets philoso

common goals," she said. "We
look to improve every time we

Bullets win Battlefield Classic

from Staff Reports

Gettysburg played and
swept five matches, including
a 3-0 win over Lycoming in the
championship, to capture the
1999 Battlefield Classic on Sat
urday.
In pool play Friday, the
women downed Seton Hill 3-0
(15-3, 15-13, 15-5) and then
swept Scranton 15-6,16-3,15

sweep Richard Stockton (15-9,
15-9,15-7) and Johns Hopkins
(15-5, 15-12, 15-10) to reach
the finals.
In the finals, Gettysburg
finished its perfect weekend
with a 15-11, 15-13, 15-8 win
over Lycoming.
Senior Catherine Schott
and junior Nicole Evans were
the two Bullets named to the
12-player all-tournament team.

" We played really well as
a team," said Evans. "We don't
have a lot of big guns, so we
need to play together."
Schott was named the
AVCA/Sports Import Division
III National Player of the Week
for her efforts. It is the second
time she has earned the presti
gious honor in her collegiate
career.

This weekend, the
women's soccer team hosted
the Gettysburg Classic tourna
ment. Three teams attended:
Skidmore, Richard Stockton,
and Oneonta. Friday afternoon
the Bullets faced Skidmore in
their home opener.
Gettysburg posted its first
win of the season, defeating
Skidmore 2-1.
Although the Bullets
dominated, the first half of the
game remained scoreless.
Skidmore was first to score, but
Gettysburg quickly answered
with a goal by senior captain
Maureen McBnen, assisted by
Maureen O'Donnell.

Not long after McBrien's
score, junior Rachael
Rzemieniewski put the Bullets
ahead of Skidmore. Assisted by
Amy Brewter, Rzemieniewski
scored on a semi-breakaway
from the outside.
Rzemieniewski's goal proved to
be the game winner, as the Lady
Bullet defense held Skidmore
scoreless.
Head coach Todd
Wawrousek was pleased with
the team's victory on Friday,
especially after a disappointing
start to the season. He said he
is happy to see the team im
proving.

Gettysburg's improve
ment was evident again on Sat
urday, as the Bullets took on
rival Richard Stockton. Al
though the Bullets lost 1-0,
Wawrousek called this match

Women's soccer team hopeful following tournament

his teams best game yet, with
each person playing extremely
well. Captain McBnen feels
that the game was a positive

sign for the team. "Although it
was really frustiatmg, it we
continue to play that well, there
will be no turning back this sea
son,' she said.
_Gettysburg dominated

the game, outshooting Richard
Stockton 7-6. The score was
tied at 0-0 until the sixty-fifth
minute. After a left side cross,
a Stockton player struck from
the 25 with a shot goal keeper

_Fnii Hay den couldn't stop.
Because of a solid defense
led by sophomoie Kayleen
McLaughlm, who played 2 ex
cellent games this weekend, the
Bullets held Stockton to 1 goal.

"It was a monumental
task to hold Stockton at bay to
6 shots," said Wawrousek.
He sees potential for

Girman, and Hayden, whose 5

saves contnbuted to the defen
sive success.
However, Gettysburg's
offense is not quite as victori
ous. "We have a good mix of
forwards, but not enough op
portunities," Wawrousek said
concerning the team's inability
to score.
Lauren Scott, Whitney
Jackson, McBnen,
McLaughlin, Rzemieniewski all
contributed shots, but unfortu
nately couldn't stick them in
the back of the net.
Wawrousek felt the Bul
lets deserved to win the game
against Stockton, as they played
the better all around game. He
hopes to see a change in the
offensive action as key players
Whitney Jackson and Amy
Brewster overcome injuries.

Wednesday the Bullets
host " dangerous" Franklin and
Marshall to begin the Centen
nial Conference season. The
team's main goal is to defeat 2
2 F & M and focus on the rest
of the conference games.
Winning the conference
would make Gettysburg elgible
for the NCAA tournament.
The Lady Bullets travel to
Elmira on Saturday before
hosting a tough Ehzabethtown
team on Tuesday. They will
look to improve on their 1-4
record.
"We learned hard lessons
early on...a good prep for the
Conference," said Wawrousek.

Men's soccer left with empty feeling after tying rival

by Robin Roger
Staff Writer
On Tuesday, the men's
soccer team played to a 1-1 tie
versus Messiah, bringing the
Bullets' record to 3-1-1. The
nail biter ended in two fifteen
minute overtime halves and
showed the two teams to be
evenly matched.
Although the Bullets had
many opportunities, they failed
to capitalize. Except for a 35th
minute goal by sophomore
Clayton Krum, assisted by se
nior Jason Vishio, the Bullets
could not find the back of the
net. Krum had many scoring
opportunities, but made good

on a ball from Vishio. The se
nior captain slotted the ball
through the defense and Krum
pinged it home.
"He just put it out there,
and I tried my hardest to make
it there in time and put it
away," said Krum. Krum also
called attention to the rivalry
between Gettysburg and Mes
siah. Gettysburg had not
scored against Messiah since
1996, and lost a tough regional
game last season at the Falcon's
field. Once Gettysburg was up,
Messiah came back hard to
avenge the goal, but keeper
Nicholas La Porta posed a for
midable challenge.
The junior goalkeeper
played a tight game with few

mistakes. He only allowed one
ball through in the 86th
minute, sent by Messiah's Jake
Sauer. La Porta was a bit nervous
because it was the first time he
had ever faced Messiah. He felt
the Bullets dominated the hist
half, but were undei a lot of
pressure during the two over
time halves.
Never was the pressure
greater than during the over
time period when the Falcon's
outshot the Bullets 9-1. He
posted 11 saves ovet all and was
a star player in the match.
It was an aggressive game
with 59 fouls and six yellow
cards. A handball in the box
gave the Bullets an outstanding
chance to score, but the Mes¬

siah keeper tipped senior Chi is
Pi yoi 's ball off the goal post for
a narrow miss.
"Although they played
well, we didn't play to our po
tential," said LaPorta. "We're
playing well, but we're still
waiting for a tew things to
click." This tie does not commu
nicate the message Gettysburg
would like to send to other
teams. La Porta said, "Tying
was a defeat rather than a vic
toi\. " Vishio said the men had
an aveiage game skill-wise, but
played with a lot of heart.
"Fven though we tied a good
team, we were disappointed
with the outcome," he com
mented.

This game adds one to
the tie column, with only one
loss to Gettysburg's credit.
On September 8th, Get
tysburg trounced Susquehanna
6-0 for an easy win.
Pryor, freshman James
Bealer, junior Wes Thurmond,
senior Jesse Flynn, Vishio, and
Krum all posted goals. The
Bullets outshot their opponents
26-4. The Bullets also beat
Eastern 2-1, on September 11,
with goals by Flynn and junior
Jeremy Shapiro. The Bullets'
only loss of the season was to
Shippensburg, a Division II
school.
Their next game, which
will open conference play, is on
Saturday at Washington Col
lege.

Football falls to Hampden-Sydney
Paul Smith sets school rushing record, as Bullets drop to 0-2

by Bill Davidson
Sports Editor
On Saturday, senior Paul Smith
secured his place in Gettysburg history
and the Bullets made big strides as a
team. But it was not enough as Gettys
burg lost to Hampden-Sydney 28-14,
to fall to 0-2 on the season.
Hampden-Sydney's Ernest
Cheatham ran for 158 yards on 17 car
ries and Walt Bondurant threw for 225
yards and one touchdown to lead the
Tigers.
On a day in which Smith set the
rushing mark, it was Gettysburg's pass
ing game which keyed their attack. Jun
ior Dennis Flaherty completed 17 of 32
passes for 181 yards and one touch
down.
Junior Jeff Boyd was Flaherty's
favorite target. The duo connected
eight times, a career high for Boyd, who
also scored the game's final touchdown
on an 11-yard reverse.

Boyd was named to the Centen
nial Conference Weekly Honor Roll for
his efforts.
Hampden-Sydney scored the
game's first touchdown less than three
minutes into the contest. The Tigers
shredded the Bullet defense, marching
80 yards in just seven plays.
But Gettysburg's defense settled in

Senior Paul Smith became Gettysburg's all-time leading rusher Saturday,
surpassing Dwayne Marcus from the class of '94.

Hampden-Sydney took the lead for
good, following a 72 yard drive, sus
tained by a 34 yard gain on a fake punt.
Hampden-Sydney extended its
lead to 21-7 with a seven-play, 93-yard
drive, their first of the second half.
Sophomore linebacker Ryan
Moore led a much improved defensive
effort, with a game-high 19 tackles, in
cluding seven solo. Senior Chris
Lunardi made 14 tackles while sopho
more Tim Krzeminski was in on 12
stops. Moore received acclamation for
his performance, being named to the
Centennial Conference Weekly Honor
Roll. Smith, who rushed for a career
high 277 yards against Hampden
Sydney last year, finished with "only"
59 yards on 19 carries. It was enough,
however, to make him Gettysburg's all
time leading rusher, surpassing Dwayne
Marcus (Class of '94). Smith finished
the day with 3,872 career rushing yards.
Smith reached the record on his
17th carry of the contest, a gritty nine
yard gain.

Hampden-Sydney outgained the
Bullets, 542 to 298, in total yards on
the game while holding the ball for an
even 35 minutes.
Junior offensive lineman, John
Bianchi has spent his career blocking for
the star running back. "He deserves it
(the record)," said Bianchi. "He trains
harder than anyone I've ever seen."
"It's an honor to be a part of it,"
he continued. "He's the best football
player I've ever played with."
The Bullets schedule does not get
any easier. On Saturday they host sev
enth ranked Western Maryland in their
Centennial Conference opener.
Despite the odds, Gettysburg is a
confident underdog. "If everyone does
their job, we should fair well," said
Bianchi.

after that.
Gettysburg was forced to punt on
their first possesion, but a fortuitous
deflection recovered by freshman Cliff
Mason on the Hampden-Sydney 29 set
up the Bullets' first score.
Midway through the first quarter,
Gettysburg tied the score at seven apiece
as Flaherty hooked up with sophomore
Alex Nicholas for a 16-yard touchdown
reception.
