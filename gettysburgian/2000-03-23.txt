tions weic addiessed bv all paitiupat
mg parties, the floor was opened to
questions horn the audience, which
was composed mainly of Adams
County community members.
Candidates offered a broad scope
of solutions to current problems fac
ing the United States, including such
dilemmas as preservation of the fam
ily faun, improvement of public
schools, pi evention of violence within
the school system, the need for tax cuts

Candidates forum highlights hot
topics in Congressional primaries

Six competitors for election to
Congress took part in a candidates fo
rum of the nineteenth congressional
district Tuesday night in the Ballroom.
The program, sponsored by the
Gettysburg Chapter of the American
Association of University Women, fo
cused on the diverse array of issues

pertinent to
voters in the
upcoming Con
gressional pri
mary in Penn
sylvania on
April 4.
The de
bate featured
Re publican
candidates Dick
Stewart, Todd
Platts, Albert
Maslaand, and
Charles Gerow,
and Democratic
candidates Jef
frey Sanders
and John
Moran.
Political
science profes
sor Dr. Kenneth

Mott served as the event's modera
tor, and a student panel posed a set
of prepared questions to the partici
pants. Ted Hartman and John Dunlap,
both senior political science majors at
Gettysburg College, presented ques
tions to the candidates. Each partici
pant was allotted one minute to re
spond to the questions. Doug Walo
filled the role of timekeeper through
out the proceedings.
The questions ranged from spe
cific concerns within the nineteenth
congressional district to issues of na
tional significance. The nineteenth
district includes Adams, Cumberland,
and York Counties. After these ques-

and the betterment of basic health care, tions.
The participants also addressed the Hartman speculates that "Sand

classic controversial issues of abortion,
homosexuality in the military, and cam
paign funding.
Many questions provoked wide
spread agreement across party lines,
but several others caused dissent from
within one or both parties.
One notion that sparked contro
versy among the candidates involved
use of school vouchers. Hartman com
mented on Todd Plans' stance, claim
ing "Platts was too liberal on vouchers
for a GOP candidate, and vouchers are
the bread and butter of Republicans'
educarional reform."
Another hot spot in the debate

centered on sky-iocketing oil prices
and how to halt their rapid inflation.
Dick Stewart emphasized the
need to tap into our own oil resources
in Alaska and the Pacific, while Moran
argued the importance of preserving
these reserves as strategic supplies.
The problem of violence in
schools unleashed a wide spectrum of
proposed solutions encompassing bet
ter enforcement of gun control laws
currently in existencethe develop
______^^_ ment of a

gun
with improved
safety features,
and federal gun
buy-back pro
grams.
The topic
of "Roe v.
Wade" caused
the most turmoil
during the de
bate. Republi
cans stood on
the pro-life ten
ant of their party
platform, and
Democrats tip
toed into risky
territory by
broaching the le
galization of par
tial birth abor-

ers' support of partial birth abortions
is far too liberal for the conservative
constituency of Pennsylvania."
"I was impressed with all the can
didates," stated Dunlap on the over
all success of the forum. He added,
"I felt overall that Al Maslaand seems
best suited to be a U.S. Congressman."
Hartman said that he was also
"impressed with the caliber of the can
didates, particularly Sanders,
Maslaand, and Stewart. Dick Stew
ard did the best job of articulating con
servative principals, while Al
Maslaand wisely catered to constitu
ent concerns."

College modifies alcohol
policy for Springfest

By _Krisiini. Mi ilk
StaitWritlr

When Springfest occur;
on April 29, students will wit
ness more than the band
"Strangefolk". They will alsc
see a change in the College'_s
alcohol policy.
There is currently ,_i
BYOB alcohol policy for so
cial events on campus. This
strategy will be replaced by a
hosting policy.
At the Student Senate
meeting on March 20, Mark
Sikes and Tom Mottola dis
cussed with students the
changes that will debut at
Springfest. Several adminis
trators, as well as APRAB

have been discussing the new
policy that they feel will be a
good one for the campus so
cial events.
Students age 21 and ovei
will be allowed a two drink
limit each. The beer provided
will be purchased from a dis
tributor in New York. Only
one brand of beer will be
served. Sikes and Mottola
mentioned that they would
look into the possibility of
purchasing and offering other
choices with the distributor.
The college did apply for
a liquor license for the event,
nut was denied. Alcohol,
rherefore, will not be sold at
springfest. Mottola and Sikes
feel that with the alcohol
limit, responsible drinking
ivill be promoted through the

new hosting pohev. 1 he new
policy will also make
Spimgfest moie of a lea
world envnonment
Sikes, Mottola aiu
APRAB anticipate a positive
reaction from the sfudeni
body. The policy is designec
to promote an increase in stu
dent participation in College
social events while _promoting
the responsible use of alcohol,
What are students' eai I) 1
reactions? "I think that mov
ing from a BYOB policy to a
hosting policy is _something
that the students will like,''
said Olivia Campbell, Student
Senate Secretary, '02.
Alcohol policy revision
is still being reviewed by ad
ministrators, and this policy ii
not final.

Head of the Coffeehouse
Committee
This Saturday the coffee
house will again present some of
the top acoustic talent in the coun
try for your listening pleasures.
This week Christopher Williams,
whom according to the Boston
Globe "writes literate tunes of the
heart and the road with rhythmic
drive and honesty...," will grace

Coffeehouse promises talent-laden
entertainment

the stage of the Junction starting
at 10 pm.
This will prove to be a great
show, because not only is Chris
topher Williams a great singer/
songwriter, but his younger
brother Matt is a first-year student
at Gettysburg. The acoustic duo
of seniors Samantha Gregg and
Ian Isherwood will open the show.
As always, free food and coffee
will be provided and the open mic
will follow the performance.

Christopher Williams is
quickly making a name for him
self on the national singer/
songwriter scene today. From
non-stop national touring for four
years as a solo artist, to playing
djembe/percussion with other
songwriters, most notably David
Wilcox, Peter Himmelman, and
Ellis Paul, to independently releas
ing and selling over 7500 of his
three recordings, to repeatedly
selling out two show nights at the
famed Club Passim in now
homebase, Cambridge, MA, Wil
liams continues to only move for
ward with critical acclaim his
short career.
The first month of this new
millennium is one indication of
Williams' continued momentum,
and it hints at the fact that 2000
may be his best year yet. In late

January, on the last day of mixing
his third solo recording, the silence
in between, Williams received a call
that he had been nominated for his
first Boston Music Award.
This recording features per
f o r -

mances by
drummer
Jerry
Marotta (Indigo
Girls, Pe
t e r
Gabriel),
fretless bass
player
Michael Manring

(Michael
Hedges,
J ohn
Gorka),
and spe
cial guest
David Hidalgo
from Los
Lobos. A
couple of
days later,
upon his
return to

Christopher Williams' solo album One Man Service Station, was chosen
as one of the Top Twelve Independent releases of the year in 1997.

Boston with his new recording in
hand, he was invited to play per
cussion on David Wilcox's new re
cording in early March.
Set for an early April release,
the silence in between has raised
the bar on Williams' last solo re
lease, One Man Service Station,
that was hailed by the Boston
Globe and chosen as one of the
Top Twelve Independent releases
of the year (1997) by Performing
Songwriter magazine.
the silence m between not
only features an all star lineup of
musicians, but also new songs that
captivate the listener with melodies

ready for radio. Honest and acces
sible, these songs, as one reviewer
writes, "offer a sound that is
strong, vital and reflective of the
heart and soul of
Americana...these are songs that

people can i elate to; that they have
lived; that they understand and
find comfort in hearing" (indie
songwriter magazine).
Williams was a winner of the
Wildflower Festival Songwriting
competition in Texas (1999), as
well as a finalist in both the KRCL
Songwriting competition in Salt
Lake City (1998) and South
Florida Folk Festival Songwriting
competition (i 997). He has shared
the stage with such artists as Patty
Larkin, Dongie MacLean, Chris
Smither, Livingston Taylor, and
Cheryl Wheeler. He has per
formed at venues ranging from

The Tin Angel (Philadelphia) to
Gengis Cohen (Los Angeles), The
Stamford Performing Arts Center
(CT) to the Caravan of Dreams
(Ft.Worth); as well as such festi
vals as Falcon Ridge (Hillsdale,
NY), Rocky Mountain
, , Folks (Lyons, CO) and
v : _H Kerrville Folk Fest (TX).
'¦**¦_' A New York state na
' *•>/, tive, Williams moved to
' f t ' Boston in late 1996, after
_5>,A spending four years in Se
>_r "" attle. There, armed with
,.'*_. "„'; only a degree in Religious
Studies and the experi
ence of starting his own
"\ coffeehouse at his alma
mater, Bucknell Univer
.* i - __ sity, he left his job as a pre
school teacher to claim his
passion.

Honing his skills as
an engaging writer and
performer and drawing
audiences in with his in
tricate and rhythmic self
taught guitar style and
smooth baritone voice,
Williams continues to de
liver performances full of
conviction and songs that
are rich with detail, hope
and fearless honesty.
Whether solo, or as one third

of the new performing songwriter
collaborative trio, The Bixby's, or
as sideman for many acoustic art
ists, you can be sure Williams will
remain an active and strong pres
ence on the national acoustic
scene. As one reviewer/critic sug
gests, "one of the best parts of the
Falcon Ridge Festival was the
ubiquitous Christopher
Williams...you couldn't go any
where without seeing him." Re
member his name and keep your
eyes open...

The quartet has been performing

"Siegfried Idyll," Dmitri
Shostakovich's "String Quartet

"String Quartet No. 2." Wagner's
piece, completed in 1870, derives
parts of its melody from an old
German cradle song; he wrote it
for his son, Siegfried. The tran

Book Reviewer
Frank McCourt. '—Tis:
A Memoir. New York:
Scribner, 1999. 367 pp.
I was so moved by Frank
McCourt's first memoir, the
Pulitzer Prize- winning
Angela's Ashes, that I jumped
at the chance to read his se
quel, '—Tis.
'—Tis picks up almost
precisely where Angela's Ashes
left off—with twenty year-old
Frank sailing from Ireland to
America, dreaming of a land he

had not seen since he was a
little boy. It is a dream, as he
and we soon find out, that is
in stark contrast with reality.
McCourt knows no one
in New York City, save for a
priest he met on his voyage,
and he is forced out into a
strange world with only a lim
ited education, an Irish accent,
and himself. McCourt, how
ever, has been through worse
and the result is that'—Tis be
comes not just a story of
struggle, but a powerful tale of
his road to success.

The reader travels
with Frank as he establishes
and educates himself, some
times in the classroom,

sometimes beside fellow
soldiers during the Korean
war, or in the bars late at
night in New York, or even
with the birth of his only
child. McCourt's child
hood in Ireland, his rela
tionship to his family, and

his father's failings, and their
influence seeping into his.
adulthood are echoed
throughout the book.
With the same power as
Angela's Ashes, '—Tis enter
tains the reader with humor,
heartache, and an almost
embarrassing honesty that
seems to be McCourt's signa
ture. He isn't afraid to say it
like it is and that is perhaps
one of the most alluring fea
tures of'—Tis.
McCourt's directness is
present not only on his nar
rative, but stylistically.'—Tis,
like Angela's Ashes, is written
with a simplistic elegance
that allows McCourt's voice
and personality to come alive
rather than be buried in rigid
formality.

Even if you haven't
read Angela's Ashes, '—Tis
tells a story all its own, so
don't be afraid to pick it up
first. You might miss out on
some of the finer details, but
McCourt has a captivating
voice and a great story to tell.
This is definitely one sequel
which lives up to the reputa
tion of its predecessor.

Every once in a while,
a new restaurant opens in
our beloved Gettysburg.
When Paddy O'Rorke's
Irish Tavern opened on the
16th of this month, I, your
humble servant, took it
upon myself to evaluate this
new culinary experience.
Once again, I sacrificed my
waistline for you, the
Gettysburgian readers.
Located on Steinwehr
Ave., O'Rorke's provides
patrons with a relaxed pub
atmosphere. Being a full
service bar as well as offer
ing an ample variety of pub
food and more substantial
entrees, O'Rorke's offers a
customer with a panoply of
dining and beverage op
tions.

New pub a pleasure to
diners
Virgil Kane's Culinary Corner

There is a wide variety
of appetizers, salads, and
baskets from which to
choose. In addition, there
are both cold and hot sand
wich options with a variety
of breads and toppings to
make your sandwich your
own way. You can also cre
ate your own hamburger,
turkey burger, or chicken
breast sandwich from tradi
tional toppings like Ameri
can cheese or the less tradi¬

tional salsa and guacamole.
There are 16 entrees,
from beef to seafood to tra
ditional Irish favorites like
the Guinness beef stew.
Due to the large variety, the
average price per meal
would vary greatly, but the
portions are large and all
prices are extremely reason
able. Whether you seek a
light lunch with a pint or a
full sit-down meal,
O'Rorke's provides a solu¬

tion. O'Rorke's has spared
no expense m creating the
perfect atmosphere for an
Irish tavern ._nul _e.iterv. As

you walk in the door you
are greeted by warm
smiles and then seated at
a table made of real
wood. The interior of
O'Rorke's is decorated in
a subdued fashion de
signed to make the diner
feel comfortable without
overloading the senses.
Let's talk food qual
ity. Since O'Rorke's of
fers both pub food and
more substantial entrees,
I felt it my duty to sample
some of each. I decided
to try the breaded mush
rooms as well as the scal
lops wrapped in bacon as
my appetizers. My gen
eral rule of thumb is that
deep-frying makes any
thing taste better.

This was true of the
mushrooms. I was pleas
antly surprised that the
mushrooms were not
overly greasy, yet they
maintained their crispi
ness. This large portion
of mushrooms served
with a thick marinara
sauce for dipping is a
pleasure to consume.
For those with a
more sophisticated pal¬

ate, I would strongly rec
ommend the scallops
wrapped in bacon.
O'Rorke's serves five me
dium scallops, each gen
erously wrapped in ba
con, providing for an ex
quisite taste. The me
dium size of scallops used
was perfect since very
large scallops don't take
on the flavor of the ba
con well.

After the mush
rooms and scallops
stimulated my appetite, it
was time to order my
dinner. As far as classic
pub sandwiches are con
cerned, a Reuben pro¬

vides an excellent benchmark.
If the mix of corned beef,
Swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and
Russian dressing is not cor
rect, the sandwich becomes a
dismal failure.
I must say it was the best
Reuben that I have had in this
town. The sauerkraut to
dressing ratio was perfect.
The thick, hearty slabs of rye
bread filled with enough
seeds to make any dentist
scream were a thing of beauty.
Like all of O'Rorke's
many sandwiches, the
Reuben is served with French
fries and your choice of apple
fritters, homemade coleslaw,
or applesauce. I opted for the
homemade coleslaw and was

not disappointed. The cole
slaw is not an ordinary cole
slaw; in fact, it is truly con
sidered to be a cabbage salad.
I am not a fan of coleslaw, but
I loved the cabbage salad. I
also decided to try one of
O'Rorke's entrees.
I chose the marinated
pork tenderloin that was
served with a sweet apple
dressing on a bed of rice. The
pork itself was excellent; it
was moist and tender. Pork is
a meat that is very easy to
overcook. An overcooked
piece of pork can be so tough
and dry that it is nearly ined
ible. This was far from the
case with the pork tenderloin
at O'Rorke's. The apple
dressing had a mild, sweet fla
vor that complemented the
meat quite well.

Finally the rice was ac
tually well-cooked. Rice, un
like pasta, is not supposed to
be served al dente. Many res
taurants need to learn that
rice should not fight back
when you bite into it.
O'Rorke's rice was light and

Dear Libby,
I just watched a student
on crutches struggle to get in
the Library. Please consider
getting one of those auto-door
things. (Unsigned)
Dear unsigned,
Thank you for taking the
time to write. Libby appreci
ates a thoughtful, considerate
message once in a while. How
nice to hear from someone who

FLYIN6 BOOKS,
BURNING BALLS

cares about the well-being of a
fellow student.
Libby knows that the
front doors are heavy, and awk
ward, and a problem for any
one on crutches or in a wheel
chair. She will pass your con
cern on to the Facilities Depart
ment. Robin Wagner, library
director, told Libby she's had
conversations with Facilities
about the door problem in the
past and that they are trying to
come up with a solution.

Libby,
When are you getting the
connectors for portables that
we can check-out?(No signa
ture)
Dear Disconnected,
The cables are available at
the circulation desk in two
lengths— 12 short ones and 12
long ones. Bring your ID and
check out a cable the same way
you check out a book. Active
data jacks are marked with a
green dot all around the library,
and there is a new bank of plug
in work tables on the main
floor halfway back on the right.

Dear Libby, Sent to Libby via email on
We don't need stupid 3/9/00:
lockers. What we need is com- Bring the phones
puters. 30 computers for 2,000 back!!!!!!!
students is not enough. (No sig- 3:oi PM Terminal 800
nature)

03:27 PM Terminal 800 suggestions to Libby at email
Imussel or drop a note in the
Dear Terminal 800, suggestion box on the front desk.

Dear Nameless,
For your information the
locker service is very important
and has absolutely nothing to

do with how many computers
are available in public labs at
the College. Many students
have requested lockers so they
don't have to haul their be
longings back and forth to the
library. Libby can't keep up
with the demand for lockers.
So you are probably in the
minority if you think having
lockers is stupid.
Libby asked Mike
Hayden in IR (that's Informa
tion Resources) to comment
on your complaint about too
few computers. He told Libby
that a typical ratio of students
per public computers is 20:1
at other institutions.
Gettysburg has over 100 lab
machines (including those in
the library) and over 100 ad-

\
Libby is printing your two
vulgar messages just to show
your classmates how narrow
and unimaginative you are.
Take an English course pal. You
need to improve your vocabu-
lary. If you want to gab on the
phone use one ot the three cam-
pus phones on the ground floor
but don't bore me with this sort
of nonsense.
Darts to the male College
student with too much time on
his hands at 3 a.m., who thinks
it is cute to drop books from the
fourth floor down to the
ground floor in the central stair
well and split the spines. I hope
you realize that it costs us $8.00
minimum to get a book re
bound. I bet your pals love
knowing that we have to spend
their tuition dollars to clean up
after your little prank.
Darts to the vandals who
smashed in the thermostats in
the second and third study bays
on the second floor of the h-
brary, so that they had to be re-
placed at considerable expense.
Double darts to the per
son who ripped out the thermo-
static controls in the first study
bay on the second floor and left
exposed wires. For your infor-
mation, if some helpful person
had wandered by and had tried <
to put that box back together [
they could have been electro-
cuted. Thank goodness House- ]
keeping found it first, or some
body would be in the obituary [
column today. If you're chilly
find another place to study or
put on a sweater.
Triple darts to the juvenile
delinquent male College stu-
dents spotted by your class-
mates setting ping pong halls on
fire on the fourth floor. Not a
good idea, to say the least '
Send your comments and

ditional machines in private
but generally accessible labs
(such as in Physics, Sociology
and in the other classroom
buildings). You do the math.
That is close to a 10:1 ratio.
Mr. Hayden added,
"Adding public computers is an
expensive undertaking since
all computers have to be peri
odically replaced to keep them
up to date. We try to update
all desktop and workstation
computers on a 4 year cycle.
IR is responsible for over 1000
machines on campus repre
senting a replacement expense
of over $2,000,000 typically
every 4 years. Everybody
would like to have even more,
but the cost, maintenance and
support is prohibitive."

He also mentioned that
over 85% of all Gettysburg
students come with their own
personal computers. Is there
really is a problem?

We need the phones on
the second floor back!

of my meal, I felt as though
I had eaten at a favorite

a restaurant.
In this day and age of
fast food and mass-produced
meals, O'Rorke's is pleasant
change of pace. O'Rorke's
is an establishment that any
student can feel comfortable
going to alone or with
friends and family for a meal
or even just a drink. 1 would
strongly recommend Paddy
O'Rorke's to any senior who
has not yet made plans for
dinner with the family after
graduation.





The case for library
security phones
I want to respond to your edito
rial in the Opinion section of the last
issue of the Gettysburgian about the li
brary security phones.
Two years ago we installed emer
gency telephones in the library in re
sponse to student concerns about safety.
Some of you told us that they did not
always feel safe studying in the library,
especially at more isolated tables and
carrels. Some of you complained about
being harassed while studying. Some
of you said you felt uncomfortable
studying late at night when there were
not a lot or people around.
We know that there are parts of
the library that are not well lit. We are
open 24, but only have one staff mem
ber on duty during the long night hours.
He can't patrol the building and watch
the front desk. Students raised these
issues with us in several forums—in

Letters to the Editor

person, in the suggestion box and at
Student Senate meetings.
We responded. As a result we
asked Security to increase their build
ing patrols after midnight, added light
ing, put a security camera at the front
door, moved carrels from the dark cor
ners and installed safety phones on each
floor. The intention of the red phones
was always safety and security. The idea
was to have these phones ring right to
Security from the very beginning. That
wasn't possible until the installation of
the new phone system last semester.
How much money was spent altering
the phones? None. The switch cost
nothing and was merely a programming
change.
We are sympathetic to the points
you raise in your editorial. Emergen
cies ot all kinds do come up. We know
that. We know you may have to make «i
quick call from time to time. That is
why we have always had campus phones

on the ground floor (three) to make
those important calls about dinner plans
or study groups.
There is no need to leave build
ing and go over to Stme as your col
umn suggests. You can simply take the
elevator to the ground floor. This is
nothing new. Those phones have al
ways been available on the ground floor.
The campus phones are on the
ground floor for a reason. This is not
designated for quiet study as the upper
floors are. You asked for quiet desig
nations on some of the floors and we
agree that it is a good idea. Judging from
the complaints we've had about exten
sive phone calls to friends, irritable stu
dents asking us to tell someone to be
quiet (including offers to rip the phones
out of the wall if the party on the line
does not hang up), and what we've
observed ourselves, we think keeping
the quiet floors quiet is a priority for
many.

Your column ends with the ques
tion: "Besides, how many fires, robber
ies, assaults actually take place in the
library?" You might be surprised at the
amount of theft that occurs— text
books, calculators, jewelry, gloves and
other articles of clothing. We have had
incidents of stalking and harassment.
The week before spring break there was
a fire on the fourth floor. Students set
ping pong balls on fire, threw them in
the trash can and started a fire. Thanks
to the red phones this incident was
quickly reported and the fire extin
guished.
Your closing sentence is a clever
way to end your column, but, in truth,
there IS a need for building security. We
are committed to your safety and the
rights of those students who need a
quiet place to work. The ground floor
isn't so far to go to make a personal call
when you think of it in the context of a
greater good. You call for a "middle
ground." I think we're there.

Well, that ends my picks, except for my pick for Best Foreign Film
which goes to Wales's Solomon and Gaenor. I haven't technically seen
it, but it stars loan Gruffudd (star of the Horatio Hornblower films on
A&E and Great Expectations on PBS). I can't say enough good things
about him, so that film must be qood, too.

pictures nominated, but I will make some judg
ments based on what I've seen.
The two main contenders for the Best Pic
ture award are The Cider House Rules and
American Beauty, both of which I've seen. I re
ally enjoyed both, though they are quite differ
ent movies. Both, however, are sort of coming
of-age movies—one of a young boy and one of
a suburban husband. Both stories are compel
ling and the acting in each is superb. I'm going
to give my personal preference to Cider House
Rules. I don't know why—they were both very
good movies.
For Best Actor I'm going to go with Kevin
Spacey from American Beauty. His acting im
pressed me a lot in the movie as his character
transformed from a put-upon executive to a man
with a will of his own. I now regard Kevin Spacey
as an acting god.
Best Actress in my book could go to just
about anyone. The only movie I saw from this
category was American Beauty, but I will say
that Annette Bening was really good in it.

For Best Supporting Actor, a lot of talk is
going for Haley Joel Osment from The Sixth
Sense. Not having seen that, I'm going to put a
word in for Jude Law from The Talented Mr.
Ripley. He stole the movie from Matt Damon
and Gwyneth Paltrow_, which in and of itself is
impressive.
I can't say anything about Supporting Ac
tress, since I haven't seen any of those movies.

Letters to the Editor

Still waiting for a
colorblind society
Several weeks ago, The
Gettysburg/an published an
opinion column with the star
tling title "Racism and homi
cide: accepted practices at Get
tysburg?" I can't say whether
the title was the author's or the
editor's idea, but it certainly
compelled me, as someone
morally opposed to both rac
ism and homicide, to read just
what atrocities were going on
here. I soon learned that
Stephen Cassanno was taking
aim at two policies to which he
is opposed: affirmative action
and abortion. His remarks are
directed against the enactment
of these policies anywhere, not
specifically at Gettysburg Col
lege. Still, as the affirmative
action officer of the College, I
want to address Mr.
Cassanno_'s points regarding
what he has chosen to charac¬

ze as .
Mr. Cassarino's argu
ments against affirmative ac
tion are not new. His first point
is that affirmative action dis
criminates against whites. The
myth of reverse discrimination
is a powerful one; it appeals to
those who see their exclusive
access to opportunity being
(even minutely) eroded by the
influx of women and people of
color into the workplace. In
the past, when men only hired
men, or whites only hired
whites, we didn't call that "af¬

firmative action." That's just
the way things worked. For
those individuals born after the
Civil Rights movement of the
1960's, it may seem incredible
that blatant discrimination
went unchallenged for genera
tion after generation. Affirma
tive action was needed, and still
is needed, because without
some outside pressure, many
employers would simply revert
to hiring individuals - based not
on who is most qualified - but
based on who seems to "fit in"
best.

Mr. Cassarino's second
point against affirmative action
is that it insults minorities by

implying that they cannot com
pete on merit alone. There are
a few black public figures who
have made the same claim, Su
preme Court Justice Clarence
Thomas (himself the benefi
ciary of affirmative action) per
haps the most prominent
among them. But these indi
viduals are clearly outnum
bered by those people of color,
and many whites as well, who
recognize that in a society still
plagued by prejudice, the evalu
ation of merit is not an unbi
ased process.
To defend his argument
against affirmative action, Mr.
Cassanno unwisely quotes the
visionary words of Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. who dreamt of
a world in which people would
"not be judged by the color of
their skin, but by the content
of their character." We all still

long for Dr. King s dream of a
color-blind society, of a world
in which people would not
make negative assumptions
about a person's character or
intelligence or talent based
upon nothing more than that
person's skin color. When that
day comes, we will have no
need for programs that encour
age diversity; we will have
achieved true diversity. But to
quote a recent court decision
involving affirmative action:
"Under some circumstances, to
be color blind actually means
to favor the group that has had
and continues to have superior
access to the opportunities for

advancement in our society."
Affirmative action is any pro
active measure taken to ensure
access to opportunity for those
whom history has shown us
would otherwise be over
looked.
It seems so patently ob
vious to say that everyone
should be judged on his or her
own merits, and if you are
white, chances are that is how
you always have been judged.
But if you are a person of color
trying to succeed in life, you
know that before you can
prove your merit, you have to
be able to get beyond people's
prejudices. Real progress has
been made in the past several

decades — largely as a result
of the legislation that came out
of the Civil Rights era — but
Dr. King's ideal of a color-blind
society has not yet become re
ality. All of us, however, can
examine the content of oui
own characters and consider
how we can move our lives, our
college, and our country closer
to that ideal.

Ike's does no jus
tice to a great man
I enjoyed the informative
letter "We should all like Ike"
in the March 9 issue of The
Gettysburgian. The letter pro
vided the reader a good synop
sis of the life of our 34th presi
dent, Dwight D. Eisenhower.
However, I take issue with the
quest of the writer to name the
new Italian eatery above the
Bullet Hole in honor of
Eisenhower. I would hope the
College would reserve
Eisenhower's name for some
edifice a bit more noteworthy
than a place to eat. Among his
many notable achievements,
Dwight D. Eisenhower was a
Trustee of the College, and he
deserves more fitting recogni
tion.

The Eisenhower National
Historic Site, the Eisenhowers'
presidential and retirement
home, is only three miles via
shuttle bus from Gettysburg. I
invite the entire Gettysburg
College community to visit the
Site and experience the home
and farm that have changed
very little since the days when
world leaders routinely visited.
Here Eisenhower practiced his
own brand of personal diplo
macy and made the world a
safer place for all of us to live
in today. The Site is accessible
via shuttle bus from the Na
tional Park Service Visitor Cen
ter in Gettysburg.

Three Rhode Island students suspended for pro-abortion poster

by Rchel Hanson
Columnist
Last Thursday, about 50
Providence College students
gathered to protest the suspen
sion of three of their classmates
last month.
Daniel Pastrana, Patrick
Moran and Christopher White
were suspended because the
administration of the Roman
Catholic college felt that they
had improperly used an image
of the Virgin Mary on a flier.
The three were putting up post
ers on a classroom door last
month, when a priest, who was
also a professor of theology,
arrived for class and saw the
posters. He immediately or
dered them to stop and re
ported their terrible act to the
administration. All three men
were suspended for the remain
der of the semester and one
(Pastrana) lost his full tuition
scholarship.

An animal? All interesting (and
bizarre) possibilities, but all
wrong.
Instead, a commonly
used picture of the Virgin Mary
was placed on a flier that said,
"How's this for an immaculate
concept: Keep Abortion Safe
and Legal." That's it. And now
the lives of these three students
are ruined.
I know that manv ot you
are saying to yourselves that
they should not have used such
a sacred image to promote a
cause the Church is adamantly
against, especially in such a pre
dominantly Catholic setting.
Perhaps you are right. But,
there is this tin) little thing in
our Constitution called free
dom of speech that seems to be
forgotten here!

Granted, the executive
director of the American Civil
Liberties Union in Rhode Is
land has said that anv legal
challenge to the suspensions
would likely tail because the
First Amendment does not ap
ply to private colleges. How
ever, one would think that an\
sensible private college would
grant this most basic _ot human
rights to its -students anwvav

The way they portrayed
the Virgin Mary must have
been pretty terrible, right? Per
haps she was portrayed in a
sexual manner? Maybe even
having sex? With a woman?

Apparently, Providence College
is not one such school.
I have seen, heard and
read a number of things on this
campus that have offended,
shocked and infuriated me—
very much, in fact. And many
of these have appeared in this
very newspaper in the form of
both opinion columns and let
ters to the editor. However, I
would never, ever expect or
support someone suspending
these authors for their views. I
would not even support the
editors leaving them out of the
paper for tear of offending
someone. They have as many
rights as the next person to
speak their minds—they should
not be suppressed because
someone is offended or dis
agrees with them.

A person's college years
are often a time when they test
out many ideas and theories
and form opinions of their
own. This certainly cannot be
accomplished it students are
not allowed to debate all top
ics, including (and especially)
the really tough and controver
sial ones, such as abortion. I
ha\c a teoling that these stu
dents weie suspended not so

much because they "defiled
the image of the Virgin Mary,
but rather because they have a
different opinion on abortion
than the college and the admin
istration.
I think that some stu
dents, faculty and administra
tors were offended by the opin
ions of these students, not the
use of the Virgin Mary. Thank
fully, not every private college
suspends their students who
have ideas that offend others,
or I would have been out of
here a long time ago! Instead,
we have realized that opposing
viewpoints lead to discussion
and debate, which leads to
those on both sides almost al
ways learning from each other.
After all, isn't college supposed
to be about learning?

Providence College sus
pended these three men for
daring to speak their mind on
a subject they knew would not
be well received. Rather than
being punished so harshly, they
should be praised for having
the strength and courage to
make their opinions public and
stand by them, no matter how
different and controversial they
may be.

Spring Break is a time for
millions of college students to
flock to exotically warm places
across the country for a self
righteous endeavor, or ritual if
you will, of drinking way too
much, having flings with
people with unnaturally good
bodies, and watching wet T
shirt contests while dancing to
MTV Jams. Well, this is what
the average beer commercial
would have you think, but for
the majority of people this is
not so. I suppose I have just as
much issue with the image of
the ritual as I have with those
who purposely degrade them
selves by conforming to a silly
stereotype while putting them
selves at risk for a whole con¬

glomeration of future ailments.
For the majority of us
Spring Break is a necessary pe
riod of rest from the rigors of
academia and a time which we
can reflect on and enjoy with
our family or closest friends. I
too over these last few years
have jaunted to Florida in
search of a mythological time
with bikini-clad women serving
me chilled drinks in a hot tub.
However, after much searching
of the local hot spots, I realized
that as a short man clad in linen
that the only person who
would be serving me drinks was
myself or a nice fellow we all
know as Jewett. Although this
was a swell time (to coin a
phrase that should come back:
see Moxie), it was not the ideal
that Budweiser and the rest of

the world would have you
think. So I decided to end my
search for the mythological
Garden of Eden which spawns
these scantily clad servants of
chubby men in bad shirts and
unbelievably short shorts, and
dedicate myself to having a re
laxing time with my family and
friends both away and here in
Gettysburg. I know this sounds
uneventful, truly it wasn't, but
it all depends upon your per
spective now doesn't it?

For example, how many
of you out there actually enjoy
drinking gut-rot beer chased
down with a shot off of some
sweaty chest of gut-rot tequila?
Call this a survey; because it
doesn't sound like all it's
cracked up to be. It's funny
because nobody thinks that this
"swell time' could actually be
detrimental to your health.
Now I am not the best person
to advocate a healthy lifestyle,
and I'll admit that. But many
of you consider yourselves
healthy people with all of the
skimpy salads I see at Servo
everyday that constitute a ma
jor meal. In addition, seldom

is the workout room (splendid
location by the way!) ever not
busy during the day which
points to the diligence of the
average" student to sweat out
those calories from two-dollar
pitcher night (except for the
underagers because we know
that you have no idea what that
!S). So why is there so much
hypocrisy in the whole Spring
break bit? All you are doing is
giving your mind a break, but
for many of us, our bodies are
exhausted after a week of ut
ter depravity. I'm no puritan
mind you, and if there is any
hypocrisy about this column it

is mine, but it still makes no
sense whatsoever. People re
lax by torturing their bodies in
multiple ways.
For example, when
you're down south in Barbados
or wherever, it is freakin' hot.
This means that your body will
get dehydrated, which means
that senseless amounts of booze
isn't a good thing. Oh, and that
person who seemed really great
and who was a fun hook up just
gave you the clap as well. So
now you're dehydrated with a
STD. Great way to spend my
break how's about yours? Be
sides that, I have seen enough
orange people this week to ri¬

val the Umpa-Loompas in
Charlie and the Chocolate Fac
tory. DIRECT SUN CAUSES
CANCER, not to mention a
whole lot of other things like
cataracts. But that leathery dis
position will be real attractive
in twenty-five years.
In looking this over I
seem really bitter about this
whole Spring Break issue. I
guess that's just because I
wasn't sitting on the beach of
the Dominican Republic with
a Margarita and a waiter run
ning to get me another for 50
cents. Hey, that's life though.
At least I am not a candidate
for melanoma.

trout the Conservative Corner Big Brother is counting you

by Dan Ballentyne
Columnist
Last week the Census
Bureau distributed the census
forms for the year 2000. In this,
the last census of the twentieth
century, we see the largest in
trusion of big government into
our lives that we have ever seen
in an American census, espe
cially the long form, which this
article will discuss. In the ad
vertisements for the census, we
also see distortions of its pur
pose. Racist questions were
also asked. Finally, the long
form violates a ruling from the
Supreme Court.
The census appears in the
Constitution in only two
places, Article I, Section Two,
and Amendment Fourteen, sec
tion two, which modifies the

first appearance. In the Consti
tution, the law of the land, the
only stated purpose for the cen
sus was to count the people to
apportion representatives to
the several states. Nowhere at
all is the distribution of federal
money mentioned in the Con
stitution in regards to the cen
sus; that's not why we have a
census. The census is to count
the people to apportion repre
sentatives, period. Coinciden
tally, there is little information
they need to determine that;
name, address, telephone num
ber, age, and citizenship is the
minimum amount of informa
tion needed. Marital status,
schooling, and English profi
ciency could also be beneficial.
Beyond that, any other infor
mation is extraneous to the
purpose of the census.

But even deeper than that
is the question of how much the
government has the right to
know. 7 he census this year asks
how you get to work, how
many people ride to work with
you, even when you leave for
work and come back home. It
then goes on to ask what kind
of work you do and about your
duties at work. The census then
goes on to ask for a detailed
account of your income. Yes, if

the oppressive IRS was not
enough, the Census bureau
wants the information too.
Then it goes on to ask you
about your home: how many
rooms you have, how you pay
for it, your bathrooms, and the
cost of utilities. The govern
ment has no need, and no right
to ask you these questions.
That is private information. If
anyone on the street asked you
that, how many of you would
tell him or her? This is the same
situation. You have a right to
your privacy.
The census also shows the
ineptitude of big government.
Many of the questions outside
of those needed to count the
people other agencies have.

The IRS has your income in
formation. If you take the un
employment numbers and add
the welfare numbers to them,
you get the amount of people
who do not have jobs, and so
on. There is also racism in the
census. No less than three times
does the census ask you to clas
sify yourself on the basis of
race. As we leave the twentieth
century, we should be moving
beyond classifying people on
the basis of race. By having that
classification, it is implied that
there is a difference between
the races. This only fosters dis
crimination, in this case
through the racist policy of af
firmative action. It is also a raise

assumption; there is no differ
ence between the races, in fact
there are no races, we are all
human.
Finally the long form spe
cihcally violates a court order.
The Clinton administration last
year attempted to have the cen
sus done by representative sam
pling so as to rig it to aid the
drawing of districts to favor the
Democratic Party. The Su
preme Court ruled that there
would be NO sampling of the
American people in the census.
The long form was only sent to

one-sixth of the people. That
is a sample, and a direct viola
tion of the Supreme Court.
Finally, I urge all Ameri
cans to participate in the cen
sus, but with a proviso. Do not
answer the questions the cen
sus should not ask (and there
are more than I mentioned).
You should do your part for
your country and our demo
cratic process, which means an
swering your census, but not
those questions that the gov
ernment should not have
asked.

Who ever thought that a
flag would be the center of a
growing national debate? One
hundred and thirty five years
after the Civil War ended, re
uniting our nation, the Confed
erate flag still flies over the state
capital building in Columbia,
South Carolina. For the past
few months this controversy
has been plastered everywhere
— in every major news maga
zine, newspaper, and television
news program.
After the heat surround
ing the South Carolina repub
lican primary died down, the
question of the flag escaped
from many people's minds. But
the question still remains:
Should the Confederate flag be
flown in such a public, govern
ment- owned place?

It is time to lay the Old South to
rest

The South Carolina gov
ernment maintains that the
Confederacy is a part of their
history as a state. It is cultur
ally revered within South Caro_^
lina society. They believe that
they should have a right to fly

the flag wherever they want.
Supporters believe that it hon
ors the men who fought and
died in the Civil War. They
believe that it is a proud dis
play of Southern heritage.
Others, namely the
NAACP, believe differently.
They maintain that the Confed
erate flag is a symbol of racism
that is a part of America's past,
but should not be part of
America's future. They believe
that it is a constant reminder
of the era of slavery, and that it
should stay a thing of the past,

an obstacle that the United
States as a whole has overcome.
Who is right? Should the
state of South Carolina have
the right to fly whatever flag it
chooses? Are they not pro
tected by the First Amendment,
considering this is freedom of
expression? And what about
Georgia and Mississippi, the
only two states in the nation
who have the Confederate flag
as a part of their state flag?
Should they be reprimanded
for what they believe is part of
their heritage?
It is evident that South
Carolina is feeling the repercus¬

sions of the NAACP boycott on
their state. While South Caro
lina is not suffering economi
cally, the state's reputation is
waning. Many conventions
and other such events have
been moved to other states be
cause of South Carolina's con
troversial nature. College re
cruitment has also been tough
this year. State schools are re
porting that they are having a
hard time recruiting people for
sports teams. Presidential can
didates had to tiptoe around
such touchy issues to not of
tentl the South Carolina con¬

stituents, and also not to offend
the rest of the nation.
So, if it is okay for South
Carolina to Hy the Confeder
ate flag with the United States
flag, would it not be okay for
Germany to fly the Nazi swas
tika flag with its national flag?
After all, the era of Nazism was
a part of their history, and
while Jewish people arc seen as
"leal" people now, the other
Germans should be able to be
proud of their N_.ui hentage.
Doesn't that sound ridiculous?
Well, it sounds just like
the hict that African-Americans

wae
treated less than human in the
antebellum era (and had to
fight to be treated equally in the
twentieth century, a freedom
that they only received thirty
years ago), but people still feel
as though they should be able
to fly the banner of the Con
federacy (which preached that
African-Americans were not
human and that they were only
good enough to be enslaved
persons) because it is a part of
their heritage.
The Confederacy has not
been in existence for over one
hundred years. The Confed
eracy surrendered to'the Union
in April of 1865, and, as a na
tion, we went through the pro
cess of reconstruction together.
Why must the South hold onto
the romantic illusion of the

antebellum period? The year
2000 does not hold the same
values and expectations of the
antebellum era. South Caro
lina should let go of the past
and move towards the future,
by first letting go of that Con
federate flag and the issues and
feelings it represents.

This week, Gettysburg
College played host to a con
gressional debate between six
of the seven candidates for the
seat of Congressman Bill
Goodhng who is retiring after
thirteen terms in the House.
Republicans hold a size
able majority in the district, giv
ing them a substantial advan
tage at retaining the seat. The
last time a Democrat held the
nineteenth congressional dis
trict was in the Democratic
landslide year of 1964. They

lost the seat two years later as
Republicans rebounded. The
district is unique in that this
year will be the first time since
1958 that a Goodling will not
be running. Before Bill
Goodling was elected to Con
gress in 1974, his father George
held the seat from 1961 to
1965 and again from 1967 to
1975. Five Republicans are vy
ing to replace Goodling. After
the debate, on which my room
mate Ted Hartman and I had
the honor to serve as the stu
dent panelists, I can say that I
was extremely impressed with
our Republican candidates.

Each eloquently defended Re
publican principles and the
need for the Republicans to
retain control of Congress and
to elect George W. Bush presi
dent of the United States.
A distinct difference ot
opinion emerged between the
four Republicans and the two
Democrats on the debate plat
form. Unfortunately, one ot
the Republicans, York County
Commissioner Chris Reilly,
chose not to attend, but the all
of the Republicans were far
superior to their Democratic
counterparts. Democrats John
Moran and Jeffrey Sanders
showed themselves to be left of

the f';idn/tfnm\s fulfill
District Congressional candidates present
strong competition

Dick Gephardt as they came
out against the ban on partial
birth abortion and despite our
surpluses, against common
sense tax reductions to keep
our prosperity going.
The Republicans, State
Representatives Al Masland
and Todd Platts, along with
Charlie Gerow and Dick
Stewart, all came out for the
enforcement of current gun
control laws, which the
Clinton-Gore Administration
fails to do. Each called for tax
reductions and promised to
work with President George W.

Bush to cut taxes across the
board. Another theme that the
Republicans hit home on was
the need to reduce inheritance
taxes. Dick Stewart, a lawyer
and small businessman, laid out
how it is not right for farmers
and small businesspeople to
work their whole lives only to
have the government take away
what they want to pass along
to their children. Charlie
Gerow, who is running for
Congress for the third time this
year, called tor the repeal of the
gas tax pioposed by Bill
Clinton and enacted by Al
Gore's tie-breaking vote in

1993. Ot all of the Republicans,
1 believe that Al Masland would
make the strongest Congress
man for south central Pennsyl
vania. Masland, who was
elected to the legislature in
1992 and is a former district
attorney, is experienced at get
ting things done. In the State
House he led the effort for lob
byist disclosure and ethics re
form. He was a leader in the
effort to pass a tough anti-rape
law and punish corrupt legis
lators. Fven though both
Masland and Todd Platts serve
togethei m Harnsburg, their
colleagues are overwhelmingly

sup- __ _H
porting
Masland because they know he
will have a strong voice in Con
gress. Tuesday night, Todd
Platts seemed, at times, to ar
gue that we could just spend
our way out of all of our prob
lems. Platts called for more
federal spending on education
and came out against school
choice. On top of that, Platts
argued that the way to help spe
cial education is by more fed
eral involvement. What needs
to happen is for the federal gov
ernment to return more money
and power to the states, while
it serves as goal setter who can
help states when the need is
there.

The outcome of the April
4th primary will be interesting.
The district covers three coun
ties; York, Cumberland and
Adams. York is the population
center and has controlled the
seat for the last forty years.
Both Platts and Reilly are from
York County, while Masland,
Stewart and Gerow are from
Cumberland County. With
those three splitting the
Cumberland vote and Platts
and Reilly splitting York
County, then the smallest of the
three, Adams, could play a de
cisive role in what is an excit
ing election.
Supporters of each of
these Republicans must remem
ber that despite the faults of
any of these candidates they are
far better than the alternative.
All the Democrats need are six
more seats and Speaker Dick
Gephardt will become a real
ity. Democrats win when we
divide and control of the Con
gress is too crucial for us to split
apart.

is closed. That's a useful fea¬

ure. The real reasons why you
want to have a land barge are
as follows: You want to be in a
vehicle from which you can see
over everyone else on the road
except the bigger trucks. You
want to be able to safely run
everyone else off the road ex
cept the bigger trucks. You
want to survive any accident by
killing everyone else on the
road with a smaller car and
have 27 cup holders, two TV/
VCR combos, six independent
headphone jacks, three com
puter terminals and a small
kitchenette for you and your
family of five wherever you go.

I can understand the need
for a vehicle like an SUV if you
are towing large things on a
regular basis. I can understand
the need for a SUV if you are
constantly doing work that de
mands four-wheel drive like my
father. He is a forester and goes
out into the woods on a regu
lar basis. I can even be under
standing of someone who lives
in a rural area in the northern
latitudes where the roads aren't
plowed as often in winter. But
the majority of people who

own SUVs are pretentious
wannabes who have never seen
a dirt road, much less taken
their vehicle off-road.
Get over yourselves. You
don't need all ot that space, all
of that ground clearance, and
just because you are bigger does
not give you permission to run

we sure don't need you putting

The Gettysburg College
Women's Lacrosse team is off
to a winning start this season.
They kicked off the 2000
spring season on March 3 with
a loss to seventh ranked, Mary
Washington.
During spring break, Get
tysburg headed west to Colo
rado Springs, Colorado for a
week of training and three con
tests. Their first challenge in
this new terrain was the alti
tude, which at first made
breathing more difficult. How
ever, the team adapted more
than adequately, which is evi
dent from the scores they re
corded in all three games.

Lady Laxers ride three-game win streak to No. 15 Ranking

The first game of the
week took place at Colorado
College against the University
of Puget Sound. The final score
of this matchup was 26-2, Get
tysburg.
Becky Bucha tallied five
goals, while Amy Stambaugh

found the net three times and
had four assists. Kim
Fernandez pounded four goals
in and had one assist. This
game was the Bullets single
highest game total since April,
1986 in a 29-4 victory over
Washington (Md.)
Freshman Kathyrn
Grassel added a hat trick, the
first three goals of her colle
giate career, while Abby Usher,
Emily Waldron, and Seedorf
tipped in two more apiece.
The Bullets raised the
spread to ten goals before the

offense of Puget Sound even
began to answer the call. At
tacker Candace Fisch helped
the Bullets attack with three as
sists in the contest.
Later that day, the Laxers
packed up for yet another game
against Regis University in
Denver. Fatigue from the game
earlier in the day and acclama
tion to the altitude proved to
be no obstacle for the team.
The Bullets finished the day
with another win, this time 20
0. As the Bullets built their

lead, the women held to a goal minutes of this contest. Bucha
a minute pace foi the fust nine added torn i»oals loi the Lady

£

Sophomore attack Becky Bucha (right) leads the Bullets in
goals scored this season with 17. She was recently named
to the Centennial Conference Weekly Honor Roll.

Laxers and Haugen added
three. Freshmen Kate
Mernken and Ashley Froman
each scored two goals, as did
juniors Seedorf and Susie
Mitchell. Stambaugh also
scored once with two assists.
The win marks the first
time since 1991 that Gettys
burg recorded a shutout.
In the last game of their
attack on the west, the Bullets
again triumphed. Because of
snow and rain, this final con
test was moved to a Denver
high school where the Bullets
faced Colorado College.
Bucha knocked in four
goals and Stambaugh dished in
another two as Gettysburg ran
away, completing their Colo
rado sweep. Mernken added
another two goals and
Fernandez and Haugen
chipped in one apiece.

This victory did not come
without out some tremendous
midfield play by Seedorf, who
found many key ground balls
and owned the double teams in
transition. Centrella also had
a great showing posting 12
saved in the 60-minute contest.

During the break the
men's lacrosse team stayed
north to take care of business
on the field. The worthwhile
week ended with the team gar
nering three wins.
The first game of the
week, which was perhaps the
most important, was against
Washington 8c Lee in Lexing
ton, Va. The Generals were
ranked No. 2 in the nation and
also held a four-garne winning
streak against the Bullets.
The Bullets were deter
mined to earn a win over a ri
val and national powerhouse.
The game proved to be a de
fensive battle, but the Bullets
came out with a 6- 4 victory,
outscorine the Generals 2-0 in

Men's Lacrosse Undefeated After 3-0 Week

the fourth quarter to ensuie a
win. The Bullets outshot the
Generals, 28-23. Attackman
Tommy Pearce led the team
with two goals. Ric Bremer
and Ross Garretson each
scored one goal and had one
assist. Bremer's goal proved to
be pivotal as it clinched
Gettysburg's victory.
Andrew Barter led the
Bullet defense with eleven saves
in the net.
In the first home game of
the season, the Bullets rolled
past Widener, 14-3. The bar
rage of Bullet scores was sup
ported by a 49-18 shooting ad
vantage.
Gettysburg broke open a
1-1 tie after the first quarter to
score five goals in the second,
and a total of 10 in the middle
two periods.

Bremer tied a i.aieei high
with five goals, leading the
team in scoring foi the contest.
Garretson, Pearce, and Pete
Milhman each tallied a pan of
goals. This past Saturday, the
Bullets hosted No. 12
Renssalaer. Rolling on the
steam of a big win versus Wash
ington &C Lee and the rout of
Widener, the men extended
their win streak to four games
and left their perfect record
intact. Pearce led the team with
four goals. Milhman added
three goals, while Garretson
tallied two goals and one assist.
Barter came up with nine
saves in the net.

Packed with an veteran lineup

Liquid Magma. Haberno pep
pers. That babe on the beach in
Cancun. Three very hot things. How
ever, none of these even compare to the
scorching temperature of John Campo's
Bullet Baseball team.
After the team's recent trip to
Florida, the squad stands at 8-1-1 and
is ready to burn up the Centennial Con
ference.
In the first two games of the Bul
let's season, they took on FDU-Madi
son and Alvernia respectively. Now,
sure the Bullets have great returning
pitching, but can somebody get the hit
ters out?
In the first two games, the Bullets
got more runs than Spring-Breakers re
turning from Mexico. Against FDU,
Craig Cimini and Greg Kosc led the way
offensively as the Bullets crossed home
plate 11 times.

Is this the year?

The Bullets were impressive on
the field as well, as All-Universe south
paw Drew Chiesa, the Centennial Con¬

ference Pitcher of the Week, tossed a
near flawless game, yielding no runs and
only four hits.
Against Alvernia it seemed to be
the same story, but this time with dif
ferent weapons. Sophomore sensation
Nick Marzella and junior Brett Thorp
were the offensive workhorses combin
ing for four hits and four RBI.
First baseman Marzella led the
team in hitting in Florida and is off to j
tremendous start on the season. He was
named to the Centennial Conference
Honor Roll for his performance over
the course of the week.
"Nick was the guy in Florida,"
said senior captain John Woods. "He
always got hits with men on base, he
was a real clutch guy for us."
Vassar College was next on the
Bullet's hit list as Woods and Marzella
unleashed a combined five for six per
formance that included two singles, two
doubles, a homerun and seven RBI. The
Bullets rolled as Mike Khnepeter picked
up the win on the hill.
Next was Oneonta St, the only
water that threatened the flame of the
Bullet's fire. A major contender for the

national title a year ago, Oneonta's
pitching baffled Bullet bats for the first
time of the trip.
Bullet hurler Paul Koether was
impressive on the hill. However, he was
credited with the loss as the Bullets fell,
3-0. Woods did all he could to take out
SUNY-Brockport in the Bullets next
game, but his three-for-three effort
could only produce one run, and the
Bullets tied 1-1 clue to time constraints
after the ninth inning.
J unior Brett Thorp helped the
Bullets end their two game winless slide
as he drove in two runs to lift the Bul
lets over their next foe, Case-Western.
Marzella also continued to mash as he,
Kevin Grimm and Woods also added
RBI. "It was the Case-Western game
that was really key," said senior
centerfielder Chris Lunardi. "This team
fights until the end though, and that is

what we did. That game set the tone
for the rest of the trip."
In the games that followed Get
tysburg picked up four more wins over
St. John Fisher, Richard Stockton, Mt.
Saint Mary (NY), and Keene St.
Several veterans, as well as new
faces, began to make an impression.
Freshman closer Matt Donahue was
impressive on the hill picking up two
saves, and third baseman _classmate Cliff
Mason used his stick and glove to break
into the starting lineup.
Good teams tend to win close
games. Over the last four wins, the
Bullets only outscored their opponents
by a combined ten runs.
"We started off swinging the bats
really well," said senior DH Jack Tan
ner. "Then when our hitting struggled
a little, out pitchers came through. It
was great to see."

The Bullets are hot and are look
ing to make another run at the Centen
nial Conference title.

the Bullet Baseball team is aimed at greatness

junior pncner Joe uniesna delivers a pncn to an t-uu-Maaison _oauer.
Chiesha allowed just four hits to lead the Bullets to victory and earn
Centennial Conference Player of the Week honors.
