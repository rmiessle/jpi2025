Mews Editor Two Gettysburg College
students were arrested Friday
evening for firing a peJlet-gun
from a Majestic apartment and
struck one person.
According to Gettys
burg Chief of Police Gantz, the
two students, Brian West ('00)
and Mark Baker('OO) were each
charged with one count of reck
less endangerment, one count of
conspiracy, and one count of
propulsion of a missile or pro
jectile into a roadway.
One person was hit by
the students' shooting, Laura
Whitver of 2476 Mummasburg
Road in Gettysburg. She was
uninjured by the shooting.
Whitver was unavail
able for comment at this time.

According to her husband Gary,
the two had been eating at the
Lincoln Diner with friends and
were standing in the parking lot
when they heard a loud noise
that "sounded like a BB gun."
According to Gary,
Laura felt something strike her
leg. "She didn't pay to much
attention to it, then it happened
again," he said.
The couple heard
more shots including one that
echoed and "sounded like a
twenty-two rifle," according to
Gary. Ms. Whitver contacted

the police with her personal cellular phone.
A police detective arrived, and the shoot
ing commenced again.
The detective traced the noise to
the Majestic apartment complex across the
street from the diner. The police entered
and searched the complex.
The police traced the shooting to
Baker, a resident of Majestic, and West, a
resident of Patrick. The students were ap
prehended and arrested.
West declined to comment on the
incident. "I have nothing to say at this
time," he said.
Baker was unavailable for com
ment at press time.
When asked if the incident had
soured his opinion of Gettysburg College
students, Mr. Whitversaid, "I'm not sure it
was so good to begin with."
Mr. Whitver said that the incident
did not really bother him initially, "but af
ter I began thinking about, I realized the
severity of the incident."

Mr. Whitver says that immediately
following the incident, he encountered
some Gettysburg students who he felt
"failed to recognized the severity of what
had happened."
He stated that he hoped that "the two
students don't feel any animosity toward
us. If the shoe was on the other foot, they'd
do the same thing."
He also stated "what happened
is too bad. I hope that this sends a mes
sage that this kind of stuff is not to be tol
erated."

In and Out" offers support, social activities

by Ann Mane _Bielli
Staff Writer
Many of you have prob
ably seen the numerous flyers
posted around campus for the
newly established "In and Out
group." "In and Out" is a student
support and social group for
gays, lesbians, and bisexuals
here at Gettysburg College. Bill
Gohl, the assistant Chaplain, is
the staff leader of the group and
T. J Scott and Alec Beekmans are
the student facilitators. "In and
Out" has only been active for a

short time now; however, they are
off to a very successful start. Bill
Gohl stated, the group is "off the
ground and going well, and I am
very pleased with the way it is
going." Much of this initial suc
cess is due to the support "In and
Out" has received from gay and
lesbian students involved in Al
lies and also from the support of
Margaret Anne Radford
Wedemeyer, the Associate Dean
of the College.
"In and Out" was formed
in response to students requests
and also from the voices of vari
ous administrators who believed

Gettysburg College was in need of
such a group.
Gettysburg already has the
Allies group, which also deals with
the subject of homosexuality; how
ever, the Allies group on campus is
a total community organization;
faculty, administrators, towns
people, sexual minorities, and those
who support sexual minorities all
make up the members of Allies. The
"In and Out" group on the other
hand is exclusively for gay, lesbian,
and bisexual students. There are no
townspeople or straight people in
this group and the only administra
tor involved is Bill Gohl, and he
insists his only purpose is to pro
vide the space for the students to
meet and to cook the food they eat
during their meetings.
Unlike Allies, the purpose of
"In and Out" is not education or

activism, it is strictly to provide
support and fellowship for gay, les
bian, and bisexually students. "In
and Out" is trying to facilitate a safe
space for openly gay, lesbian, and
bisexual students and also for those
who are also still "in the closet".
Alec Beekmans stated," In and Out
gives those people who are strug
gling with their feelings a good en¬

vironment to foster self esteem.
When dealing with a contro
versial subject such as homosexu
ality there is bound to be some sort
of conflicts. Fortunately, "In and
Out"' faced only minimal opposi
tion. Bill Gohl stated that one staff
member wanted to know what ex
actly Bill was telling the students
in "In and Out". She was hoping
Bill was trying to "convert them"
because she believed that was the
only way to help them get out of
sin. Bill simply responded by say
ing, "we must reach out in Christ
love to love all people, however
God created them."
There were also some nega
tive opinions voiced by students.
Some students were upset that the
assistant chaplain was going to be
a leader of a group for gays and
lesbians. However, the small
amount of controversy that did
surround the establishment of "In
and Out" did not cause any major
problems.

"In and Out" had its first
meeting last week, their next meet
ing is October 9lh _, from nine until
eleven. The meetings take place
every other week at a unknown lo
cation off campus. To participate
in "Tn anH Onf " yon must fill nut a

confidentiality contract, these
contracts are located in the CUB
and should be returned to . Bill
Gohl either by campus mail or in
person. The contract states that
members are never to disclose the
location of "In and Out's" meet
ing place or the names of anyone
who is there. Alec Beekmans has
stated that these contracts are
necessary for safety reasons only,
"It is important that students on a
campus like this feel safe."
Although Alec knows that
there have been no major "gay
bashing" activities at Gettysburg
College, he has stated that anti
gay feelings have been voiced and
therefore these confidentiality are
a necessity for the safety and se
curity of "In and Out's" members.
"In and Out" is hoping they will
be able to expand as time goes on;
therefore, their first major goal is
to bring one or two new members
to each meeting, allowing for even
more gay, lesbian, or bisexual stu
dents to be able to participate and
benefit from their worthwhile or
ganization.

REPUBLICANS- from p 2
Representing the College
Republicans as Mr. Goodling's
guests were Sophomores John
Dunlap, Rob Ricca, and Ian
Isherwood. First-year students
Cammie Grant, James Brown, and
Sara Masko also attended.
The event was held at Ski
Liberty and featured a country
western band which at times in
cluded Congressman Goodling
and his wife Hilda.
In his remarks, Represen
tative Goodling praised
Gettysburg's College Republicans
and went on to talk about upcom
ing battles in Congress.
The Congressman chairs
the United States House of Repre
sentatives Committee on Educa
tion and Workforce, which handles
all education and labor legislation,
which is of particular importance
to Gettysburg College.

Last year, he spoke be
fore Student Senate and debated
his Congressional opponents in the
College Union Building.
In his last race for Con
gress, with support from
Gettysburg's College Republicans
who campaigned for him in Get
tysburg, York, and Hanover,
Goodling was overwhelmingly re
elected with 63 percent of the vote.
Through the College Re
publicans, Goodling has extended
an invitation for any group on cam
pus to come and arrange a visit in
the United States Capitol Building.

Common Hour delivers death penalty debate

tyMkhefeFIdds stqffwriter What is your opinion of the

death penalty? This is a question that
nearly everyone has a strong opinion
about. Last week's Common Hour

addressed this issue.
The forum, titled "Deciding
on the Death Penalty," seemed to pro¬

duced mixed reactions from the audi
ence. Lisa Bartle from the Death Pen
alty Information Center in Washing
ton, D.C. came on campus to shed
some light on this very controversial
subject. Because of its long connec
tion with US history, she argued, capi
tal punishment is often excluded from
how we define cruel and unusual
punishment. Though we no longer
have public hangings in town squares,
the death penalty is still an incidence
ofexecution.
Bartle provided the audi
ence with vital statistics and data about
the issue of capital punishment.
In 1976, there were412ex
ecutions, and this year there have been
27 in Texas alone. Those 27 make up
half the total that has occurred this year
Texas, along with Florida
and Virginia are all states with high
numbers of executions. However,
there is a growing trend in the number
of states exercising their ability to use
the penalty.

"A greater number of
people are being sentenced to death,"
she said. In Pennsylvania alone, there
are over 200 people on death row.
Race has been brought into
the arguments a main factor in whether
the convicted person is executed or
spends life in prison.
According to Bartle, when
race comes into play, "it makes more
difference who the attorney is than
anything else. Even more than the
nature of the crime."
She argued that in a country
that averages 20,000 homicides per
year, a strict punishment needs to be
enforced., whether or not the answer
is the dealh penalty.
Mental retardation and
mental illness factor into the sort of
punishment that one receives. Can
they be tried or executed? Are they
competent to stand trial? These ques
tions will produce a wide variety of
answers, yet psychologists have found
that there is an extremely high rate of
mental illness among prisoners on

Death Row.
Is the Death Penalty forgiv
able? In 1970 alone, 72 Death Row
p risoners were let go because of inno
cence. Eight years is the average stay
of a Death Row inmate.
Could innocent people be
executed? _Bartle suggested that States

are taking away money, lawyers, and
time from Death Rowprisoners, which
may lead to cases that are investigated
less thoroughly. If this happens, more
innocent people could be convicted.
Of the 3309 total American
prisoners on Death Row, she asked,
"how many do you think are inno
cent ?" Bartle projected that "it is
very likely in 1997 to see more execu
tions." 54 execution have already
taken place and in the next four weeks,
17 more are scheduled , though she
stated "that doesn't necessarily mean
that it will go through."
Ms. Bartle also addressed
issues of politics , which are closely
tied to the subject of capital punish
ment She claimed that "politi
cians don't publicize that executions
are taking place, yet as politicians, we
are in favor of it." She noted that the
issue is often used in election and then
disposed of.

She also noted that
Pennsylvania's Governor Tom Ridge
signs death warrants regularly, and sets
dates for executions. Bartle suggested
that this was Ridge's way of saying
"Look what I'm doing." This is done
more for shown than for deterrence of

. Bartle stated that in 1993,
Duke University studied the costs of
executing prisoners versus the cost of
life imprisonment. The study showed
that the cost ofexecution exceeds the
cost of non-death prisoners by over $2
million. About 70 percent of the
population claim that they are in favor
of the death penalty. But those who
oppose it often feel very strongly about
it. Lisa Bartle's lecture pro
vided a forum for the information con
cerning this difficult issue to be aired
and discussed.

Marching to the Bullet beat

bySamHeriey Contributing Writer
Make no mistake about it;
the Collegiate Marching Band
Festival held in Allentown last
Sunday was only for entertain
ment purposes.
"There's no score. This is
not a competition; this is an ex
hibition," band director John
"Buzz" Jones said.
Be that as it may, the
Gettysburg College "Bullet"
Marching Band, the only Divi¬

sion III band out of the 10 per
forming schools at the Festival,
managed nothing less than a
strong showing, Jones said.
"The band did very well,
and I was pleased with the stu
dent leadership," he commented.
A crowd of more than
5,000 people was in Allentown
to observe the "Bullet" Band
give its first exhibition in over a
decade. The band was one of five
at the Festival which performed
to the music of legendary com
poser John Williams.

The student-led "Bullet"
Band, with its theme entitled
"Great Moments in Cinema: A
Tribute to John Williams," did
pieces from films such as Star
Wars, E.T., FarandAway, Raid
ers of the Lost Ark and Empire
of the Sun.
Past field show themes in
clude a medley of songs from the
hit Broadway musical Les
Miserables and songs from the
American Old West.
The other bands perform
ing in the Festival were
Kutztown University, California
University of Pennsylvania,
Shippensburg University, Bos
ton University, Morgan State
University, Indiana University of
Pennsylvania, the University of
Delaware, Penn State University
(with its famous Blue Band), and
West Chester University.
Each band performed for
10 to 20 minutes.
The Festival was "totally
awesome," according to junior

band member Erica Strang.
"It was neat seeing the other
bands' interpretation of the music.
And I got to talk with members of
other schools' bands."
Junior T.J.Scott agrees. "See
ing the [Penn State] Blue Band was
amazing. It was really interesting
seeing other bands performing."
The idea for the theme, which
proved popular with the band mem-

efforts to this point," Jones said.
The band is continually add
ing new details to its performances
and had to know between 60 and
70 drill sets for the festival in
Allentown.
"That's really a lot of
moves," Jones said.
Even so, "I personally like
it [the field show]," said Strang.
"It makes it so much more inter-

getting back up, which is good."
Strang is a theater major
with a music minor. Scott is a his
tory major.
The band consists of all
kinds. "The band's grown from
about 50 to 80 members in the last
five years, so it's been a nice,
steady growth," Jones said.
The music department finds

Band members work hard to create the field show seen at the football games. They rehearse
every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 4:15 to 5:30.

bers, all began with one of the
band's student leaders, junior Drum
Major Brian Ritter.
"He played the tape for me,
and we agreed that it would be our
1997 production," Jones said.
"The music is really a crowd
pleaser_," according to Scott. "I've
heard great comments about it."
Although there is always
room for improvement, the band has
made great strides since it first held
a three-day camp prior to orienta
tion in August, Jones said.
"After a month of doing it, I
think we can be really proud of our

esting than just standing on the
field playing. When we do it right,
it looks great."
"I love making pictures to
music," she added.
According to Scott, this
year's field show is "one of the best
ones I've been in."
The "Bullet" Band, cur
rently standing with 80 members,
is having one of its largest years
ever in terms of participation. Of
the members, about 15 to 20 per
cent are music majors.
"It was down to 10 or 11
percent for a while, but now it's

band members from looking at the
transcripts of the incoming fresh
men, sending out interest forms,
and word of mouth.
Some band members may
have joined simply because their
friends talked them into it.
Strang had been in march
ing band throughout high school,
and joining the "Bullet" Band was
simply the next logical step.
"I always knew I'd be in the
marching band," she stated.
Every member is in the
band simply because of a love for
music or performance, but Jones

and others are hoping to find a way
for them to get more from their
efforts.
"We're working very hard to
see that these individuals will be
able to earn credit. It's been one
of those long, drawn-out issues
that we're still working on," Jones
said. The band, which performs at
all the home football games, is the
only marching band in the Centen
nial Conference.
The band is hoping that up
coming events such as Parent's
Weekend, Homecoming and an
away game at Lebanon Valley in
November will be as successful as
the Festival in Allentown.
"I think that what is so im
portant for the students is that
they're getting extra support from
the campus. There's a certain pride
as to the way they carry them
selves; when they get support, it's
a real boost," Jones said.

There is a strong bond tying
the band together. "As the semes
ter goes on," said Strang, "the band
becomes more and more bonded.
There's a lot of unity. A stab at
one section [of the band] is a stab
at the whole band."
"It's a family," Scott as
serted. "Theie_'s great leadership.
Brian Ritter is amazing. And band
has really enhanced my college
experience. It's my relaxation."
Some might wonde* at
consdering having to learn 60 or
70 moves, and a number of musi
cal pieces as well, relaxation.
Scott explained that while she's
playing, she forgets about her
school work and can simply con
centrate on the music.
"It's an escape," Scott said.
Even with all the upcoming
events, the Collegiate Marching
Band Festival will no doubt re¬

main special to the Bullet Band.
Being able to perform in such an
event is a rare opportunity, and al
ready the "Bullet" Band is look
ing forward to returning next year.
"The band really enjoyed it.
We anticipate doing it again, as
long as it's not a conflict with
home football games," Jones said.

Cookies,wiener dogs, and nuclear physics

byCaraMasucci
Contributing Writer
Okay, let's face it. Who
does not have an image in their
brain of what a physics professor
should look like? I have one; or,
actually, I had one until I met Pro
fessor Sharon Stephenson, one of
the latest additions to the
Gettysburg College community.
When I met with
Stephenson, my first thought was
how easy-going and relaxed she
was. In the background I heard
some really cool music playing,
and as I glanced up at the wall, I
noticed an x-ray of a very small
animal.
I then learned that it was an
x-ray of Bart, her pet dachshund.
She even has a picture of him on
her web page. The page was pretty

interesting, and I highly recom
mend checking it out. The stu
dents in her lab have been lucky
enough to have been graced
with Bart's presence this past
week in one of their classes.
She even has a "dog people"
address book. How can you be
intimidated by that?
Stephenson might be so
relaxed and easy-going be
cause, like so many on campus,
she is new this year. After com
pleting her undergraduate work
at Millsaps College, a small lib
eral arts college in the South
that is much like Gettysburg,
and completing her Ph.D. at
North Carolina State in nuclear
physics, she went back to her
undergrad alma mater and
taught for a short while. She

then decided to make the move
to Gettysburg.
Upon questioning h er
about her reasons for coming to
Gettysburg College, I learned
that she came here and sat down
for lunch with all the physics ma
jors. She thought they were
great, and she found the whole
idea of the small liberal arts col
lege to be something really spe
cial. Since she has been here,
Stephenson has found everything
to be really special. The faculty
and staff of the physics depart
ment have been "absolutely
fabulous." Everyone was really
helpful in getting her set up and
on board.
Outside of physics, she
had one really important thing to

say about the college: "The cookies
in the dining hall are excellent!"
She has also found the town and
battlefields to be very beautiful. In
fact, you can often find her running
out on the fields adjacent to the col
lege. Another thing that Stephenson
likes about Gettysburg is the diver
sity within such a small town. She
thinks that the Latino population of
fers an aspect to the diversity of
Gettysburg that most small towns
lack. The conversation soon turned
from the area to Stephenson's chosen
field: physics.
Physics has been a male-domi
nated field in the past, and many
women are now filling the void of a
consistent female perspective in the
sciences. As I learned, science is not
anything new to Stephenson.

Growing up, she was exposed
to all sorts of different scientific back
grounds, and it would only be fitting
that she would choose one of them.
Having asked about her influences,
and who she felt had influenced her
the most, she spoke about her family.
A long line of scientists, including her
mother and aunt, had an influence that
is now easy to point to.
It would be nothing odd for
Stephenson to be a woman in a man's
world. In fact, the only discrimina
tion she has received for being a
woman has been from older profes
sors who were not brought up with
the notion of a woman as their equal.
Everyone else treats her as their equal.
Stephenson likes physics be
cause of all the concepts and infor
mation made readily available to an
individual, if they choose to look at it
in depth.
She also expressed an interest
in physics because "it kicked my
butt!" "When I finished, it was such a
rush!" According to Stephenson,
physics is like philosophy, and she
found that idea exciting. And that is
why she changed her major from En
glish to physics.
As her time here increases,
Stephenson hopes to get more into her
concentration of nuclear physics. She
will be giving talks on her disserta
tion, and next semester hopes for an
opportunity to teach a first year semi
nar about the role women have-had in
the sciences throughout time. Cer
tainly, this is a seminar fit for Profes
sor Stephenson to teach!

Dorothy Day is best remembered for her
work with the poor and as an outspoken
critic of social injustice. She was named
one of the honorees of National
Women's History Month in March of
1997, and November 8 marks her
centennial.

Staff Writer

Realism : as the word im
plies, this is the accurate represen
tation of real life as it occurs every
day "Magic realism" : applies
to the incorporation of fantastic or
mythical elements matter-of-factly
into otherwise realistic fiction
Presentational: elements of
the play may oppose what happens
in real life; i.e., some characters
may address speeches directly to
the audience, walls are see
through, the use of slides and
screens, etc.
In other news, one-act audi
tions will be held in the Green
Room (in the basement) of Brua
Hall on Wednesday, October 8, and
Thursday, October 9, from 3:30-6
p.m. The productions will be stu
dent directed, and range from a va
riety of styles, both comic and dra
matic. A wide selection of play
wrights will also be represented,
for a total of eleven different plays
in total. No prior acting experience
is necessary.
As a side-note, Professor
Emile Schmidt is still looking for
blue-grass musicians to play for the
winter musical, Cotton Patch Gos
pel . If you play, or know some
one who plays, that kind of music,
contact Professor Schmidt at the
theater.

StaffWriter Howard Bracken's life was
perfect. He had the perfect job in
a perfect little American town and
was engaged to the perfect
woman. His life simply couldn't
get any better - so it got worse.
As soon as the two simple
words "he's gay" were uttered
over national TV waves by
Howard's former student and now
Oscar winner Cameron Drake,
played well by Matt Dillon (The
Outsiders, Drugstore Cowboy ,
Singles), Howard's life was turned
upside down, and small-town
America suddenly became a Hol
lywood media circus.
With its mission clearly set,
In & Out plunges forward and at
tempts to tackle one of societies
most complex issuesrhomosexu
ality.

In the tradition of a previ
ous "Seinfeld" episode involving
homosexuality, in which the
phrase: "not that there's anything
wrong with that!" was repeatedly
being thrown at the audiences, In
& Out uses comedy to dilute and
deal with one of America's more
uncomfortable and volatile topics.
All the characters of In &
Out work very nicely together, as
a good cast should, to deliver the
difficult themes that are inherent
to the plot of this movie.
Howard Brackett, played by
Kevin Kline (Dave, A Fish Called
Wanda, Fierce Creatures, French
Kiss) is the perfect small town
high school teacher whose kind
manner make him popular on all
levels of the community. Despite
how well he is liked, though, In &
Out presents a sad facet of reality
in that, for most of the movie,
much the town of Greenleaf
judges Brackett negatively be
cause of the possibility that he
might be gay.

What In & Out really tries
to get at is the role of these atti
tudes regarding gays in all walks
of life - especially those that put
them in contact with kids.
Another crucial part of the
plot is the melodramatic news an
chor Peter Malloy, played per
fectly by Tom Selleck (Magnum
P.I. ). As part of the media on
slaught that besieges Greenleaf
after Cameron's infamous an
nouncement, Malloy is instrumen
tal in making this movie what it
is. Through his comic portrayal

of a self-admittedly sleazy Holly
wood reporter who is, in fact, a ho
mosexual, Malloy helps Brackett
figure out who he really is.
Brackett's only refuge as he
sees it, is represented by his fian
cee, the emotionally fragile Emily
Montgomery, played by Joan
Cusack (Grosse Pointe Blank).
Perhaps more distressed than any
one at the prospect that her fian
cee of three years may be gay,
Emily's character offers much of
the mild comedy that audiences
will find in In & Out.

While it is fairly clear that
In & Out is supposed to be funny,
the comedy proved to be a little
inconsistent. When it was present,
it was purely situational and fairly
uncreative.
Although there were a few
very funny scenes in In & Out
(such as the scene in which
Brackett is listening to a mascu
linity tape), much of this movie's
appeal will come with its honor
able mission and uplifting conclu
sion in which the town of
Greenleaf rallies in a triumphant
display to Brackett's side.

Even with the sometimes
drastic transitions from comedy to
heavy drama, In & Out must be
given points for keeping audiences
hanging with the question that is
on everybody's mind: "Is he gay?"
In & Out works mostly
through Greenleaf's locals but re
ally delivers a final, powerful mes
sage through super-star Cameron
Drake. In his fictional Oscar win
ning role, Drake plays a gay sol
dier who, though he excelled in the
military, is discharged from the
service because of his homosexual
preferences.
Some great parallels are
drawn between Cameron's fic
tional story, in which he delivers
a cheesy message, and Brackett's
real story, in which Cameron de
livers a real message.
Director Frank Oz (House
Sitter, What About Bob? ) takes on
a real challenge of approaching
one of society's toughest issues
armed only with light comedy and
solid characters.

Despite this substantial
goal, In & Out was, for the most
part, an entertaining, more "cute"
than extremely funny, movie that
harbors an encouraging outlook
on the issues it tries to tackle
through its fairly captivating
storyline.

treacherous ways of killing him

Simultaneously, he must en

The film is quite creative
with many humorous moments. A
couple of my favorites include the
math teacher with his comments
everyone loves, but no one can un
derstand. Also, keep your eye on
that advanced animation. Seeing

two hamburgers in love, just does
it for me.
The film is amusing, but in
order to appreciate it, the viewer
must be a child of the 80's. It does
provide such lines as "And dying
when you're not really sick is re
ally sick, you know. Really!"
"Gee, I'm real sorry your mom
blew up, Ricky." and the skiing
advice "Go that way. Really fast.

turn." Anyone who enjoys this
movie immensely will be happy
to know there is a web page
strictly devoted to the film. It's at
www.siue.edu/~jpuscze/bod.html.

From the very start of the
opening credits, audience mem
bers will know they are in for a
8O_'s flick. The lines, the colors,
the music could come from no
other decade. Directed and writ
ten by Savage Steve Holland, Bet

Editor's Note
In the past few weeks, there have been numerous problems with Focus. This is a combination of errors on my part and errors on the printer's part. For all the problems, I
sincerely apologize.

Dear Casey...

Dear Casey,
I am finding that I am fall
ing behind in my classes and that
my grades are beginning to slip.
My work load has increased a lot,
and it is getting harder and
harder to concentrate on my
studies because I get so frus
trated that I am behind. This
problem is only aggravated by the
constant interruptions from
phone calls and people just stop
ping by to visit. I sally don't
want to fail out. Do you have any
advice?
Thanks,
Slipping in the Grade-Yard
Dear Slipping in the Grade
Yard.

Indeed, the main focus of
college is obtaining an education,
although this goal is difficult to
accomplish if you are giving your
self an ulcer over school work.
Ulcers are as about as conducive
to a learning environment as drive
by shootings are. I highly suggest
you don't let things get that bad.
In order to alleviate your
stress, let me start by telling you
that it is nearly impossible to read
every single word of every single
book that every class assigns. In
order to do this, you would have
to cut yourself off from all social
activity. Ostracizing yourself from
social activity is not very produc
tive, now is it?

What it sounds like you
need to do is structure your time a
little more carefully, and watch out
for opportunities to get a little
reading in. The key to being more
productive and less frustrated in

college is to do your work in man
ageable segments.
Sometimes being in a col
lege environment it is hard to con
centrate, especially when all your
friends are going to LD's for late
night coffee, and you're still pour
ing over 300 pages of Women's
History. Regardless of how inter
esting the material, you would still
rather be doing something else.
Maybe instead of studying
in your dorm, study in a little nook
in the library, or in the Junction,
or anywhere where you will not
be distracted.
Lastly, don't worry about
what you're missing socially, or
for not being available for your
friends. Trust me, if it is impor
tant, they will find you. If not,
you'll be sure to hear about it later.
Best of luck in avoiding a tomb
stone in the grade-yard!

Dear Casey,
My boyfriend, whom I
have been dating for almost a
year and a half, now lives in
Montana. He told me recently
that he thinks we should see
other people. He claims that
the distance thing is causing a
strain on our relationship, and
that even though he cans a lot
about me, he thinks it is only
fair that we not confine our
selves to an exclusive relation
ship. Fair? I don't think this
is fair. What do you think?
Sincerely,
Suffering from Unfair
ness

Dear Suffering from Unfair
ness, Believe it or not, no one ever
said life was fair, and if they did,
they were wrong. I think your
boyfriend makes a good point
about "confining ourselves to an
exclusive relationship." Even
though it seems unfair now, it
probably makes a lot of sense.
There is a quote that I think
is appropriate for your situation
that goes a little something like
this: "If you love something, set it
free. If it comes back to you, it is
yours to keep. If not, then it was
never meant to be."
If you have faith that your
relationship was strong to begin
with, then time and distance will
not necessarily have a detrimen
tal effect on it. This time apart can
not only allow him to test the wa
ter, but also give you time to do
the same.

Don't burn bridges, because
sometimes they can never be re
built. Don't go looking for guys
with a vengeance. Respect your
boyfriend's decision. He seems to
be looking out for your best inter
est, and I am certain this was not
an easy decision for him to come
to. Think of it this way, he
could have lied to you. Instead,
he was straightforward and hon
est. I think he deserves a lot of
credit. So do not sit around and
mope, get out your party shoes and
have a good time. The world is
awaiting! Good luck.

This Side of Cynicism

A Few Words About Student Senate

bylanlscher wood
StaffWriter As of recent, the attack has
resumed on the Student Senate
which has become (at least in the
press), a common direction for dis
dain on this campus. I serve and
have served as a senator and, I
must confess, that such attacks are
not without warrant. Senate's role
last year in student affairs was
rather minimal, and the few items
which we discussed were not en
tirely adequate. I served through
my first term very frustrated with
the slow pace of senate operations
often to the point of constant criti
cism for the organization which I
was an elected member.
Oftentimes, our debates were
trivial, such as the assigned seat
ing issue last spring, but the abuse
in which we currently are meeting
has caused an influx of enthusiasm
through the Senate.

At the end of last semester,
Senate realized that reforms were
needed so that we could be a more
united and strong body for the ben
efit of student affairs, and work as
the liaison of such affairs to the
administration. Now, I am not
writing on behalf of Senate, nor am
I being an apologist for "the sys
tem" (what is this imaginary "sys
tem" which we all blame any
way?), I am simply writing of the
recent events and of the future of
our central governing body on
campus. Such a need for Senate

reform has caused a new style of
meetings based upon efficiency.
The introduction of club meetings
has caused senators to better un
derstand the many organizations
we sponsor. The advantage of our
monthly closed meetings is that
they give Senate more time to
gether as a whole body to debate
and discuss legislation without in
terference or overburdening for
mality. This is in my opinion, a
very fair style of meetings to com
bat the inefficiency of the Student
Senate.

The common misconception
about senate is that we are a gov
erning body of accountants who
are only used for handing out
checks to organizations on field

trips. Granted, most of our time is
eaten up by finance, but we are
much more than that in ideal. To
be perfectly honest, my primary
concern as a senator is not one of
finance. If I wanted to hand out
checks I would work for the Penn
sylvania lottery (which is a hor
rible institution of degradation, but
I will talk about that in another
column). We are not elected for
our financial genius, I know I
wasn't appointed for that, but
rather, because of my leadership
and sense of judgement. So why
then, is Senate held in such low
regard? Well, because of several
years of only serving as a student
budget board for activities. Oh
yeah, there is that twenty-four hour
library thing which is very appre
ciated, but what will Senate do in
the future?

If anyone attended the Sen
ate meeting this past Monday, they
would know that we have a very
different Senate this year as op
posed to senate in years past. The
Senate chamber was an open fo
rum of debate, and for the first
time, I as well as many other sena
tors, were excited to be represen
tatives. The primary concern of
senate is to represent the public and
such a concern was evident
through our differences and debat
ing. Senate has thus become in one
short month, an enthusiastic forum
of ideas, and by such ideas, effec
tive debate and diversity is accom
plished. My complaint is that now
Senate has unified itself behind the

banner of efficiency, but still the
oftentimes unfair attacks come
from all sides. How strong is our
Senate if all the public does is just
sit, complain, and whine about it?
If students want change, then
please, call our officers and com
mittee heads and present before the
whole body. Call a class senator
who will champion your cause.
Just don't sit around and complain
that senate is a joke. We have a
very different Senate this year
which makes me proud, and has a
great bit of potential. I just hope
that such potential is not killed by
apathy. There is that word again
which hurts the ears of our cam
pus community. It seems around
this time every year our campus

catches the apathy bug, or scien
tifically lameus apatheticus, which
is certainly not the fault of the Sen
ate. I have written twice now on
the constituent responsibility
theme and I am tired of it. Check
out the board in the CUB and look
up your representatives, and if you
don't, then please keep your mouth
shut because it makes even this
cynic sick to hear such unjust rub
bish. We have a progressive Sen
ate which wants to work (and we
are trying), but we need help from
the people we represent. Look for
Senate Works week in the CUB
where we'll have a table staffed by
senators taking complaints and
concerns. Check your e-mail for
senators writing about their goals
and view of senate as a whole. The

most important senate meeting this
year will be an open forum later
this month to listen to your voices
so that we can effectively write and
pass legislative opinions concern
ing the student body. Senate is
only effective as those in which we
represent. Keep that in mind.
Today is another town meet
ing which I hope is more than just
a yalping and yelling session like
last year. I just hope that our voices
will be listened to and not merely
heard. There is much disdain on
this campus and it appears that the

administrators have their hands
tied behind their backs. Last year
the town meetings seemed like a
very good idea on the outlook, but
in my opinion, they were just used
for public relations. It looked like
communication was improving,
and it looked as though the admin
istration was listening to the cam
pus community. We commonly
see our suggestions neglected, or
just forgotten over time. I want the
administrators this year to prove
my disdain wrong. I am begging
President Haaland to make me eat

my cynical words. I hope that the
opinions expressed are seriously
considered or examined so that
Gettysburg may be a more enjoy
able place to live. In all probabil
ity though, such thoughts are
merely idealistic _cliches. Rather, I
am tired of begging for progress,
it is time for some actual work to
be done from all sides.

by Kevin Howard and Erin
Patterson Public Relations Chairs -IFC and
Panhel Ladies and gentlemen wel
come to Greek Week! We have
some exciting news to report to
you today. Yesterday, at the Greek
Week carnival, we introduced for
the first time the King and Queen
of Greek Week. Enough suspense,
the more than qualified winners
were Abigail Rodgers from Delta
Gamma and Andrew McAllister
from Theta Chi. Congratulations
for being the role models of the
Greek campus for 1997 - 1998.

Abby has held many posi
tions within her chapter as well
within the Greek community. She
has been the Panhel Chief Justice,
Vice President Rush, and Vice
President Management. She was
also the undergraduate Interfrater
nity Institute intern and the Greek
life intern. On campus she is ac
tively involved as Student Senate
President and has also held the
position of Secretary, and Vice
President within Senate. Abby has
been on the Project Lead steering
committee for three years, the Co
director of the Women's Center, a
member of the President's Com¬

mission on Women and a member
of the Student Life Council. As
well as all of these accomplish
ments on campus she has received
many awards to solidify her posi
tion as Queen of Greek Week. She
has received the Outstanding So
rority Sophomore award, United
States Student Government Award,
Outstanding Residence Hall Vice
President and the Alfred J. Hamme
Award. She has clearly proven
herself as an extremely valuable
asset not only to her organization
but to the entire campus as well.
Andy has held executive
positions within Theta Chi such as
Secretary his sophomore__year and
is currently finishing out his term
as President. As President he has
helped guide his chapter through
the changing times of this campus

and the B YOB policy. Aside from
his accomplishments within his
chapter, he has also offered his ser
vice to the National Park Service
by helping to clean the 20th Maine
monument area on the battlefields.
His philanthropy work doesn't stop
there. He has also helped raise
$ 1300 for Theta Chi to be donated
to the Wee Care Day Care Center.
He and his chapter have been very
active with Load-ins at many of the
concerts and has participated in the
Greek Leadership Series with John
Regentin and the Sophomore
Leadership Series with Tom
Dombrowski. As far as awards,
Andy has received the Outstand
ing Sophomore Award in 1996,
Ritual Certification - Theta Chi
National Convention and comple
tion of the Sophomore Leadership
Series-. Andy has been a great ex
ample of an exemplary represen
tative for the King of Greek Week.
Congratulations to Abby and Andy
on a job well done and for being
great models for the Greek com
munity.

In other Greek related news,
Sigma Nu took time out of their
schedules on Sunday, September
29 to help clean up after the Mi
grant Worker Fiesta which was

Letters to the Editor

"Townie " Understands...

To The Editor,
I recently read a commen
tary in the Gettysburgian entitled,
"Welcome back . .. most of you".
I am also a Gettysburg resident. I
cannot speak to the frustration
which that resident obviously
feels. However, I might offer the
following words on the subject.
I know all too well the "sour
taste" a few "bad apples" can leave
since working with gang members
as a volunteer in a Texas juvenile
probation center for a couple of
years. However, to focus on a few
thoughtless students, would be to
ignore the many dedicated and
well-adjusted young men and
women here as college students
who take their futures and their so
cial responsibilities seriously.

I'm not saying that problems
don't exist. They do. However,
as "townies", let's try to under
stand and remember that we were
there once. It's an age that moves

most through adolescence to adult
hood, from insecurity to confi
dence, from contemptuousness to
an understanding that "we're all in
this together." There will doubt
less always be those who can't
quite make these transitions in life,
but from what I've seen here from
my view of the campus, they are
proportionately few. To those few
who throw the beer cans and cups,
disturb our sleep at 2 AM, cut
down our trees, speed and smoke
your tires on our streets, etc., etc.,
it wouldn't do any good to address
you anyway.
To the majority of students
who are on a higher level of
thought however, and who accept
responsibility for their actions,
thanks for being here with us in
Gettysburg. We do appreciate you.
Kindly,
Mike Sanni

I've met Jesse
Helms, and you're
No Jesse Helms...
To The Editor,
I would first like to begin by
congratulating Matt Brown, on his
From the Donkey's Mouth column.
The column was weil written and
made many interesting points,
however, most I tended to disagree
with. One line that very much dis
turbed me though was the line,
"Mr. Helms a known racist." I
have met Jesse Helms, and I have
a friend who works for the Senior
Senator from North Carolina, and
I can assure you that the Chairman
of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee is not a racist.

It is sad that such a despi
cable work has to be thrown
around so much. I have been
called a racist before, why, because
of my conservative beliefs. I am
not. Mr. Brown, if you would like
to find some racist, then you
should look to your own party and
Senator dictator who is a former
member of the Ku Klux Klan or
the Reverend Jesse Jackson, a pos
sible anti-Semite, who called New
York, "Hymie Town," because of
its Jewish population.
It is an insult to the people
of North Carolina to say they
would elect a know racist. My
roommate when I served as a Page

in the United States Capitol is an
African-American from the state
of New Jersey, who while holding
moderate to liberal beliefs came to
respect and enjoy one of the nic
est men in United States Senate,
the Honorable Jesse Helms. Lib
erals do not like Jesse Helms be
cause he stands up for what he be
lieves, something that both politi
cal parties need more of. Let's
save that terrible word, racist, for
the people in our society who truly
need toe shunned. If the word is
nothing more than a political at
tack, then it loses its meaning. I
think we can disagree without be
ing so disagreeable and mean spir
ited. Sincerely,
John Dunlap, '00

Consider this

Over the past few weekends,
t seems that there have been more
md more groups out wandering
he sidewalks of Gettysburg. In the
>ast, these groups have always
>een walking somewhere. Now,
hey're just walking.
The time will come in the
lot-too-distant future when the
ludents of Gettysburg will run out
_>f things to do.
As bad as they may have
_>een, fraternity parties provided a
nuch-needed outlet for the cam
)us. They gave students some
hing to do on the weekend.
This year, fraternities are
nore reluctant to have parties.
Vhen they get fined for something
is minor as using the wrong kind
)f holepunch for the "drink cards,"
t is easy to see why there are fewer
mrties this year.

Some may see this as a good
hing. However, this cut-back on
)arties has had very detrimental
:ffects on the college community.
As great as the SAC spon
sored events are on the weekend,
here is no way that the whole col
ege can fit into the Junction, or
sven the Ballroom.
And people determined to
irink will drink.
The crime stats of recent
veeks have shown an increase in
he busting of parties in dorms and

off-campus apartments. Instead of
partying at fraternities, people are
now partying in their rooms.
This week, a resident of Get
tysburg was shot with a BB gun
by an intoxicated college student.
There is no way to prove that
these are the events of fewer orga
nized parties. But it is doubtful
that they would have happened if
the students involved had been in
a fraternity house those nights.
When bored, students have
very little to occupy their minds.
The tiniest thing can set a drunk
person off.
This kind of attitude has led
to anti-homosexual graffiti around
campus. While many do not think
homophobia is a problem on cam
pus, this kind of act shows how
biases come out when the mind is
idle. The next few weekends look
fairly safe. This weekend is Fam
ily Weekend. Next weekend is
Reading Days.

But what then? There's a
long gap between Reading Days
and Thanksgiving. People are
bound to get desperate for some
thing to do.
Is this the fault of the admin
istration, or the fault of the stu
dents? Both. And it's up to both to
come up with a solution.

Random searches, an insult
to integrity...

To The Editor,
This week, Safety and Secu
rity is "randomly" searching dorm
rooms throughout most of the cam
pus. The searches will be unan
nounced, and if the residents are
not in the room, the security offic
ers will enter the room by them
selves. I was told the officers
would do a brief walk through of
the room and take notice of "ille
gal" objects or safety violations if
any. They will not open closets or
pry through personal possessions.
I am offended the college is tak
ing the liberty to search rooms.
For myself, random security
checks are degrading, disrespect
ful, and most of all, a violation of
my private space. Essentially, I
pay a rent for my room. I have
signed residential contracts and
have abided by all general rules. I
have nothing to hide, and I have
done nothing wrong. I am assum
ing that several incidents in dorm

rooms are prompting this check. I
am not against the rules, however,
I do think the one and only circum
stance a security officer should
check a room, is with probable
cause. I think it is the responsibil
ity of the Residential Assistants
and Residential Coordinators to be
familiar with the type of traffic go
ing in and out of rooms, and with
suspicions of illegal activity, a se
curity check is understandable.
Again, I have done nothing wrong.
Being searched because of others'
shortcomings is offensive. It is my
natural right to have freedom of
privacy regardless if my residence
is on public or private grounds.
Gettysburg College is violating a
principle of integrity, which as an
institution itself promotes integrity
through the Honor Code. Does the
college have the right to do this?
Probably, but I am questioning my
level of respect in the administra
tive services.

The Pachyderm's Pulpit

Stomping on the Democrat s Party

_byJohnDunlap
Staff Writer Politics may be the most
ironic part of life. Today, the Na
tional Democrat Party, in an attempt
to save itself, has become an imita
tion of the Republican Party, a kind
of Republican light. From 1972
with left-wing Senator George
McGovern's victory for the Demo
cratic Nomination until Governor
Bill Clinton's victory for his party's
nod in 1992, Democrats showed
their true colors by nominating
unelectable liberals with the excep
tion of President Jimmy Carter, who
was a product of the anti-Washing
ton Watergate period.
After losing in landslide
losses in 1972 and in 1984 with
Jimmy Carter's Vice President
Walter Mondale, and being defeated
once again in 1988 with liberal
Massachusetts Governor, Michael
Dukakis, Democrats decided to imi
tate the GOP. Former President
Ronald Reagan has called the
Democrat's attempt at imitation, the
most sincerest form of flattery.

Only by pretending to be me-too
conservatives will Democrats out
side urban America be able to win,
and the Republican stance on crime
has been working in New York City
with Mayor Pudy Guilliani.
Whenever Americans have a
choice between a liberal and a con
servative, the conservative almost
always wins. Only when Demo
crats cloud the issues with negative
attacks like President Clinton and
the liberal unions did in 1996 can
they survive.
For forty years Democrats
controlled Congress, the liberal
leadership was even able to survive
the Reagan era. With the election
of a Democrat President in 1992,
who governed as a liberal his first
two years, with the largest tax in
crease in American history and an
attempt at national socialized medi
cine did Democrats have to show
their true colors. No longer could
Congressional pork and catering to
local issues work, they moved to the
left and they were defeated.
American politics were al
tered in 1994, we no longer had Re
publican Presidents and a Demo¬

cratic Congress; we now had the re
versal, but this time, the GOP was
in control, not the Democrat Presi
dent. To save his political life, Bill
Clinton slithered down the ideologi
cal scale _^ moving towards Newt
Gingrich and Congressional Repub
licans on balancing the budget and
welfare reform.
The biggest irony in politics
today is that while the Democrats
are desperately attempting to be
come Republicans, Democrats are
calling Republicans extremist. Is it
extreme to balance the budget, is it
extreme to cut taxes on capital gains
to spur the creation of new jobs, is
itextreme to reform Medicare, so it
can be saved and not allowed to
wallow and die, and is it extreme to
reform welfare? At one time or an
other President Clinton with the use
of foreign campaign contributions
said all of these things were ex
treme, but guess what he gave in ev
ery time to a Republican Congress,
who believed in something that is
unusual in Washington, called com
mon sense.
Democrats in 1964 called the
Republican Presidential Nominee

Barry Goldwater an extremist, but
today the ideas that he exposed are
being implemented by, who of all
people, a Democrat President. Lib
eral historians like to say that
Goldwater and McGovern both rep
resented the extremes in their re
spective parties, but while George
McGovern's agenda has been
thrown in the ash-heap of history,
Ronald Reagan swept into office on
the Goldwater platform, and back
in 1980, they called Reagan an ex
tremist. Ronald Reagan was cer
tainly not extreme, he brought con¬

servatism to the main stream. He
restored our economy and won the
Cold War, when liberals declared
that he would cause World War III.
Like Goldwater and Reagan
before him, Democrats today are
playing their old extremism tune
again. It worked in the Presidential
race when Bill Clinton and Al Gore
ran the most negative reelection
campaign since Lyndon-Johnson's
'64 campaign. They failed in the
Congressional races as Republicans
were reelected for the first time in
68 years. If Newt Gingrich is so
extreme, then why does Bill Clinton

pathetically follow him and then
take credit for what the Republicans
in Congress do? We all know the
answer: conservatism has won. Jn
Great Britain, Labor Party Leader
Tony Blair became Prime Minister
on a "New Labor" platform, very
similar to Clinton's "New Demo
crat" themes. In France even the
Socialist Party moved right to win
and they did.
This does not mean liberal
ism is dead, and the conservative
victory is permanent, Bill Clinton
continues to appoint liberal judges,

and we most likely will never get a
flat tax with President Clinton
around. Through Washington's
bloated bureaucracy, Clinton and
company continue to show down
the Republican rise.
What Republicans need to do
is ignore the liberals and move for
ward. Make the case for a flat tax,
fight for regulatory and tort reform,
and stand up to the Clinton
Administration's liberal appointees.
No, liberals are not gone, they just
have to be a little sneaky about their
ways, and they have the right Presi
dent for that.

Brayings on Race and the Futuie

Kefly Davis
Staff Writer Last week President Clinton
attended the 40th Anniversary of
the desegregation of Central High
School in Little Rock, Arkansas.
The event marked the anniversary
of the entrance of nine black stu
dents into the all-white high
school. In an address made at the
high school, President Clinton
challenged the nation to continue
to work toward improved race re
lations within the country.
As part of this challenge,
President Clinton will attend the
second meeting of his advisory
board on racial issues this week.
The advisory board was created
this June by the Presidt at in order
to initiate national discussion of
race relations within the country.
To some, the actions of the Presi
dent seem to be too little too late,
and still to others, it appears to be
completely necessary. I personally

think of it as a step in the right di
rection.
We are at a point in our his
tory where things seemed to have
stagnated. Maintaining the status
quo is easier than working toward
improvement. During the 1960's,
there were glaring injustices in our
nation's racial policies. There ex
isted clear goals for reforms in race
relations. Today things are a little
more ambiguous. Many of the
current injustices are easy to con
ceal and, as a result, easier to ig
nore. An example of this is the
attack on affirmative action over
the last few years. Many believe
that affirmative action has served
its purpose and is no longer nec
essary in today's society. The in
justices and inequality have been
removed. That would be great if
only it were true. Minorities are
still denied the opportunity of pro
fessional advancement solely
based on the basis of race. It is
still difficult for many minorities

to obtain positions at the level of
top management.
Sadly we still live in a na
tion greatly divided along the lines
of race and ethnic origin. I would
bet that most of us who attended
racially diverse high schools can
relate to the common lunch room
scenario. The black students sat
with the other black students. The
Latino students sat with the other
Latino students. The white stu
dents sat with other white students.
This is not to say that this was
some steadfast law. In fact, this
situation was governed by no law
at all. Schools have become de
segregated by law, but they remain
segregated in reality.
Perhaps in comparison with
other countries the United States
race problems are minor. When we
look at the numerous countries
currently engaged in civil wars and
forms of ethnic cleansing, our situ
ation looks especially rosy. But
maybe we are not that far away

from those scenarios. Of course I
am not saying that tomorrow a civil
war will break out, but occurrences
like those tend to start small and
grow over time.
I believe what is frightening
about today's current state of race
relations is that we are choosing
to separate ourselves on the basis
of race. No longer is there legisla
tion that separates us. Unfortu
nately no legislation can bring us
together. We have to do that our
selves.
President Clinton has chal
lenged us all to looked beyond our
own cloistered experiences and
view all that the people of our na
tion have to offer. It is often too
easy to stay within our safe, com
fortable existence. We associate
with people of the same race, reli
gion, and socioeconomic back
ground. Why is that? Because
it's easier. It takes an effort to make
a connection with those of other
cultures. Sadly it seems that we

are unwilling to make that effort.
Today we live in a world
where our schools are desegre
gated and the separate but equal
rhetoric has died. Still an appar
ent division exists. President
Clinton wants to initiate national
discussion of the topic of race re
lations. In his speech given at Cen
tral High School, the President
stated that discrimination still ex
ists in America and the gains the
nine students had helped achieve
40 years ago were being threatened
by reemerging, racially divisive
attitudes.
In many ways this attitude
will be much more difficult to
overcome than the injustices of the
sixties because this change will
have to come from within each citi
zen. Our government cannot force
us to come together. We have to
do that ourselves. President
Clinton can only begin the discus
sion. Now we have to engage in
it.

Rugby goes to the
wire with rival F&M

ByMattEisenberg Contributing Writer
On Saturday, September
27, The men's rugby team "took
to the pitch" versus arch-rival
Franklin and Marshall. The last
time these teams rumbled the af
tershock was felt as far away as
Saskatchewan, Canada. The game
ended in a tie last Saturday, but
neither team was satisfied and both
were out for blood.
The game was intense
from the start with hard hitting
from both sides. Gettysburg was
inside the Diplomats 22 meter line
for most of the first half. In the
tenth minute, the Bullets broke
through with a hard fought try by
senior forward Ben Graham. The
bullets made the extra kick and
were up 7-0.

The domination contin
ued, and with a penalty kick by
senior Ryan Bader the Bullets
were up 10-0. Bader led the team
on defense with thirty tackles. The
forwards dominated the line-outs
with help from senior fly-half
Brian "I need security" Johnson.
The Bullets showed tre
mendous heart during a five
minute stand behind their own 22
meter-line. They stopped the Dip
lomats dead with help from fresh
man standout Craig Wilson and

sophmore, back turned eightman,
Rob Ricah.
At the start of the second,
the Diplomats came out strong but
were unable to break through the
wings, sophomores Eric Aiello and
Chuck Weber. Dermot Nugent
also played exceptionally well for
his first game at fullback. The Dip
lomats finally broke through in the
fifteenth minute with a try of their
own. Another try was scored five
minutes after the first. "We played
hard, but we still need to work on
conditioning," said President Steve
Arcuri. The score was 12-10.
The Bullets picked up their game
but on this day it simply was not
enough. A bad decision late in the
game by senior Captain Matt
Eisenberg set the Bullets back be
hind their own 22 meter line and
there was not enough time left.

The Bullets played tough
throughout the match. "We'll just
have to pick up our level of play,"
stated Arcuri. He was confident,
though, that this Saturday the Bul
lets would be ready for
Susquehanna at home.
Susquehanna is coming
off a tough game against Bucknell
which ended in a tie, 5-5.
Susquehanna boasts a big pack, but
this sportswriter is optimistic that
the Bullets will make their parents
proud.

Hockey Highlights

from Gettysburg Piess Release
Gettysburg, PA~Three of
the top four scorers on the Gettys
burg College field hockey team are
sophomores.
Senior forward Becky
Griffith, Camp Hill (Cedar Cliff
H.S.), is the Bullets; leading scorer
after 10 games with eight goals and
a pair of assists. She accounted
for Gettysburg's lone goal in a 6-1
loss to Lebanon Valley that
dropped the Bullets' record to 5
5. Behind Griffith in the scor
ing column come three sopho
mores. Forward Steph Fisher,

Lewisburg (Lewisburg H.S.), is the
runner-up with six goals and an
assist. Tied for third place are for
ward Carolyn Anzalone,
Shavertown (Wyoming Seminary
H.S.), with two goals and
midfielder Laura DeSario, East
Setauket, N.Y. (Ward Melville
H.S.), with one goal and two as
sists. Anzalone contributed the
only goal in Gettysvurg's 1-0 vic
tory over Muhlenberg.
NOTE: The Bullets have
been outscored, 24-18, through
their first 10 games, proving that
they have had some hard fought
battles.

Bullets blast
Swarthmore. 64-15

Shooting high:

JoshEyler Assistant Sports Editor
The Gettysburg Bullets (1
1) absolutely, positively spanked
Swarthmore (0-2) last Saturday.
No doubt about it. The score was
64-15. One would think that with
a win like this the whole game
was a blowout. That person
would be wrong. As a matter of
fact, the score was tied 15-15 at
halftime.
Then, like bats out of hell,
the Bullets scored five times to
start the melee. Chris Lunardi
said, "They just didn't know what
hit'em."
It was definitely the Bullet
backfield's day in the sun. Matt
Helwig was named Centennial
Conference offensive player of
the week for his performance.
Helwig covered 149 yards on 10
carries. He scored three times
from eight, 45, and 24 yards, re
spectively.

The only guy to stop
Helwig on that day was a small
green land mammal resembling a
leprechaun. Sprinting toward the
endzone for an apparent touch
down, Matt was tripped up by the
green man, and stopped ten yards
shy of the endzone.
Paul Smith, who leads the
conference in all-purpose yards
with 609, rushed for 145 on Sat
urday and scored two times. Just
for reference, no little green men
got to Paul.
Two freshmen quarterbacks

led the helm for Gettysburg on
Saturday, and both played ex
tremely well.
Jeff Boyd ran for 90 yard
on seven carries, and Dennis
Flaherty threw his first collegiate
touchdown pass: an eleven yard
toss to junior Jeff Closz, who
scored twice in the game. Derek
Reed also scored for the Bullets.
The meager Swarthmore
offense managed to score only 15
points, all of which came in the
first half. Leading the Bullet bar
ricade was Jason Osborn. Osborn

was named to the Centennial
Conference Honor Roll for his
nine solo tackles and a 36 yard
scoring interception.
Both Rob Sena and Joe

Hodakowski also had interceptions. Rounding out the killing
machine were Tom Olchon, Kevin Gurski, Chad Mire, Gene
Kraus, Matt Ritz, Chris Felton, Justin Domingos, Scott Grabus,
and Brian Murphy.
This week, the Bullets try to keep that fire as third place
Johns Hopkins comes to town. Everyone is anxious to show the
Bluejays what Gettysburg is all about. As Matt Helwig says,
"We're gonna rock their world."

Women's Soccer on a nine
game winning streak

The Bullets Women's Soc
cer Team is still surging ahead by
adding three more strokes to the
win column this week. This puts
'their winning streak at nine games.
Last Wednesday, the Bullets
moved up to the second slot in the
Mid-Atlantic Region with a huge
win over the Blue Jays of
Elizabethtown. A first half goal
by Amy Brewster proved to be all
that the Bullets needed to slip by
the Blue Jays.
The Bullets' defense frus
trated the Jays all day with their
off-sides trap, preventing any scor
ing opportunities. Senior Goal
keeper and captain, Beth O'Boyle,
chalked up her fifth shutout of the
season with an outstanding perfor-

byFrankie Dauphin
Contributing Writer

mance.
The weekend was a bit of a
reliever for the Bullets, when they
beat Bryn Mawr 6-0. This con
ference win left them 3-0 in the
Centennial Conference and just
behind Johns Hopkins (due to
goals against).
Amy Brewster and Lauren
Frankford each netted two goals,
while Paula Connard and Lauren
Scott added one apiece. Patsy
Cors provided two assists and
O'Boyle now has six shutouts on
the season. After this game, Amy
Brewster was named to the Cen
tennial Conference Honor Roll for
her game winning goal against
Elizabethtown, and the two more
that she added against Bryn Mawr.

After these two games, the
Bullets moved from 19 to 11 in the
National Division III Rankings,
and from three to two in the Mid
Atlantic Region poll.
On Tuesday, the Bullets re
mained undefeated in the confer
ence with a win against
Swarthmore. However, the Bul
lets were tested once again when
the Crimson Tide took them into
overtime. Patsy Cors put the first
goal on the Scoreboard late in the
second half, but it wasn't enough
for the Tide's rally.
Regulation play ended in a
1-1 tie. The Bullets dominated
their opponent by pelting them
with 21 shots as compared to
Swarthmore's three. In the over
time period the Bullets were too
much for the Tide to handle.
The Swathmore goalkeeper
misplayed a long range shot by
Lauren Frankford 13:38 into the
overtime period to allow the Bul
lets to preserve their 4-0 record in
the conference.

The Bullets are now look
ing toward the week ahead of
them. They travel to Ursinus on
Saturday for their fifth conference
game, and return home on Sunday
to take on regional rival, Richard
Stockton. The Bullets are out to
seek revenge for the 3-1 loss that
they suffered at Stockton a year
ago. Kick off is at lpm.
The Bullets are also at home
on Wednesday, October 8, for yet
another conference battle against
the Green Terror of Western Mary
land.

Football Notes : Stepping up to play quarterback this
week will be freshmen Dennis Flaherty and Jeff Boyd. Both
have shown tremendous quickness and the ability to lead the
offense.
Intersting fact of the week-- while Halfback Matt Helwig
and Fullback Paul Smith play completely different positions
and have different running styles, they have "mirror image"
statistics.
Paul Smith has carried the ball 43 times for 324 yards;
averaging 108 yards per contest.
Matt Helwig has carried the ball 42 times for 324 yards;
averaging 108 yards per contest.

He shoots... He scores

The soccer playing fields at
Gettysburg College are a far cry
from the streets of Mexico- and no
one knows this better than senior
Greg Stevcic. Stevcic, Gettysburg
Men's Soccer Team captain, has a
background different from most
Gettysburg students.
Greg has quite an interna
tional history, as his mother,
Lilianna, is from Argentina and his
father, Jugo_, is from Yugoslavia.
Greg was born in Mexico, where
he lived until 1984 when he and
his family moved to Medford, New
Jersey.
Stevcic spent a good part of
his childhood learning the art of
soccer while playing in the Mexi
can streets. There Stevcic learned
his skills while practicing with
BoraMinutilovic, his father's good
friend, as well as the Mexican
World Cup Team's head coach.
Stevcic spend his weekends im
mersed in soccer-either watching
games or practicing with
Minutilovic's professional team.

Greg Stevcic is playing his final season of Bullets soccer, and he is going out
with a bang

byCheshaMiller
StaffWriter

Greg, an attacking center
midfielder played an integral role
on his high school team. He scored
the winning goals, both his junior
and senior years at Shawnee High
School, in the state championship
games. A true athlete at heart, he
spent his high school years as a
three season athlete, playing soc
cer, tennis and also swimming.
In 1994 Greg followed his
older brother, swimmer Jugo
Stevcic, to Gettysburg. Greg was
very happy to come to a Division
III school where he could continue
both his soccer and swimming ca
reers, as well as pursue his aca
demics.
At Gettysburg Stevcic is
able to dominate the soccer field

and unwind in the pool, an
experience he calls "huge".
Stevcic's favorite event in the
pool is the 200 meter Individual
Medley (50m of each butterfly,
breast, back and free strokes),
however, his main athletic focus
is always soccer. "I swim for
fun," explains Stevcic, "I love the
atmosphere of the team."
Coach Rawleigh and the
swimmers are great!"Stevcic has
played quite an impressive soccer
game for Gettysburg. During his
sophomore year Stevcic broke the
record for most goals in a season
(21). The following year he broke
the records for the most goals in a
career and for the most career
points, which are now 37 and 97,
respectively.
As a sophomore and junior
Stevcic was named to the first team
All-Centennial Conference, as
well as to the Regional Ail-Ameri
can team. This past weekend
Stevcic broke his fourth Gettys
burg soccer record, the most career

assists, for which he has 23.
For Stevcic soccer is a part
of him, it is, as he says, "in [his]
blood". Stevcic describes a cer
tain feeling that comes over him
when watching the game of soc
cer. He says, "my favorite part of
soccer is the times that I get so in
spired in a game that I feel I can
do anything. The result really can't
be explained in words." Much of
Stevcic's passion for the game has
come from his father, Jugo.
"He was the one who pushed
me and made me tough," explains
Stevcic, "he kept my head straight,
to be sure it never got too big, and
he taught me to never be satisfied
and to always look to be better."
Stevcic also has gained much of
his inspiration from Michael Jor
dan. "He drives me to do what I
do. I admire the way he handles
pressure, training, his confidence,
his theories, and his appearance on
and off the court," remarks Stevcic.
Gettysburg men's soccer
coach David Wright calls Stevcic
one of the best players he's ever

coached. "Greg is a very talented
player," says Coach Wright, "he
has vision and recognition of what
is happening as it happens in a
game." Stevcic is able to convey
what the team should do in situa
tions to his teammates while play
ing. In a game like soccer, which
has not timeouts, this is a very im
portant skill.
Coach Wright describes
Stevcic as a different type of soc
cer player, "he expects the most of
himself and his teammates at all
times on the soccer field, and he
also has a hard time accepting any
thing less than perfection."
According to Coach Wright,
"Greg's heritage allows him to ap
proach the game in a different light
than the typical American born and
based player." Stevcic believes this
year's squad to be the best team he
has been a part of here at Gettys
burg. He resolves that despite the
slow start of the season the team's
destiny is still in their own hands,
and one of his personal goals is to
advance past the first round of the

NCAA tournament.
For Greg Stevcic the most
important part of his experience
playing soccer is the memories he
has made. Athletics have been en
hanced for Stevcic because of his
teammates. "The best part about
playing a sport is being part of a
team," explains a smiling Stevcic,
"[is that] you spend most of your
day with them, and the relationship
you form is really hard to find else
where."
Stevcic has been very fortu
nate to have the expertise and opin
ions of both his swim coach,
Coach Rawleigh, and Coach

Wright. A strong mutual respect
exists between Stevcic and Coach
Wright. Each appreciate and un
derstand each other's passions, and
enjoy sharing their enthusiasm
with one another. Coach Rawleigh
is an important guide in Stevcic's
life. He thoroughly enjoys giving
"Greggie" a hard time, and going
nose-to-nose with him at times.
Both coaches greatly admire his
competitive drive and passion and
claim it is Greg's intensity and zest
for life which makes him an ex
ceptional athlete.

Coach Wright believes that
Stevcic has what it takes to become
a professional soccer player.
Stevcic himself hopes to accom
plish this. This summer he plans
to try-out with a few professional
teams in England, or possibly play
forMinutilovic in Mexico.
He is excited by the possi
bilities and options which are open
to him. After try-outs, or playing
professional soccer, the Interna
tional Management major/ Span
ish minor, hopes to open an inter
national cuisine restaurant with his
brother Jugo. Whatever it is that
Stevcic ends up doing, it will
surely be done with passion and
excitement.

SportsWeekly
They can run like the wind blows...

Because our Gettysburg
Cross Country runners are so very
fast, it took us a full month to catch
up to them for an article. Luckily
their captains Kris Weum, James
Smith, Wendy Johnston and Martie
Calello, stopped running just long
enough to recap the past three
weeks of the season; and my word,
they have been busy!!
The season opened with a
home meet against Messiah and
Juniata three weeks ago on Sep
tember 6th, and from the sound of
things they started the season with
a great big bang - both teams be
ing first place finishers!
The men's team brought a
new meaning to the phrase "PACK
IT UP" with their seven varsity
runners placing 2nd through 8th.
Leading the for Gettysurg was one
of our first year students, Jon
Cattlett, finishing the race in sec
ond place with a time of 26:59.

by Contributing Writers

Bob Condon, our head Cross
Country coach for both the men
and the women, said, "I was sur
prised to see Jon up in front and
didn't believe he was that fast." He

then went on to say, "Jon s speed
would just help the team, making
everyone else run that much
faster!"
Coach was absolutely right
because the next four finishers
were within 37 seconds of Jon's
finish: the two seniors taking third
and fourth place being Jason Smith
with a time of 27:12, and James
Smith with a time of 27:15; fol
lowed by two juniors Kris Weum
(27:20) and Brendon Clark
(27:35).
Finishing the varsity seven
off strong, only a minute and fif
teen seconds off of their leader,
junior George Torgun was in sev
enth place (27:40) and sophomore
Dave Gary was in eighth (28:15).
The pack of seven was both quick
and tight. In Condon's words, "a
coaches dream!"

However the excitement
doesn't end there because the new
batch of freshman are getting
stronger and tougher each day.
Weum, one of the two Men's Cap
tains explains, "the upcoming crop
of freshman are definitely a help
and an awesome asset to the

team!" "The only problem," coach
Condon states disappointedly, "is
that a fewof our key players didn't
do much in the way of training this
summer, which puts us behind the
eight ball." Meaning that it will
take the team to mid October be
fore they'll be at their most com
petitive. At that time, however,
with everyone running well, just
think of what a "pack" will exist
then. All in all, it was a wonderful
way for the men to start the sea
son. As for the women, they
weren't to shabby themselves!
Three seniors, Wendy Johnston,
Martie Calello, and Joyce O'Neil
lead the team to a victory over both
Messiah and Juniata. Johnston
was the first to cross the finish line

Kris Weum clashes through the mud, and is apparently
"breathing right."

with a time of 18.31. Calello was
quick to follow with a second place
finish of 19:02. O'Neil finished
up the trio with a time of 20:07.
The next three finishers
were all first year students: Kristen
Mills, Kim Heimerl, and Tracy
Swackhamer. They all ran strong
with terrific determination, clearly
helping the team out toward their
first victory. Christine
Santeusanio, our fourth senior,
closed up the top seven finishing
strong with a time of 21:35.
Condon commented on the
women's performances explain
ing, "this is a peak year for the
women, the Seniors take _'the first
three spots and the youngsters are
in a pack not too far behind." He
also adds, "I'd like to see the time
between the gap be worked on, yet

these women have the potential to
be a truly outstanding team by the
time of Championships!"
The next meet that our Bul
let Runners faced was the Leba
non Valley Invitational on Satur
day September 13. This is an ex
citing meet because it' * the first
time we run some of the teams that
will be in the regional competition.
Wendy Johnston had a superb rac
ing day. Not only did she win the
Invitational for the second con
secutive year, but she also took a
few seconds off her time.
Condon reports, "it was nice
to see Wendy win it again. She's
still improving with every season
she runs!" Wendy was the first
place winner out of 251 overall
runners! Martie Calello was the
next finisher for the team and
placed sixth overall with a time of
20.13, taking a minute and seven
seconds off her time last year.
Joyce O'Neil ran 25 with a time
of 21:15 and is getting stronger and
stronger with each race.

The freshman pack followed
the top three to the finish line run
ning hard and feeling strong. Kim
Heimerl, Kristen Mills, Kelly Lord
and Tracy Swackhamer finished
the race, placing 71, 83, one 106,
and 118; each girl improving their
times from high school drastically.
Condon comments, "the improve
ment on the women's team is out
standing!" The women placed
fourth out of 24 teams...definitely
a job Well Done!!
Not only were the women
fast, but the men were also faster
than speeding "Bullets." Jon
Cattlett ran tenth overall with a
time of 27:05 showing absolutely
no intimidation being a first year
student. He was closely followed
by James Smith in sixteenth place
running 27:26; and Kris Weum in
nineteenth place running 27:32.

The pack of Gettysburg run
ners did not end there. Dave Gary,
George Torgun, Alex Franyo, and
Jason Rose finished up the top
seven placing 36, 42, 90, and 92.
The men's team finished thirrd out
of 25 teams. Coach commented,
"the guys had an excellent running
