Hail to the chief

sororities

Eighty-eight women go through formal rush

The Greek System at
Gettysburg College has been un
dergoing a period of change. Dur
ing this year's Formal Rush, all of
the sororities witnessed some new

occurances.
Eighty-eight women went
through Formal Rush this year. All
88 were accepted as pledges to the
four sororities participating in
Rush. (Alpha Xi Delta followed a
different strategy to attract mem
bers this year.) This number was
considerably lower than in previ
ous years, especially considering
the large size of the First Year class.
According to Meaghan
Halpin, the vice president of this
year's rush, this has not occurred
at Gettysburg College in recent
times. Halpin gives credit for this
victory to the Rho Chis, or Rush
Counselors, who encouraged the
women not to "suicide" a sorority
by having a certain sorority be their
only choice. Most women had a
few first choices.

The 88 pledges were distrib
uted fairly evenly between the four
sororities. Alpha Delta Pi has 19
pledges, Chi Omega has 20, Delta
Gamma has 22, and Gamma Phi
Beta has 23.
The withdrawl of Alpha Xi
Delta from Formal Rush had an
effect the amount of women that
each sorority could accept.

Happy 21st Birthday Mark Astrom

Alpha Xi Delta has presently
accepted five new members with
theur new rush policy.
On the last day of Rush, there
is a certain number of members that
each sorority is allowed to take in,
called quota.
Quota is the number of Final
Rushees divided by the number of
sororities. Dividing the number by
four instead of five increased the
number of pledges in each sorority.
This year, the quota was 23
women per each of the four sorori
ties involved in formal rush. Last
year, the quota was larger. A 24
woman quota was given to five so
rorities.
Neither Halpin nor Pan-Hel
President Rebecca O'Connell has an
explanation for the drop in the
number of rushees.
This year was also the first in
history that no Rush Violations were
recorded.

A Rush Violation involves
breaking the Code of Silence be
tween sorority members and rush
ees imposed during the weeks of
Formal Rush. A violator is usually
expelled from Rush.
"I'm especially happy with
this new development," says Claire
Christman, president of Chi Omega.
For the most part, Formal
Rush has pleased everyone. Both
Halpin and O'Connell are excited
about the changes that occurred this
year. "Overall, it went really well,"
sums up O'Connell.

Gettysburg College on Channel Five

by Kabir Kumai
Staff Reporter The Gettysburg College
_Television Station (GCTV)
broadcasted for the first time
in many years, this Saturday,
Valentine's Day from 7 to 9 pm
on Channel Five.
The broadcast included a
basketball game between Johns
Hopkins and Gettysburg Col
lege, Video Valentines, and a
short film by a first year stu
dent titled "297."
"1 would like to have
more student films," said Matt
Bange, Station Director. "I
would like students to get cre
ative," Bange has been

invovled from the start with the
revival of the television station
since the birth of the idea last
October.
"There were revival com
mittee meetings most of last
semester," he said. "We wanted
to organize it in a way we
thought it would make it," he
added.
"We had all the equip
ment we needed to start up,"
said Mike Wooden, Student
Advisor to the station. Wooden
was involved in an earlier at
tempt to revive the station
which failed. "It failed then
because it did not have enough
backing," he said.
" We have a number of

people dedicated to the sta
tion," said Wooden "But we
need to get people involved -
not just the people in the sta
tion." The Station members had
been collecting Video Valen
tines in the main lobby of the
College Union Building last
week. "We didn't get as many
valentines," said Wooden.
"They were under six min
utes," said Bange.
The Station decided to go
ahead with the broadcast on
Valentine's Day. Due to the
lack of programming material
the same program has been
scheduled to be shown from 7
p.m. to 9 p.m. this week.
"It had to have a start,"
said Wooden. "Now that we
are on the air it will attract
more people," said Bange.

The time slot of 7 to 9 pm
coincides with television pro
grams on popular stations. "We
are right now competing with
primetime TV - that is a given,"
said Bange.
Bange hopes that the
channel and station will be no
ticed if viewed more often. "I
think it will take a while," he
added.
The Station plans to build
up its programming by sched
uling with academic depart

Zalewski runs for Senate President

Treasurer feels "very qualified" for position

by Ann Marie Bieli
Staff Reporter Sara Zalewski is a junior
at Gettysburg College and is
double majoring in philosophy
and political science. She is the
treasurer of Student Senate this
year, and is currently running
for the position of president for
next year. Sara believes that
her many activities, her well
roundedness, and her experi
ence in Student Senate over the
last three years make her the
best candidate for the job.
Zalewski has been ex
tremely involved during her
four years here at Gettysburg
College. She has been the
president of the Class of 1999
for the last three years. She
stated, "We have a really suc
cessful, great class govern-

She has been a member of
Gender Benders for two years,
an appointed member of the
student conduct review board
for two years, and a tour guide
for three years.
Zalewski has been also
been indirectly involved with
Gettysburg Students Against
Racism (GSAR). Sara has sat
in on the Commission for
Women, worked in the politi
cal science department, is a
member of the women's rugby
team and is currently the sec
retary of the newly established
pre law society.
Zalewski believes the nu¬

merous activities she has beer
involved with have made her i
very well rounded person anc
have enabled her to make some
important contacts. Most im
portant to this election how
ever, are the positions she has
held in Student Senate and as
an important member of sen
ate committees.
Zalewski has sat in on
many executive senate meet
ings. Sara believes this is per
haps the number one reason
she is more qualified for the
position of president of student
senate than her opponents,
John Dunlap and Earl Redding.
Zalewski stated, "the
other candidates have never sat
in on executive meetings, they
don't know how to run the
meetings or execute the rules,
things which are necessary
when being president."

Zalewski has many con
cerns and goals for the upcom
ing year and Student Senate,
She wants to create initiatives
for campus traditions, old and
new. She also wants to concen
trate on Gettysburg's school
spirit. She stated that she feels
the campus community is be
ginning to lose its school spirit.
She also stated that she plans
to strengthen the ties between
faculty, students, and adminis
tration. Another important
goal for Zalewski is to bring the
Gettysburg campus closer to
the Gettysburg community.
Creating new goals for

senate is not Zalewski's only
objective, she is also con
cerned with continuing and
improving upon current ac
complishments of student sen
ate. She hopes to continue to
worktowards adequate repre
sentation of the student body
in student senate. She also
want to continue the social
programming and the answer
ing and confronting of stu
dents' concerns and issues.
She stated, " I feel very
qualified for the position of
president of Student Senate. I
have always had the best in
tentions to improve campus
and continue the positive
things." .

In the beginning of the
current semester, Zalewski
dropped many of her activi
ties to ensure she could take a
full responsibility if elected
president of Student Senate.
Sara is now solely involved in
Student Senate and class gov
ernment.
Zalewski reiterated sev
eral times that she is not run
ning for this position as a "re
sume builder." She said, "I
have a genuine concern for the
student body and I am not do
ing it just for the name."
Student senate elections
will be held February 23, 24,
and 25 in the College Union
Building.

Liberating our bodies

by Cara Masucci
Staff Reporter The message is inescap
able: the thinner you are, the
better. The constant bombard
ment with magazine and tele
vision commercials trying to
sell weight loss products has led
many Americans to hold up an
ideal that has never really ex
isted. This in turn leads many
to eating disorders in attempt
to capture what is in vogue. A
great number of people realize
this, but really do not do any
thing about it. In a campus
wide effort to increase aware
ness and further movement to
expel eating disorders from the
Gettysburg College campus,
next week has been deemed
Eating Disorder Awareness
Week.

There are three main
types of eating disorders: an
orexia nervosa, bulimia
nervosa, and compulsive over
eating.
The first, anorexia
nervosa, is a disorder where a
person eats too little in order
to stay thin. This often leads
to the point of emaciation.
Many people suffering from
the disorder have an intense
fear of gaining weight and eat
ing foods with any fat. The
disorder can also lead to over
exercise in order to shed
pounds. Many times those
with the disorder still see them
selves as overweight, even
though everyone else around
them could be telling them they
are too thin.

Unfortunately, being too
thin is not the only problem
anorexics face. Many times de
hydration and kidney problems
can occur. Hair and nail loss
can take place, as well as severe
cardiac problems. Other
symptoms associated with the
disorder are dry skin, insomnia,
stress fractures, constipation,
and, in women, amenorrhea
(loss of menstruation). It is es
timated that between five and
eighteen percent of those suf
fering from anorexia will die.

Bulimia nervosa sufferers
are characterized by severe
binging and purging in order
to keep weight off. Purging
may come by way of vomiting
or through the use of laxatives.
Use of diuretics and excessive
exercise may also be employed.
The behavior may be done
sporadically over the course of
a month or many times a day.
Bulimics often times have pe
t ir" _^j——mmimxm _.g._Mifl_^iB'' *-

riods of rapid weight loss and
gain. Like anorexia, there are
many medical problems asso
ciated with bulimia nervosa.
Digestive disorders, constipa
tion, severe dental problems
and loss of teeth, skin rashes,
hair loss, amenorrhea, and os
teoporosis may occur. Vomit
ing can cause bleeding of the
esophagus, seizures, and severe
cardiac problems as well. In
many cases, bulimia can also
cause death.
The third disorder, com
pulsive overeating, is some
times pushed into the shadow
of the other two disorders.
Compulsive overeaters go on
periods of binging and may
become obese.
People suffering from

this disorder oftentimes suffer
from shortness of breath, high
blood pressure, and joint prob
lems. The problem can become
life threatening in that it can
cause heart disease, heart at
tacks, diabetes, and contribute
to certain forms of cancer.
With all the ill effects of
eating disorders, it becomes
very confusing why many,
sometimes as much as one-fifth

of the population turns to these
options. Eating disorders do
not exclude males, but the ma
jority with the disorders are fe
male. In fact, the victims do not
include only ordinary women.
Famous figures such as Karen
Carpenter (who died from the
medical complications of an
eating disorder) and the late
Princess Diana was suffering
from eating disorders. It is a
problem that affects everyone.
No one is immune.
There are many cultural
and psychological factors that
play a role in causing the disor
der. First, it is no secret that
American culture encourages
people to base self-worth and
esteem on body weight. Ac
cording to Frances Parker of the
counseling center, the fashion

industry is playing a large part
in the problem. The women
in magazines are taped up and
electronically distorted, so
when one is trying to measure
up to that idea!, they are not
able to. The models themselves
are not even able to. For most
women, the genetic makeup is
such that the boylike figure
deemed attractive is not acces
sible.

Parker is quick to point
out, though, that it is beautiful
to have that body type in the
same way it should be seen as
beautiful to have a whole
myriad of body types. Parker
states, "All of us have to be ac
cepting of diversity in every
way. People cannot be the same
size in the same way they can
not be the same race or reli
gion." The purpose of next
week is to further the accep
tance of diversity in body types.
Debbie Fielder, Chair of the
President's Commission on
Women: Eating Disorder Task
Force, states that the group
wants to go beyond awareness
and develop serious and coor
dinated efforts on the campus
to expel the problem. Part of

the focus of next week's events,
according to Fielder, will be to
make known to all students at
Gettysburg what services are
available to them if they or
someone they know has an eat
ing disorder. Support at the
college includes individual
therapy, nutrition consultation,
medical testing to check for ill
effects of the disorders, and
numerous other services and
referrals. Fielder also said there
will be a nutritionist coming to
speak to the College next week
to demonstrate "what is normal
and what is a disorder." Fielder
agrees with Parker in some of
the causes for the disorders.
"The body myths are learned
and culturally situated," she
stated.

Both women are quick to
point out, though, that al
though society can be viewed
as having the most profound
affect on the presence of eat
ing disorders, it is not a cut and
dry problem. An eating disor
der can sometimes stem out of
emotional conflict. It can be
come a learned coping skill
used to rechannel anger, sad
ness, anxiety, and even joy. The
destructive behavior can also be
learned from people in the
person's environment who
abuse themselves through other
destructive behaviors such as
alcohol and drug abuse. That
is why it is important for a per
son suffering from an eating
disorder to get therapy to find
a way out of the web of destruc
tion.

According to junior Julie
Wilmer, the campus wide push
to eliminate eating disorders
will be fueled by the commis
sion. "What we are trying to do
is slam the campus with infor
mation," she says. Packets will
be distributed to athletes, resi
dent advisors, and members of
the Greek system. The idea be
hind being so inclusive with
those receiving the packets is
to get everyone involved.

Starina—drag queen Albert
(Lane).

Armand's brief
twenty years ago with _
fitness mogul I
Katherine Archerl
(Christine Baranski, I
Marianne of tv'sl
Cybill) has left him I
with a son, Val I
(Futterman), whomB
she has never met. I
Armand and Albert
have raised Val and I
sent him off to college. I
Val returns from I
school announcing_^
that he is engaged to a

affair

girl he met there, and the happy
little household goes into a
frenzy. His engagement to Bar
bara (Calista Flockhart, star of
Fox's Ally McBeal), the daugh
ter of conservative senator
Kevin Keeley (Hackman),
could potentially cause trouble
for her prominent father's up
coming election.
Keeley is the vice-presi
dent of the Coalition for Moral
Order. The Keeleys' tranquil

political life has recently be
come shrouded in scandal fol
lowing the death of senator Eli
Jackson, the co-founder of the
coalition. Keeley decides that
the announcement of his
daughter's pending marriage
might undo some of the dam
age caused by the shady cir
cumstances surrounding
Jackson's death.

The Keeleys decide to
take a vacation to Miami to
hide from the press and to meet
their future in-laws. The only
problem is that Barbara hasn't
exactly told her parents the
whole truth about Val's family
life. They think he is from a
traditional ail-American family,
and Louise Keeley (Wiest) be
lieves that he is the cultural at
tache to Greece.
Val and Armand begin a

complete overhaul of then
lives. Armand and Albert have
to redecorate their flashy apart
ment and change their manner
isms. They also have to do
something about their con
spicuously gay maid, Agadot
(Azaria). Can they play it
straight?
Lane's performance is hi
larious, as he captivates the
audience as

the overly the
atrical Albert.
Hackman plays the con
servative sena
tor with ease;
it's as though
he was meant
to play that
part.
Futterman is
excellent as

_BiHIHHiV tne average
college guy
with a not-so-average family.
Azaria, who has recently been
in the film version of Charles
Dickens' Great Expectations, is
startlingly funny as the maid
aspiring to be a performer.
Williams gives a wonderful per
formance, playing the role with
deftness and sincerity.
This movie is indeed an
original. It is a witty twist on
the sentimental empty-nest
tale.

Do you know what you're sleeping with?

by Leah Bagley and Amanda
Swank Contributing Reporters
One in four people have
a sexually transmitted disease
(STD), which means that as you
look around, at least one per
son near you is infected. The
scariest part of these statistics
is that many people are asymp
tomatic, which means they are
not aware that they have an
STD, and therefore that they
can spread the disease unknow
ingly. STDs can be treated, but
few can be cured.
Human Papillomavirus
(HPV) is one of the most com
mon STDs; approximately 40
million Americans are infected
with it. Sexually active women
under the age of twenty-five are
the most susceptible to contract
this disease. HPV is rarelv dis¬

cussed and therefore the con
sequences are more dangerous.
The symptoms may not show
for months or even years, but
this disease can lead to cervical
cancer and infertility. Symp
toms appear as warts in the
genital area, or internal lesions.
HPV cannot be cured, only
"cleared" from the body with
treatment.
Chlamydia infects three
to four million Americans, in
cluding ten percent of all col
lege students. Eighty percent
of those who have contracted
chlamydia show no symptoms.
Symptoms can include whitish
discharge for males, and itch
ing, burning, and discomfort in
the genital area for women.
Women who are infected have
a high risk of developing pel
vic inflammatory disease,
which ran lead to infertility.

Treatments for chlamydia in
clude antibiotics and erythro
mycin.
Syphilis is categorized
into three levels of seventy de
pending on the symptoms. The
primary stage includes painless
chancre on the external geni
tals. The secondary stage
symptoms are skin lesions and
achiness. The tertiary stage
includes lesions and problems
within the nervous system. The
only treatment for syphilis is
penicillin and the disease may
remain contagious for life.
Each year, more than
600,000 cases of gonorrhea are
reported. Symptoms for men
include milky white discharge
and a burning sensation when
urinating. Females experience
abnormal vaginal discharge and
inflammation of the vagina, but
80 percent of women do not

show any symptoms. Gonor
rhea can also lead to pelvic in
flammatory disease and, when
passed from mother to fetus,
may cause blindness to an in
fant. Penicillin is the only treat
ment. Genital herpes affects
half a million people each year,
and there is no cure, only sup
pression treatments. Symp
toms are lesions, warts, and
blisters which can be either in
the genital area or in the
mouth. If left untreated, a fe
vefmay result which may cause
meningitis and extremely pain
ful sores. Washing with soap
and water twice daily is a
simple at-home treatment;
painting lesions with podophyl
lin must be done under a
physician's care.

AIDS is the most well
known STD because of the epi

demic proportions that it has
reached. Young women who
are sexually active are the most
high risk group for contracting
\IDS. As we all know, there is
no cure for the virus, but there
are treatments to prolong the
life of the infected person.
The most preventative
measure for avoiding the con
traction of an STD is absti
nence, but if you are sexually
active, wearing a condom will
greatly decrease your chances
of becoming infected. Some
STDs are transferred by just
rubbing or touching the in
fected areas. Being aware that
all of us need to take precau
tions against all STDs, not only
AIDS, is our best defense
against the spread of these dis
eases. All STDs have the po
tential to change the direction
of vour life forever.

Curtain Call
The Gospel according to the South

by Glen Beck
Theater Columnist
Cotton Patch Gospel, the
toe-tapping musical by folk
singer Harry Chapin, opens at
Kline Theater on Thursday,
February 26. Produced by the
College's theater arts depart
ment, the musical features the
Owl and Nightingale Players.
Based on the book The
Cotton Patch Version of Mat
thew and John by Clarence Jor
dan, Cotton Patch Gospel is set
in the South and tells the story
of the life of Jesus in very

American terms. Bethlehem
becomes Gainesville, Georgia,
while Jerusalem is represented
by Atlanta. Although the story
adheres closely to the Gospels,
the interpretation, the charac
ters, and the music are very
American.
The music is primarily
bluegrass. The songs range
from the rousing opening
"Somethin' Brewin' in
Gainesville" to Herod's aggres
sive declaration "I Did It." The
neighbors sing that "It Ain't
Easy Growing Up to be Jesus,"
but later state that he is indeed

a "Dangerous Man." Mary and
Joseph offer the plaintive and
beautiful "You are Still My
Boy," while the entire company
joins in for the high-spirited
"Goin' to Atlanta." The play is
brimming with good humor,
and the music is sure to set the

audiences toes a-tapping.
The director of Cotton
Patch Gospel is Professor Emile
O. Schmidt, and the designer
of the production is Professor
Jerome O. Hanson, both mem
bers of the College's theater
arts department. Visiting pro
fessional artists engaged for the
production include musical di
rector Don Bollinger, choreog
rapher Paula Kellinger, and
New York designer Stephen
Quandt.
Seventeen members of
O&N perform more than sixty
roles. First year student Reco
Grisby is featured as Jesus,

Duncan Niederer as Matthew,
Jennifer MacMurtrie and Glen
Beck as Mary and Joseph, Tim
Johnsen and Paul Lapato as the
brothers Rock and Andy, Brad
Cerilli as John the Baptist, Phil
Anderson as Pilate, Alec
Beekmans as Jud, Megan
Manthey as Dr. Caiaphas, Jen
nifer Baumgartner and Hannah
Roth as Satans, Allison
Kennedy and Michael Harp as
TV evangelists Timmy and
Tanya, Justin Arnold as the
Heavenly Messenger,
Samantha Gregg as the Angel,
and Mary Cordero as the Rev
erend Troy.

In addition, each actor
plays several other roles.
The production staff in
cludes Ashley Brown and
Lauren Wells, stage managers;
Jody Robertson, master electri¬

cian; Allison Perry, costumes;
Christa Zuber, properties; Glen
Beck, publicity; and Corinna
Krauskopf and Brian
Hershfeld, shop supervisors.
Cotton Patch Gospel will

open on Thursday, February 26
at 8 p.m. Other performances
will follow on Friday, Feb. 27
at 8 p.m.; Saturday, Feb. 28 at
2 p.m. and 8 p.m.; Monday
March 2 at 4 p.m.; and Tues¬

day, March 3 at 8 p.m. Admis
sion is free. Tickets are re
quired for the Friday, Saturday,
and Monday performances and
may be obtained at the theater
department office.

Marriage of comedy 6c the 80's

by Dan Larkin and Mike Petro
Movie Columnists
Mike: I must confess, I
was really excited when I saw
that The Wedding Singer had
come to town. Given the fact
that I find Happy Gilmore and
Billy Madison such fun, it-was
a natural reaction for me to get
excited. I figured that Adam
Sandier set to the tune of the
1980's would be an instant
recipe for movie hilarity. '
Dan: I admit that I'm
generally a bit of a snob when
it comes to my taste in movies
But darn it, I'm a sucker for
Adam _handler's low-brow cin
ematic exploits, too. It's a bit
of a guilty pleasure, but Billy
Madison makes me laugh like
few other movies can, no mat
ter how many times I watch it.
So I was looking forward to 1 this

one. Well, I won't keep you in
suspense for too long. I really
liked this movie. What Adam
Sandier and his writers, includ
ing Carrie Fisher, the queen of
the romantic comedy, have pro
duced is a wackv and eniovable

romantic comedy with characters
that are just fiat out fun.
Adam Sandier (Shakes the
Clown, Airheads) plays Robby
Hart, the best wedding singer in
town. After being left at the al
tar, Robby Spins into depression.
It takes the companionship of a
friendly waitress Julia, played by
Drew Barrymore (_Ftrestarter,
Bad Girls) to break him out of
his funk.
But Julia is set to marry
creepy the Don Johnson wanna
be, Glenn, played by Matthew
Glave ('Baby's Day Out, "Jag "),

so Robby's on a mission to win
her over.
Fans ofSandler's expecting
The Wedding Singer to be filled
with the nonstop, in-your-face,
ridiculousness of Billy Madison
and Happy Gilmore won't find
that here. But that's no reason
not to enjoy The Wedding Singer.
The humor is bit more restrained,
but it's still a very funny movie.
Sandier does a nice job coupling
comedy with a touching roman
tic story. The comedy/romance
marriage usually fails miserably
but it works well here.
This movie is good fun. I

enjoyed the actors and, unlike
his other movies, which are
pure silliness, this movie ac
tually attempts a plot, and
doesn't do a bad job with it.
While I disagree that his
other movies have no plot
(getting through grades 1-12
in six months, winning the pro
golf tour to save grandma's
house, these are plots), but I'll
concede that The Wedding
Singer is a bit more story ori
ented than Sandler's other
films. Setting the movie in
1985 is what provides the
movie with its goofy charm
(Billy Idol makes a guest ap
pearance!). The movie is filled
with great music from the
greed decade, and, unlike
Blues Brothers 2000, the mu
sic doesn't carry a lousy
movie, but compliments a
good one.
1 enjoyed The Wedding
Singer. / give it three and a
half stars (out of five).

I give The Wedding
Singer three and a half out
of five stars for just letting
you have fun with a movie.
Go see it.

Eating disorders

continued from page 5

also be having a learning lunch
on Wednesday at noon, at
which survivors of eating dis
orders, on both the friendship
and personal level, will talk.
This event and others will be
listed in the Gettysburgian this
week. Parker also made known
that it is important for men to
work at reversing eating disor
ders. "Both women and men
need to stand up." Both of the
sexes need to take the pressure
off of each other and to be
more accepting of individual
differences. Parker also added
that people's values should be
inclusive.
There exists an even more
unfortunate side of the disor
der. The problem is not get
ting better; it is getting worse.
More men are coming in with
disorders that stem some of the
time from sports dieting.

According to Wilmer, "Al
though eating disorders are
commonly perceived as a fe
male disease, you cannot ignore
the percentage of men with the
disorders."
If vou are concerned

about your own eating habits
or those of a friend, there are
places to turn. . Parker states
that you should be calm with a
person you think has a disor
der, and not berate them.
Tell them that the behav¬

you are ng scares you.
Discuss your concerns with a
professional, but realize you
may be rejected.
Do not, however, take the
role of counselor or monitor
food. It could cause more harm
in the long run.
If you are concerned that
you might have an eating dis
order, you should seek help. A
small percentage of people are
able to get better on their own,
but the majority need help.
There are also organiza
tions you can contact both in
the community and nationally.
The best thing you can
do, however, is accept who you
are and realize everyone is dif
ferent. That, according to all
three women, is the focus for
next week. Accepting everyone
is a goal the task force hopes
to accomplish through next
week's events.

Library BULLETin

by Libby Musselman
Library Columnist
Q: Dear Libby, I can't
study in ray room—it's too
noisy. And the library is a so
cial center. Where can I get
some quiet?
The second, third and
fourth floors are for quiet
study. I recommend the
fourth floor study carrels and
the third floor study bays. The
first floor can't be a quiet area
because of the circulation
desk, reference desk, and of
fices, and neither can the
ground floor, which has pho
tocopiers, the computer lab,
and media services. We can't
make every floor quiet, but
levels two, three, and four are
designated quiet floors.

Q.: Dear Libby, I've
come to the library in the
morning three times this se
mester to take out a reserve
video, and each time, it hasn't
been returned yet! How can I
find out who has it? Don't
worry, you won't be named as
an accessory.
Unfortunately for you,
PA law - Title 24 P.S. Section
4428 (PA Act 198490, Sec
tion 428) declares all library
circulation and borrower
records are confidential. Fur
thermore, the American Li
brary Association's Code of
Ethics promises to "protect
each library user's right to
privacy and confidentiality

with respect to information
sought or received and resources
consulted, borrowed, acquired,
or transmitted." Of course—if
you were the one in question—
you'd be happy this protection
was in place. The only recourse
you have is to complain to your
professor that the reserves are
unavailable when you've needed
them. One action that your pro
fessor could take would be to
curtail everyone's ability to take
the reserve item from the library
at all—but we don't want that,
do we? The best solution is for
people to be timely in returning
the reserve items they check out.
Libby's tip of the week: If
you need a book that has been
checked out, the library can re
call any book or put a "hold" on
it for you. If it is an emergency
and you are sure that someone
else in your class has it, some
one will call that person and see
if he or she is willing to share.

When you drop in: Check
out the display cases on the first
floor of the library. The four
cases include pictures and art
from students who went on the
winter break service learning
trips and contributed materials
to the displays. The four service
learning sites: Luther Place,
Washington, D.C.; Woodside,
Jamaica; Greene County, Ala
bama; and Cajamarca, Peru.

Al Gore for president

by Libby Main
Political _Columnist
Despite the investigation
of many of President Clinton's
closest confidants and staff
members, one key political
player has escaped connection
to the nasty Lewinsky scandal.
Vice President Al Gore, as
usual, remains unconnected to
allegations of wrongdoing. And
yet Gore is behaving appropri
ately by standing behind the
president without directly ad
dressing the scandal. Along
with a high level of morality,
there are many other positive
aspects of Al Gores intellect
and character which make him
the best candidate for president
in the year 2000.
Americans who think that
Al has escaped charges because
he is an uninvolved vice presi¬

dent are uninformed. Since
taking office in 1993, Gore has
been actively involved in the
formulation of many executive
policies.
Gore conducted a now
famous survey of the efficacy
of the federal government
which produced hundreds of
specific recommendations and
cost savings reforms to improve
the government and save tax
payers money. Gore also
served as chair of the Violent
Crime Control and Law En
forcement Act of 1994's Crime
Prevention Council. In the
realm of foreign policy, Al Gore
is integrally involved as a co
chair of several binational com
missions.
Al Gore's commitment to
and leadership on environmen
tal issues is unparalleled. He
has said that protection and

preservation of the earth is one
of the most important issues
facing this generation. Acting
upon his concerns, Gore estab
lished the GLOBE program to
increase environmental aware
ness among children around
the world.
Gore is also very knowl
edgeable in the areas of science,
space and technology policy.
He was aware of the introduc
tion of the Information Super
Highway almost 17 years ago,
and since then has become a
recognized national leader in
the development of the Na
tional Information
Infostructure. A president who
is familiar with computer tech
nology would help focus na
tional efforts to help America
regain strength in the global
marketplace.
Al Gore is a caring, intel¬

ligent individual. He has the
experience in government,
strength of character, an'd dedi
cation to issues that will affect
this country for the better that
America needs. Yes, Al Gore
appears stiff and uncomfort
able in front of television, cam
eras, but he is at ease when
meeting one on one with gov
ernment leaders.
Gore is the son of former
U.S. Senator Albert Gore, Sr.
and he was raised in both Ten
nessee and Washington as a re
sult of his fathers government
career. Al Jr received a degree
in government with honors
from Harvard University where
he roomed with famous actor
Tommy Lee Jones. After gradu
ation, Gore voluntarily enlisted
in the Army and served in Viet
nam. After his military service,
Gore attended Vanderbilt Uni¬

versity, married Mary Elizabeth
Tipper Aitchenson and eventu
ally ran for the U.S. Congress.
Gore won an election in 1976
and served eight years in the
House. He was then elected to
the U.S. Senate in 1984 and
1990. Al Gore would make
an excellent U.S. President.
On a different topic, I
would like to commend Presi
dent Clinton for considering a
tough policy stand against Iraq.
Persons who criticized
Clinton's lack of military expe
rience have to admit that the
President is taking a hard-line
approach to keep the U.S./U.N
inspection going. A possible
bombing of Baghdad is a much
more decisive move than
former veteran and President,
George Bush decided upon.
Lets not forget that Al Gore is
a veteran! Gore 2000!

nPQ The Greek Word IKN

by Earl Redding
IFC Public Relations
Greek life is back and in
full swing this semester as the
three and a half weeks of
pledging come to a half way
point. In total, about 150 men
and 90 women are pledging
our 11 Fraternities and 5 So
rorities. This year, however,
Alpha Xi Delta hopefully be
came trailblazers as they
dropped out of formal rush
after the first weekend and
decided to rush informally
with many events such as
mocktails before the Snow
Ball. All of the Greek commu
nity wishes Alpha Xi the best.
The sorority pledges
were busy this past weekend
at Chi Omega's annual Mr.
Fraternity where they danced
and sang in commercials. The
Chi Omega pledges ended the
highly eventful evening to
Mase's "Bad Boy" while Delta
Gamma, Gamma Phi Beta, Al¬

pha Delta Pi, and Alpha Xi
Delta also livened up the crowd
with routines. The highlight of
the evening though was the Mr.
Fraternity contest.
Tony DeFail of Alpha Chi
Rho took home the crown with
a stellar and steady perfor
mance that captivated the
crowd with his rendition of
Sublime'a "What I Got," and
was helped out by the guitar
playing of Mike Soltesz. Mike
Ben'ary of Fiji was the runner
up with his performance high
lighted by his singing and pi
ano playing to Ben Folds Five's
"Brick". Gary Lawson of Phi
Sigma Kappa was second run
ner-up also with a steady per
formance. The biggest cheers
however, were given to the
cowboy who was not partici
pating in Mr. Fraternity but
wowed the female audience
with a strip tease.

This weekend will also be
busy among Greeks as Sigma
Alpha Epsilon and Alpha Delta

Pi team up to host a Mardi Gras
dance-a-thon on Friday night
to benefit the Ronald
McDonald House. Everyone
on campus is invited, and the
last person dancing will win a
hundred dollars as well as the
best male and female dancers
will be crowned King and
Queen of Mardi Gras. Please
participate and show your sup
port for a worthwhile cause.
Next weekend, the 27th
of February, Sigma Nu will be
hosting MANDAY HUGE, a
band from Nags Head, North
Carolina from 10-1 pm for
an all campus BYOB party. The
event is helped by the $50,000
Dr. Haaland has given to the
student body. If you would like
to check out more information
on MANDAY HUGE, you can
visit their web-site at http://
www.mandayhuge.com.
Again, good luck to all
the pledges and congratulations
to Tony DeFail, Mr. Fraternity,

Strike down the tyrant

by LA. Isherwood
Columnist

the matter is that everyday the
United States government is
sending hundreds of troops and
supplies to the Middle East in
anticipation of military conflict
with the tyrant, Saddam
Hussein. Why is there now the
possibility of war?
In 1991, the Gulf War
came to a close after the Iraqi
army crumpled under the force
of the allied coalition to free
Kuwait. Most of us undoubt
edly remember watching the
nightly news, anticipating our
victory over such an evil little
man as Saddam Hussein. The
United States was, for the first
time since Vietnam, in favor of
- continued on page 12 •
see Tyrant

Carl von Clausewitz, a
nineteenth-century military
tactician, stated that "the aim
of all action in war is to disarm
the enemy." Such a statement
concerning the ever-prevalent
war with Iraq is quite accurate
concerning United States
policy.
Over the weekend, I was
appalled to discover the
plethora of people across our
campus not remotely aware of
the current crisis in the Gulf. I
know that at college sometimes
it is difficult to keep in touch
with current events, but when
one's nation is on the brink of
war, such negligence becomes
intolerable. The simple fact of

Consider this

Has anyone ever noticed
the long lines at the salad bar
in Servo? You stand, attempt
ing to avoid being swept away
by the pushing crowd, while
skinny girls place skimpy
amounts of greenery onto their
plates.
As with any college cam
pus, eating disorders are a not
so-hidden reality at Gettysburg
College. With National Eating
Disorder Awareness Week
coming up, the campus com
munity needs to make a spe
cial effort not only to acknowl
edge the presence of the prob
lem within its own institutions
and student body, but to search
for causes and propose solu
tions. Are there things on this
campus that promote eating
disorders?'Sources say yes.
Take a look at the wrestling
team...how do you think some
of the lighter athletes maintain
such a low weight level in a
sport that requires a large
amount of muscle?
And what about the
Greek system? Though hazing
is illegal on this campus, cer
tain sororities still seem to 'en
courage' their pledges to as
semble for a review dressed in
only their underwear, during

which the 'problem areas' or
their bodies will be circled with
black magic marker.
Though these are just a
few incidents out of what is
most likely a countless amount,
it is apparent that some activi
ties supported by the college
encourage unhealthy eating
behaviors. Although most
people do not realize the ex
tent to which these forces cre
ate low self-esteem and poor
body image, they indeed have
a serious impact upon the way
that students look at them
selves in the mirror each morn
ing. When a thin woman
looks in the mirror and sees
nothing but fat, and when an
athlete cannot afford to gain
even a pound or two without
the fear that they will be un
able to compete in the next
competition, there is a prob
lem. The college has contrib
uted to this situation by not
doing enough to educate stu
dents about the dangers of
these actions.
The upcoming programs
intended to inform and edu
cate our students will hopefully
be the first step in creating a
healthier campus environment.

Greek problems

by Jay Spiese
Columnist We are now full swing
into the time that organiza
tion leaders fear. Every club
and activity around campus
experiences a drop in mem
bership and participation. It
is tragic that students are
forced to choose between
participating in many activi
ties around campus and be
coming Greek.
The problem we find
with Greek society is two
fold. First we lose members
to what is basically a drink
ing club. My Greek readers
are surely, at this point, go
ing to spout off their tired
refrain, "We do more than
just party." You can point to
perhaps one or two philan¬

thropic events that your group
organizes each year. If you
include participation in events
organized by other groups
then it does appear like you
actually do some good for the
campus. I, however, hold you
to the same standard as other
clubs. I will not accept your
participation in an activity you
did not organize as evidence of
your positive contribution to
this campus. When that is
taken away we are left with
only drinking and partying.
Secondly, Greek society
is not composed of individu
als as much as herds. The T
shirt I used to see sorority
members wearing unintention
ally stated the truth, "No mat
ter what the letter, we are all
Greek together." It is amazing
how soon after rush people

follow their Greek brothers
and sisters like so many cattle.
People who used to think on
their own now resign them
selves to accepting the views of
the group. This is arguably the
gravest harm that Greek soci
ety causes on this campus.
They are a stifling influence on
the individual.
I praise those individuals
who have rebelled against
Greek life by leaving
their Fraternity or Sororit
. I also support all indepen
dents. You are the individual
voices on campus that make the
difference. I also hope that
many of those pledging this
year take a long hard look at
the group they are joining. Do
not surrender your individual
ity to the mob. Be independent
rather than a slave.

by Cammie Grant
Columnist The current hot topic
in the world is Operation
Desert Thunder. American
military forces are lining up
in the Persian Gulf. The
United States, Britain, Aus
tralia, Canada, Poland, Por
tugal, Germany, Sweden,
Norway and Brazil are the
countries who are support
ing the . use of force in the
Persian Gulf. The primary
question facing the countries
is what their main objective
is; is it to eliminate Saddam
Hussein's chemical and bio
logical weapons or is it to
end Saddam Hussein en
tirely? I support the Clinton

administration slogan regard
ing this potentially harmful
situation, "no more pin
pricks." For years now, the
United States has been in
volved with Iraq, and it is time
to take action, once and for all.
Hussein is a dangerous threat
to surrounding countries and
production of weapons of
mass destruction is hazardous
to the world. Saddam had
toyed around with our leaders
for years and it has reached a
point of possible mass destruc
tion. It is time for us and our
allied forces to move in, and
at the very least, make an ef
fort to eliminate all chances for
the further production of
chemical and biological weap
ons and to destroy all existing
weapons of mass destruction.

Many people do not realize the
destructive capability these
weapons possess. Inhaling a
small dust particle of Anthrax
is fatal. It is also thought that
Hussein also has the supplies to
end all life on Earth.
Countries need to unite
and support a common effort
to "disarm" Saddam Hussein.
He is an incredible danger not
only to his neighboring coun
tries, but our entire world.
Within the next couple of
weeks, I expect that there will
be action taken. According to
U.S.A. Today, opinion polls
show support exists for air
strikes.
It is time for Americans
to come together with support
ing countries.

The Pachyderm's Pulpit

A look at our college

by John Dunlap
Political Columnist
If I may, this week I
would like to take a break from
my normal tirade on national
politics or the latest scandal hit
ting the country. The politics
that I wish to concentrate on
this week are right here at Get
tysburg College. Next week
are the elections for the Execu
tive Board of Student Senate,
and following those elections,
regular Student Senate and
Class Officer elections will oc¬

cur. This past year has been a
pretty good year for Student
Senate. Just last Monday, a ma
jor victory for fairness was an
nounced during Senate as Dean
Julie Ramsey read a letter
signed by President Haaland
allowing for international stu
dents to receive financial aid to
go abroad, just like any other
student is able to. Senate has
been fighting for fairness on
this issue for longer than I have
been around, and this is a vic
tory for the entire campus.
Student Senate this past
year has made a great deal of
progress in regard to issues

dealing with the social life on
the campus. Two committees
are now working to improve
the social climate. One of these
committees has been given the
power to appropriate fifty
thousand dollars in order to
make Gettysburg a better place
to live and work. The other
committee is looking to solve
long term social issues, by pos
sibly bringing either a dance
club or bar to campus. Solu
tions to the problem that I
wholeheartedly agree with. We
now need to push it from' the
idea stage to the implementa
tion stage.
Improving the social cli
mate of our College is some
thing that we all need to be a
part of. The reaction to the
fifty thousand-dollar fund has
been strong; hopefully students
are sending a message to the
administration that we are in¬

terested in social change. One
of things which I would like to
see done is having the quarry
used once again for concerts
and all-campus parties.
More all-campus parties
would take pressure off of the
Greek system. For those who
criticize Greek organizations,

Gettysburg College needs to
realize that it owes its fraterni
ties and sororities a lot. For
years they have been the social
backbone for this college, and
now with new regulations and
the enactment of BYOB, they
have hit a period of transition.
As Treasurer of my fraternity I
am seeing how it is not easy to
run a Greek organization, but
we, as a College should be com
mitted to preserving.the Greek
System on this campus. That
starts with saving Alpha XI
Delta and keeping the Greek
system independent. By inde
pendent I mean keeping the
Greek Judicial system and not
replacing its duties with
theStudent Conduct Review
Board, as some wish.

With the College looking
at long term planning, the
housing crunch is the immedi
ate concern. Students should
not have to live at the Seminary
Not to mention that another
reason that fraternities are im
portant now is because they
house students.
Academically, som of the
ideas being examined for the
future are mixed. The college's
decision not to keep J. Martin

demic experience of my life
occurred this year with the Eu
ropean Union Simulation,
taught by Dr. DeClair. I would
bet every one of my classmates
would agree with me in regards
to the EU Simulation. Now,
not only will Dr. DeClair be
leaving Gettysburg College, the
EU Simulation is being dropped
for the time being. The Euro
pean Union is our College's
only academic competition and
year after year Gettysburg does
well. This year was no excep
tion. It could be said that we

Holman of the Japanese Stud
ies program is unbelievable.
Many of my friends in his Japa
nese classes have said that he
has been quite influential in
their college experiences. Not
only is Mr. Holman well liked
by his students and held in high
regard, this school should be
striving towards a strong Japa
nese Department. There seems
to be no logical reason not to
create a tenure track position.
There has not and will not even
be a Japanese Professor on the
tenure track at Gettysburg.
Having a strong Japanese De-

as students sometimes expect a
lot, but you know we pay a lot
to go here.
I do encourage anyone
who wants to get involved to
run for Student Senate or Class
Office. Student Senate should
be more open and expanded.
It should be a place of debate
and discussion for the campus
community. Student Senate
must succeed when the admin
istration fails us. Student Sen
ate must be responsive to our
concerns when the administra
tion ignores us. Student Sen
ate is our outlet to the admin
istration and the faculty.

partment is vitally important
when one looks at he world
today and the state of interna
tional trade.
Earlier this year President
Haaland in response to the law
suit over tenure, declared that
the court victory meant that
tenure worked; he was wrong.
For two years in a row, the con
cerns of students were not ad
equately heard during the ten
ure process. Last year, with Dr.
Edward DeClair of the Politi
cal Science Department, and
this year with the decision to
not create a position for Mr.
Holman. The greatest aca-

Tyrant

- continued from page 10 -
a war which was quick, deci
sive, and had only a moderate
loss of life. Now we are faced
with the same despotic govern
ment which our tanks and
planes hoped to eradicate in
1991. Again, our forces are
massing in the Gulf, anticipat
ing what could, within the next
few weeks, become another
war. I believe these military
actions are in the right consid
ering what e have tried to ac
complish over the last seven
years. When the Iraqi govern
ment signed the cease fire that
ended the Gulf War, they

opened their country to United
Nation's sanctions which in
clude the inspection of facili
ties allegedly used for chemi
cal and biological weapons of
mass destruction.
Over seven years, the
government of Iraq has led UN
officials on a wild goose chase
which has finally led to an in
ternational conflict due to the
barring of United States inspec
tors from these laboratories.
The United States will not tol
erate such resistance, the vio
lation of United Nation's pre
cedents, and the treaty of
1991.

The simple fact of the
matter is that this third world
terrorist is a threat to our for
eign policy within the region
and has repeatedly tried to hurt
our interests. He is a tyrant who
has killed hundreds of thou
sands of his own people to keep
his regime afloat. He has used
weapons of mass destruction on
other nations as well as on par
tisan groups within his nation.
He is a threat to freedom and
democracy, two of the ideals
which we hold so dear, and is
causing his own people harm.
Our foreign policy is not against
the people of Iraq, but rather

this evil person who calls him
self their leader. He must be
stopped, and if the greatest
army in the world won't do it,
who will?
Carl von Clausewitz also
said that "war is the continua
tion of politics by other
means," and our policy now is
that when diplomacy fails
(which it is rapidly doing), war
must take place. The regime
of Saddam Hussein is irratio
nal and fanatical, and politics
has shown that little progress
can be made with such a per
son. Thus, if diplomacy fails,
we must intervene and disarm

the enemy by force and with
great speed and strength. If we
commit force, then may our
armed forces do everything
necessary to destroy the Iraqi
army, their capability for mak
ing weapons of mass destruc
tion, and the government of
Saddam Hussein. Iraq needs to
be free, the people want to be
free, and a genocidal maniac
prevents such freedom. We
must then free Iraq from
Saddam Hussein, and force is
necessary, we as Americans for
the sanctity of our values
should support such action.

Last Saturday Gettysburg
wrestlers senior Jake Dell and
junior Marty Scarpato proved
themselves able to dominate
their respective weight classes.
Jake became only the second
wrestler ever to win four con
secutive Centennial Confer
ence championships.
With a pin, Dell, the top
rated wrestler in Division III,
boosted his incredible season
record to 33-1. It took Dell
four minutes and nineteen sec
onds to pin Ursinus College
Junior Nate McElhaney and
clinch first place in the 167
pound class.

Marty has definitely "scrapped" his way to the top

by Western Wells
B.A.S.S. Member/Contributing
Reporter Marty "Scrap" Scarpato
is a wrestler at Gettysburg Col
lege. He started his wrestling
career during his middle school
days back home. Before com
ing to Gettysburg, Iviarty
played baseball and ran cross
country in addition to wres
tling. "Scrap" is one of four sib
lings who have also been com
petitive in wrestling. When
asked about his passion for
wrestling, he simply stated that

Marty "Scrap" Scarpato
_Spott: Wrestling
Age: 20
YOG: \m
Majors HES
Hometown* _Bootbwyii PA
Personal Record: 23-9

he has been in it for years be
cause it has been in the family
"It's something that has always
been a part of my life, and I
keep going at it."
One bad memory that
might have hindered his pas
sion for wrestling was an injury
which he suffered in high
school.
Although "Scrap" had
not been pinned to the mat that
day, he had to leave with his
back flat on a stretcher. Marty
had suffered from a neck sprain
that surely scared many in the
crowd, but he healed fairly
quickly.
Like any good athlete,
Marty did not withdraw from
the sport and his tenacity pre
vailed. For those who don't
know yet, Marty will be going
to Iowa for Nationals this

weekend. He's looking for
ward to doing well among the
competition and also keeping
Jake Dell company. He feels
that this could be his big shot

it jL,
for national achievement.
He reflects back on his
season and gives his thanks to
Coach Troy Dell. Marty hopes
Coach Dell will get the full time

job as their coach. "He really
puts forth the time and effort
to make a significant differ
ence. At first, his age was ques
tionable, but soon Coach Dell's

vWvHvsseF'H
H_^ eXrjjSS-HEWj
experience prevailed."
Marty will be in Iowa for
the weekend with Jake; let's
hope all their passion pays off
in Nationals, good luck!

In case you missed it...
Hodakowski shows off his stuff in Division III Senior Bowl

by Steve Jenkins
Sports Editor
If this article would have
never been published in the
Gettysburgian, you would
never know about the mild
mannered, well groomed Bul
lets football captain named Joe
Hodakowski. Hodokowski has
been smashing the oppostion
into the ground in Mussleman
Stadium for four years and re
cently he reached the pinnacle
of his outstanding career.
On Januai y \_9, in a
snowy Fayetteville North Caro
lina, 78 of the nation's top se
nior Division III football play
ers assembled for the annual for
the USA Division III Martin
Luther King Holiday All-Star
Classic.

Hodakowski, who was
named a third team All-Amen
can for his perfomances on the
field this year, was invited to
the game to play along side
some of the top college players
in the nation.
Joe who you ask? We had
an All-Amencan on our foot
ball team this year? Yes, we did.
He wouldn't tell you if you
asked him though, rather he

would give you and answer
like, "I was part of a team, as
far as I am concerned the team
is responsible for my sucess. I
just go out and do the best I
can for them. That's all."
"Hodo" as his friends
call him, always gave all he
could for the best of the team
and perhaps that was why he
was chosen as team captain this
season. But on January 19, the
little man with the huge heart
ran into Douglas Byrd stadium
as one of the best in the nation.
But he is only five feet,
nine inches tall, and only
wieghs two-hundred pounds;
how did he hold up against the
best players in the nation? He
did more than ]ust "hold up."
Playing beside three other Di
vision III All-Amencans on the
same defensive line,
Hodakowski racked up 7 tack
les one of which was a
quaterback sack.

Hah. So much for the
big, ugly guys always being the
best football players. To rack
up those kind of stats Joe must
have used his strength, quick
ness and desire to win to over
come the sometime 300 hun
dred pound odds.

photo by Mark Aslrom
Number #54 Joe "Hodo" Hodakowski, quietly moves to assault this opposing passer.

"What thrill to play
against the best D-III players in
the country," said a smiling,
mud-splattered Hodakowski
after the game. "Here we come
the North Carolina and it
snows. It is something I will

never forget."
Although his name was
never printed in big letters (ex
cept today) and not everybody
knows his name, Joe
Hodakowski has left a perma
nent mark not only on football
team, but the collge as well. Joe

said that the game was some
thing that he will never forget;
well Joe, none of your coaches,
teammates and friends will ever
be able to forget you. Thank
you for being a part of our lives
for the last four years. It was
special.

sophomore Drew Lavenberg at
shortstop. Thorpe is coming off
an excellent senior season and
should prove to be an excellent
first year player in the colle
giate ranks.
Campo considers
Lavenberg to be the best Bullet
shortstop in his thirteen years
of coaching. Offensively, Drew
provides Gettysburg with an
exceptional bunter who can
complement the heavy bats and
work within the running game.
Behind the plate, the Bul
lets have two returning catch
ers. J ack Tanner, a sophomore,
and Ken Rittenhouse, a junior,
should effectively regulate the
baselines this spring as both are
excellent defensive ballplayers.
Campo plans to split the play¬

ing time 50/50 this season in
an effort to avoid exposing ei
ther player to injury from the
wear and tear of everyday
catching. "We have a great
group of guys this year. They
all share a great work ethic to
go along with great ability. I
think we have a legitimate shot
at the Cenntenial Conference
Championship," said Campo.
John Woods re
marked, "We have a really
young team this season and that
can cause problems. Our suc
cess will depend on how well
we are able to gell. I think we
should be able to come to
gether and play competitively
in the games that count this
season."

With junior Megan
Malloy and sophomore Jamie
Dawson both playing at full
speed, Gettysburg's inside
game is as strong as it has ever
been. Malloy, coming off an
ankle injury, is averaging nine
rebounds a game as well as 8.2
points. Dawson, who picked
up the slack during Malloy's
injury, is averaging 5.1 re
bounds and 7.9 points.
Dawson is Gettysburg's top
shooter landing 75 of her 135
attempts for 56 percent.
Another pleasant suprise
has been the inside play of
sophomore Megan McDonald.
Not only is she averaging 3.7
rebounds a game, but she has
an amazing 24 blocked shots to
her credit as well as 30 steals.
She is averaging a little over
four points a game.

Bullets reload for new season with Woods, Lunardi, and Lavenburg

If the young talent can come together, these Bullets are aimed at success

by Ted Hartman
Contributing Reporter
The Bullets baseball team
finished strong in the closing
weeks of the 1997 season, win
ning twelve of their last eigh
teen games. Coach John
Campo is hopeful that this suc
cess will continue into the
Spring of 1998, and considers
this squad a viable contender
for the Cenntenial Conference
championship.
Gettysburg's pitching
staff features proven consis
tency in its returning arms.
Sophomores Dan Sirpinski and
Paul Koether are expected to
step up this Spring and provide
the Bullets with reliable perfor
mances after sizable contribu
tions as freshmen. PJ McElroy,
also a sophomore, shares this
potential and will fill the third
position in the rotation.

Campo is not yet sure
which of his remaining seven
hurlers will be designated the
fourth starter. Juniors Pete
Rittenhouse and Matt
DeVecchi are both in conten
tion, with freshmen Tom Boob
and Drew Chiesa providing
competition as well. Out of the
bullpen the Bullets can look to
a strong group of young talents

for middle relief and late-in
mng closing.
Sophomore Jere Dee, a
first year player, is making a
smooth transition from outfield
to the mound. Ryan Sweeney
and Jeff Ellis, each freshmen,
showed an ability to pitch ef
fectively at the college level in
fall ball.
"Once we go down to
Florida we will be able to de
fine our roles better as far as
who will be middle and short
relief. Our pitching coach Lee
Rentzell is very optimistic
about this group," said Campo.
The Bullets are also en
thusiastic about their position
players. The outfield is stocked
with strong arms and speed in
sophomore Chris Lunardi, se
nior Daryl Clancy, both prob
able starters. Sophomore Greg
Kosc, and freshmen Bill Neston
and Jim Nestasi are all cur
rently vying for the remaining
position. Campo expects his
outfielders to he the table set¬

ters with an aggressive running
assault for the Bullet RBI men.
Sophomores John Woods
and Bill Beining should effec
tively plate the Gettysburg
lead-off hitters. The 1997 sea
son saw Woods tally 30 RBIs
and belt six home runs, to go

Bullet Outfilder Chris Lunardi takes a hack at an annarent weak nfferinn

along with his .404 batting av
erage. Combined with
Beining_'s power, the tandem
should make it impossible for
opposing pitching staffs to
pitch around the core of the
line-up. Though both are good
defensive first basemen, Woods
will take the field opening day,
while Beining will be slotted
as designated hitter.

"John Woods is an all
conference cabber ball player
and has the potential to be an
ail-American candidate. It is
rare to find a player that can
hit for such an average and for
great power. His six home runs
last season tied a school
record."
Third basemen Kevin
Grimm also offers power to the

Bullet arsenal. A sophomore
now, Grimm played the role of
backup infielder as a freshmen.
This year his speed and power
will most likely land him in the
heart of the Bullets order.
The middle infield will be
manned by frehsmen Bret
Thorpe at second base and

Dravis scores 1000

From Staff Reports
Despite a stunning 83-71
loss at the hands of Western
Maryland last week, the Get
tysburg College women's bas
ketball still has a bright post
season playoff picture.
Gettysburg and Western
Maryland are currently tied for
second place in the west divi
sion of the Centennial Confer
ence with 9-4 records. West
ern Maryland traveled to
league leading Johns Hopkins
(12-0 in Centennial) on
Wednesday. Gettysburg is
sporting a 16-6 overall record.
Gettysburg is currently
paced by a set of senior twins,
Jen and Steph Dravis. Steph is
the current scoring leader with
a 12.3 average and leads the
team with 51 assists. Jen is av
eraging 11.8 points a contest

and leads the team with 44
steals. However, it was Jen
who broke into the elite 1,000
point club last week and begins
the final week of the regular
seasons with 1,016 points.
Ironically enough, her 1,000th
point came on an assist from
sister Steph. She is the fifth
Gettysburg female player to hit
1000. Steph Dravis still has a
long shot of hitting 1000
points, provided Gettysburg
reaches the playoffs. She
curently has 913. Although six
other players are quite capable
of knocking down three-point
goals in a given situation, the
Dravis twins are the team lead
ers. Steph has 31 percent of
112 attempts and Jen 29 per
cent of 116 tries.

"It's not over until the fat lady sings"

Injuries hampered
by Paul Redfern
Staff Reporter
The Gettysburg College
Men's Basketball team rolled
toward the playoffs upsetting
nationally ranked Johns
Hopkins University 52-46, and
eliminating Western Mary
land, 71-66 last week. The
Bullets are now tied with
Franklin and Marshall for sec
ond place in the Western Di
vision with a 7-4 record.

On Wednesday night
Johns Hopkins came to Get
tysburg after beating them 91
51 at Hopkins earlier in the
season. The only once beaten
JHU began the game well, but
the Bullets came firing back.
After the first few min
utes of play the score was tied
4-4. Then Gettysburg caught
fire. Greg Schrieber hit two
three pointers in a row fol
lowed by a third by Kevin
Carroll.

With the score 13-4 JHU
was forced to call timeout and
regroup. The assault did not
stop as the Bullets fueled by

the Bullets of late and it looked to dash their chances at playoffs; don't stop watching just yet

offense from Senior Terry
Schofield and Sophomore
Richie Pfiel continued to build
a lead that reached 17.
The Bullets went into the
half up 10 points and playing
well. In the second half JHU
made a comeback. Gettysburg
held strong with good team de
fense and solid offensive cuts.
Sophomores Bill Davidson and
Ryan Napp had positive offen
sive performances. JHU cut the
bullets lead to three only once
with a few minutes to play, but
the Bullets held on strong to fin
ish off the win, 52-46.
The Bullets entered
Saturday's contest with Western
Maryland needing a win to stay
alive in the playoff hunt. The
Bullets won what was an elimi
nation game by the score of 71
66.

Saturday was Senior day
which was preceded by the
Alumni game. Senior Terry
Schofield and John Bauersfeld
were honored for their contri
butions to Bullets Basketball
over the last four years.
Western Maryland had

Despite a roller-coaster season the Bullets are still in the hunt for a playoff berth.

beaten Gettysburg earlier in the
season and got off to a hot start.
But team defense and hard
work helped the Bullets bounce
back as Bauersfeld hit 2 early
jump shots. Junior Matt
Rothenburger helped the Bul
lets stay in the game with some
nice high post moves.
Carroll was hot from the
outside hitting several three
pointers as did Napp. Western
Maryland played tough and
took lead with 8 minutes to go

Jen Drevis takes the ball to the goal. For more see page 23

in the game. But the Bullets
aided by the cheers of alumni
and fans, fought back.
Davidson and Pfiel along
with Schofield played well on
both ends of the floor to give
the Bullets the victory 71-66.
The Bullets played
Ursinus last night, and travel
to Franklin and Marshall on
Saturday for the regular sea
son finale. The playoff sce
narios are as follow for the last
two games:
Two Bullet wins clinch

a playoff spot
OR If Gettysburg loses to
Ursinus and defeats Franklin
and Marshall there will then be
is a tie and a game Monday
Night at Gettysburg to decide
who advances
OR If Gettysburg loses to
Ursinus and Beats Franklin and
Marshall and Franklin and
Marshall lose to Dickinson the
Bullets are assured a playoff
spot.
