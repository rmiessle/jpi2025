Parking woes plague students

lot is designed for faculty use and un
authorized student cars in the parking
lot are ticketed accordingly. Most of
those designated spots, however, are
empty Friday through Sunday, a time
when parking is most troublesome for
students.
Because of this, students like
Reiter have received parking violations
weekly.
Most tickets are given to students
who park their cars illegally between
3-6 a.m. Yet, there is little or no traf
fic on campus roads during these

Frustrated and bewildered, Get
tysburg College student Andrew
Reiter watched helplessly as his car
was towed away.
Resting on his windshield were
two yellow parking tickets and a
spring concert promotion pamphlet.
Disgruntled, Reiter walked away from
the scene without a car, unable to find
a ride home for the weekend.
"Ic's kind of ex¬

pected now," said
Reiter, 20, of
Longmeadow, Mass.
"Whether I'm study
ing in the library or
eating at the Dining
Hall, I'm periodically
checking _riiy car for
tickets."
Recently, Gettys
burg College has ac
tively increased its at
tention to parking vio
lations.
Regardless of
time, date or circum
stance, the Borough
police and Safety and
Security have intensi
fied their efforts to
control illegal parking.

"There was a campus wide study
conducted in order to analyze the
parking situation," said Gettysburg
College Safety and Security Officer
Gary Boynton. "The results are still
sketchy, yet administrative action has
taken place in regards to this concern.
That's all we can say about it now."
Some Gettysburg students say
they are fed up with the "no toler
ance" attitude portrayed by those
who ticket their cars.
Students have also voiced com
plaints about the lack of designated
parking areas. Some believe that fac
ulty, even though they are present
only four to five days a week, have
more parking spaces than students.

A recent rash of stricter ticketing has caused an uproar on campus,
causing students to press for an ultimate solution to the parking nightmares
attributed to poor planning of lots.

hours.
Some students believe there are
better solutions concerning the park
ing problems on campus.
"Instead of emptying our wallets
on a consistent basis, we as a student
body should work with the school and
devise an ulterior solution for student
parking," said first year student Chris
tina Bell, 18, of Ridgewood, N.J.
Bell received a ticket last Thurs
day for double-parking outside the
Dining Hall. Her car was running, her
hazard lights engaged, and a passen
ger sat in the front seat. Despite this,
an officer handed her a $15 ticket.
"It's these types of instances that
create an unfriendly relationship be
tween the faculty and student body,"

Bell said. "With the current expan
sion of our campus, it would only
make sense for them to include a new
parking lot for students."
Most student parking areas are
far from the heart of the campus and
provide little access to important fa
cilities like CUB and Musselman Li
brary. Bell suggested a new parking lot
behind the Dining Hall, or possibly re
moving some parking meters on ma
jor streets to help solve the problem.
She said an adjustment of the parking
hours would en
! _> - .- _* . ' ; .<iK' iahe most Rtu-

dents to leave
their cars on the
street overnight.
Instead of
parking off cam
pus, where most
students don't
feel comfortable
leaving their
cars, students
could park adja
cent to the fresh
man dorms. Do
ing so would al
low them an op
portunity to
keep their cars
on campus over
night. With the
Suites, it is be-

addition of the Quarry
coming harder to find vacant spots in
Musselman Stadium and Bream
Wright Hauser parking lots.
Despite being far from most cam
pus buildings and offices, these park
ing lots were once full of empty spots.
Students must find a parking
space before 9 p.m. in order to secure
a spot for the night.
Students who try to voice their
opinions are heard but rarely acknowl
edged. Bell said she addressed both
the faculty and Safety and Security, yet
she received little response from either
party. "I'm sure it's not on top of the
faculty's to do list, but in the eyes of
many students, it's a problem worthy
of their attention," Bell said.

Get Acquainted Day gives Class of
2004 preview

By Cammie Grant
Staff Writer
This Saturday the Gettys
burg College community will
peddle the school to prospec
tive students. The Gettysburg
College Admissions Office is
gearing up for Get Acquainted
Day. This annual program in
vites accepted students and
their families to visit Gettysburg
and to look at the College be
fore the student enrolls.

"One of the goals of Get
Acquainted Day is to entice
prospective students into en
rolling in Gettysburg College,"
said Admissions Intern Chris
tine Sedlacko.
The Exposition is a
strong component of Get Ac
quainted Day. It features stu
dent organizations and ser
vices. Hauser Field House's
perimeter will be lined with
tables used by clubs and orga
nizations to encourage ac¬

cepted students to select Get
tysburg. It is up to these orga
nizations' discretion how to
present their information.
Many clubs and organizations
choose to use brochures, pho
tos or scrapbooks.
Admissions Counselor
Dan Joo said, "In the past,
many of the students who at
tended Get Acquainted Day
have enrolled at Gettysburg.
The Get Acquainted Day Ex
position is an opportunity for
current students to help ac¬

cepted students understand the
variety of activities and services
available at Gettysburg and to
meet potential future Gettys
burg students."
The Get Acquainted Day
Exposition is an occasion for
Gettysburg College students to
express their pride and enthu
siasm for Gettysburg to pro
spective students. This day
serves as an important chance
to introduce these students to
possible _opportunities of in
volvement available at Gettys
burg College.

Shribman speaks on news in the
hands of today's media

By English 203
Journalistic Writing
Supermarket tabloids are
replacing The New York Times
and The Wall Street Journal as
prime sources for Americans'
understanding of politics, ac
cording to the Washington bu
reau chief of The Boston
Globe.
"To an alarming degree,
the press has relinquished its
educational role and has in
creased its entertainment role,"
David M. Shribman told about
50 Gettysburg College students
and faculty Monday.
Shribman said a recent
ABC News interview of Presi
dent Clinton by actor
Leonardo DeCaprio on the en
vironment is a perfect example
of the gradual merger of poli
tics and entertainment.

"Politics are based on
sound-bites these days,"'
Shribman said. "The interac
tion between politics and en
tertainment is intrusive. You
can't have one without the
other."
Shribman, who also
writes a column for Fortune
magazine, said the media in
creasingly are falling victim to
the politics of personal enter¬

tainment and public scandal.
In the television era, the
media scrutiny of politicians'
personal lives began with the
reporting of an apparent affair
of Sen. Gary Hart, D-Colo., a
presidential candidate, in
1988, Shribman said. It contin
ued with the tabloid-style re
porting of President Clinton's
relations with several women.
Finally, when Clinton's rela
tionship with Monica
Lewinsky went public, "the re
porting on the Lewinsky scan
dal was based, three out of four
times, on nameless stories and
innuendo."
When Shribman was a
reporter at The Wall Street
Journal, he said colleagues told
him about the Hart affair, but
he thought the story was news
worthy only to tabloids of the
caliber of The Star and The Na
tional Enquirer.

"The next day, every
newspaper in the world had the
story except ours," he said.
Shribman said the advent of
cable television, instead of
bringing local government
closer to the people, has re
sulted in politicians playing to
the camera.
"In the late 1970s, mem
bers of Congress were barely
presentable," he said. "Now
they all have makeup crews."

Shribman cited the NBC
television series "The West
Wing" and a long list of recent
film stars who have played the
President of the United States as
proof that the presidency has
become as much entertainment
as politics.
He credited recent presi
dential nomination victories to
the ability of Vice President Al
Gore and Texas Gov. George W
Bush to appeal to the American
public using the mass media, es
pecially television. Shribman
said former Sen. Bill Bradley, D
N.J ., lost to Gore because "it
was obvious that Bradley hated
campaigning."
Nor was Bradley the only
candidate who concentrated on
the issues. "Just look at
georgewbush.com," Shribman
said. "You will be amazed by the
number of position papers and
issues that he addresses."

Bradley might have made
a good president, but he sig
naled to the voters that he
would not enjoy the job,
Shribman said. The Washington
correspondent asked the audi
ence in CUB 260 if they would
go to a doctor who hated medi
cine, visit a dentist who hated
dental work or listen to a vio
linist who hated chamber mu
sic. By contrast, President

Franklin Roosevelt loved cam
paigning, and loved being
president, Shribman said. And
the late New York Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller might wear an In
dian headdress for a group of
Native Americans and a
yamulke for a group of Jews on
the same day, making both
groups happy.
The Internet might be
good at producing presidential
candidates' position papers,
but Shribman expressed con
cern that the Internet lacks
normal journalistic filtering for
accuracy, balance and
newsworthiness. He said it
makes the new medium dan
gerous. Anyone can publish
anything about anyone or any
issue, regardless of whether
they carry a whiff of truth.

Whatever the source, the
Internet or supermarket tab
loids, "bad news is driving out
good news," Shribman said. "If
everyone here read the news
paper on a consistent basis, it
would change the way things
are clone in Washington."
Shribman, a former re
porter for The Wall Street Jour
nal and The New York Times,
frequently appears on televi
sion shows like "Inside Wash
ington" and "Meet the Press."
He is to return to Gettysburg
College May 1.

This weekend, Gettysburg's
Dance Ensemble will perform its final
recital of the semester. The program,
entitled "Dance: The Fusion of Body
and Soul, " will take place in the CUB
Ballroom on Friday night at 7:30, and
on Sunday at 1:30. The doors open
thirty minutes ahead of time, and ad
mission is free. The Ensemble requests
only that every audience bring an item
to donate to the canned food drive that
will benefit the Adams County Food
Pantry.
Dance Ensemble recitals often fo
cus on a theme, such as "Women in
Dance, " one of last year's recitals.
However, this performance has no spe
cific theme. Instead, it includes an as
sortment of dances in a wide variety of
styles. Over fourty people will dance
in this program, and many will partici
pate in more than one number.

The various dance numbers range
in genre from ethnic to modern to clas
sical. The audience will get a taste of
eastern culture from the Indian dances
performed to traditional Indian music.
The ballet and point-shoe performances
combine classical dance styles with
melodies from the "Notting Hill"
soundtrack and the popular sound of
Shania Twain. The tapdance group will
swing to the beat of Lou Bega's
"Mambo Number 5." A song by Tori
Amos sets the mood for another mod¬

ern dance.
Adding to the diversity of the mix
is a jazz dance, done in the style of Bob
Fosse, the choreographer for Broadway
musicals such as "Cabaret" and "Chi
cago." Almost any audience member
will easily recognize his choruslme style.
Concluding the recital will be a
dance number to a well known aria by
Ricky Martin. This dance is a collabo
rative effort by members of several dif
ferent

classes. _„

who simply loved to dance. The origi
nal assemblage contained only ten danc
ers, but the organization quickly grew.
This semester, the eclectic array of
dance classes numbers eighty students
and faculty. Many participants are first
year students, which bodes well for the
continuation of the Ensemble in the fu
ture.

Dance Ensemble President Anna
Chongpinitclu takes pride in the grow
ing interest in the troupe. Student Sen
ate first recogni/.ed the group three
years ago, which strengthened its pres
ence on campus. The Ensemble reached
an even more significant landmark this
year, when its pioposal to host Com
mon Hour was accepted. It organized
and hosted "The Arts at Gettysburg,"
which was primal ily a dance recital, and

student 01 faculn member has the op
portunity to become involved in the
Dance l-nsemble In the spuit of it 1 -
founding membeis, the group isentnely
student-tun. At the beginning of each
semestei, it distributes _adveitisements
throughout the campus to atti act the m
teiest of potential instructors. Anyone
with dance experience and confidence

is eligible to teach a class, no matter how
exotic his or her dance skills may be.
Once the Ensemble has enough
committed teachers, it notifies the cam
pus via e-mail, posters, and word of
mouth about the classes offered that se
mester. Regardless of one's degree of
skill, anyone who is willing to learn to
dance may join a class. Most of the
dance students are pure amateurs, but
that doesn't stop them from working
hard and having fun.
Said sophomore Indian dancers
Katie Havens and Erin Hayden, "its re
ally amazing when you start out and you
look very out of place but then with
tune you gain confidence and you be
gin to feel the flow."
Sophomore Maria Mowry admit
ted that she is far from a professional,
but she said, "I'm excited. Everyone
has worked very hard, and it should be
a fun show." She is in the intro tap
dance class, which is actually taught by
her roommate, sophomore Debbie
Djupman.
Chongpinitclu echoed Mowry's
enrhusiam when she said about the

show, "I'm very excited about this
weekend's petformance, especially the
vanety of it. I encourage everyone to
come watch-there's something for ev
eiybody to enjoy."
Hayden and Havens also invite all
to attend the show, and to get involved
with the group: "The Dance Ensemble
is a chance for students to get in touch
with their rythmic side."

Get an Attitude: The International Club Fashion Show

By Rustom S. Davar
CONTRIBU _HNG WRITER
"Attitude! Give me some more at
titude!" Mehreen Yusuf demands a lot
of the nervous models who sashay
down the catwalk strutting their stuff.
The lights dim as each silhouette glides
smoothly through sequined sequences,
strikes a pose and melts safely into the
darkness backstage.
The audience waits in ecstatic
raptures, ready for the next dazzling
display. Is this an Avant-Garde fashion
statement from Paris or Milan?
Nope—it's the technical rehearsal for
the International Club's Annual Fash¬

ion show, which will take place this Sat
urday, April 15, in the CUB Ballroom
from 9 p.m. onward.
This is the third yeai that the
show, organized by the College's Inter
national Club, will be presented to the
College community, and like its prede
cessors it promises to be a sterling suc
cess. The Fashion Show displays a vari
ety of costumes, traditional and mod
ern, from around the world. The se
quences include styles from Southeast
Asia, Europe, Latin America, Africa,
India, Japan, and the Blend.
The startling wealth of traditional
and national costumes that members of
the Club discovered hidden in 1 emote
corners of their closets, ranges from
Romanian, Burmese, Ethiopian, Nica¬

ragua!"), lap.inese, Indonesian, and many
moie "It w._is gi eat seeing people in their
own costumes, but it was even better
seeing people in costumes outside of
their nationality. It leally biought out a
sense of "international" amongst the
Club and it's paiticipants, " remembeis
Club Secretary Pia Silveilieb, who mod
eled a Japanese Kimono m last year's
show. " I love this event and I want if to
happen eveiy yeai that I'm at school
heie." Silveilieb has actively organized
this ye.ii \ show under the guidance ui
Club President fiacy Werblow.
The show bungs a welcome dash
of coloi to the pioveibial "Getty._sbuig
Bubble " and affords us a peek at differ¬

ent styles from different cultures around
the globe.
Re/a Rahman, a junior student
and a native of Bangladesh, explained,
"My outfits are usually a blend of East
el n and Western influences. The fash
ion show lets me pick out the best styles
fiom around the world and integrate
them into my own wardrobe. The
greatest satisfaction for me would be if
someone saw me wearing my traditional
clothes such as the kamee/, and decided
that it was something they might want
to try."

BULLETS BRAWL WHEN
SPORTS TEAMS UNITE

By Robin Rogi-r
Stafi- Wrhhi
A long time ago, in a gal
axy far, far away, there were .

. S.T.A.R. Wars!
This activity is
brought to you
by "Students
Training Ath
lete :, Responsi
bly," a gioup
bettei known as
S.T.A.R.'s
S.T.A.R. Wais
takes place this
Sunday, Apnl
16th at 3:00 on

the soccer fields.
The various athletic teams ate
paired up to compete in a num
ber of competitions
Each team includes lep-

lesentatives horn a men's and
a women's team. Also, each
team chooses a representative
to paiticipate in a scavenger
hunt. At the end or the com
petitions, the points are tabu¬

lated to detei mine the wmnei s,
which have often included the
men's baseball team, hoi some
leason, they have managed to
establish a winning stieak that
must be challenged.
So, what exactly are
STA.R.'s? S.T.A.R.'s are stu
dents who belong to the Stu
dent-Athlete Assistance Pio
giam. This piogram was insti
tuted to toim a support gioup
foi athletes, so that they may
be successful studentathletes.
The piogiam is based on the
idea that students aie heie to
team, _mt.\ the S.T.A.R.'s can

help to ensuie nothing gets in
the wav of that.
Athletes can look to then
tc.ims' S.TA R.'s lorsuppoit in
_matteis of peisonal and mtei
peisonal issues, substance
abuse, lelationslups, academ
ics, family issues, depiession,
eating disoideis, and a multi
tude of other issues with which
students must deal. Students
ortcn feel moie comfoi table
going to a peei with a pioblem,
but \\ a S TA.R. feels someone
else nuiv be more qualified to
help, he oi she can letei that

suiiLstu, the S "I \ R \ aic ie
i|iuicd io sponsoi one piogiam
which then teammates must

attend. In the past, the pro
grams have focused on study
skills and alcohol and drug
abuse, among other themes.
So, why S.T.A.R. Wars?
Lisa Beideman, a field hockey

S.T.A.R.,
believes,
"Star Wars
is a great
opportu
nity for all
of the ath
letes to get
together in
a little
healthy
competi
tion and
also to so¬

cialize at the same time. The
S.T.A.R.'s program provides
another venue besides coaches
and captains for athletes to go
to foi help, advice or just some
one to talk to."
A lot of people are un
aware of the S.T.A.R. program.
This program draws attention
to the assistance that is avail
able to every studentathlete,
because it may otherwise not
get recognized. Beideman
agrees that more should be
done to make athletes familiar
with this support group and to
"heighten participation and
enthusiasm."

Head Trainer Joe Donolh
said that the idea for S.T.A.R
Wars originated fiom an evalu
ation of the Student Athlete's
Assistance and S.T.A.R.'s pro
grams. He reported, "We
found that the teams in the ath
letics department did not really
know each other and that they
thought they were being
treated differently: 'I heard...,
we heard...'" Donolh and Barb
Streeter decided to bring the
athletes together to have some
fun and build unity within the
athletic department
Senioi Scott Grabus, a
S T.A R. for both the football
and ti ack teams echoed the sen
11mcuts of Beideman and
Donolh He said that it was a
good way for membeis of dir
feient teams to become ac
quainted. In addition, he said,
"It's a good way foi me to show

the United States and an active
member of the International
Club decided that she wanted
to try donning clothing from a
different culture. This decision
motivated her to model for the
show last year, and she plans
to model again this year.
Moses said, "I really
wanted to wear a san because I
thought it looked neat. I ended
up wearing a kameez instead,
but I do remember I had a lot
of fun getting all dressed up
and having Satwa do my
makeup and wearing her jew
elry and the beauty spot (bmdi)
in between my eyes. I remem
ber Nazn was very impressed
with all the women dressed up
in traditional Indian clothing.
Although the practices got to
be rather long and tiring at
times, it was worth it in the end
because we all knew how to
walk right and what to do with

our arms and facial expressions
to look professional." Moses
will get her chance to model a
sari this year.
Meanwhile, things will
continue to heat up as models
in the various sequences work
hard at choreographing and
practicing with their costumes.
For the first time, the models
are going to have a large screen
displaying scenery from then
native countries behind them as
they walk down the catwalk.
Kent Hinebaugh is organizing
the images.
The show promises to be
a staitlmg audio-visual experi
ence. It is definitely a must-see.
The enthusiastic Silveilieb
pointed out, "I'm expecting
that this year's show will KICK
SOME @$$, because we have
an awesome group of people
working together on it. We'll
do great!"

Cardboard Criticism: village not authentic

By Mary Fichtner
Contributing Writer
There is a name for this
scenario: sleeping under the
stars in down sleeping bags and
fleece pajamas, cooking chili on
hibachi grills, making s'mores,
and throwing a nerf football to
the sounds of Dave Matthews
on the CD player. It's called
camping.
It is not, on the other
hand, anything close to an
simulation of a night spent by
a homeless person. Last Thurs
day, I spent the night outside

Juniper Day and Meredith Ginn display their
temporary cardboard dwelling last Thursday
afternoon.

on Stine Lake along with other
students, in an effort to raise
awareness of the daily lives of
homeless people. Unfortu
nately, what was intended to be
a legitimate, philanthropic
event turned into a nighttime
college carnival celebrating our
so-called "ability to empha
size." I sat around, comfortably
dressed in my sneakers, two
fleece jackets, and waterproof
parka. I drank Servo-catered
hot chocolate, and I made
s'mores. Guilty as charged.
But something didn't feel right,
and a few of us stepped back at

one point and looked around "\Xe

ourselves.
We saw
people
wrapped
up in so

Students hang out by their cardboard home before spending the night for
Homelesfiness Awareness Week.

many lay-
ers with their heads on so many
pillows that the cold could not
possibly have penetrated.
Around 2 a.m., people
started to walk by on their way
home from parties. I felt em
barrassed. Here we lay,
bundled up in our own self
righteousness and cuddling
with our selt-congiatulations.
And if a person without a home
would witnessed the scene, I
would have been mortified.
The Cardboard Village
began as a good idea with le
gitimate backing. The event
took alot of tune and planning
by the Center for Public Service
and student voluntcei s. We did

laise some money for Habitat
h>i Humanity, and the hot
chocolate provided by Servo
was intended to imitate the
food and drinks provided by
shelters to some, but not nearly
all, of the homeless people in
cities. We, however, could
have, and should have, survived
the night without it.
Some of us learned a lot
fiom sleeping outside. By 3
a.m. I was cold, wet, and mis
ei. ible. But the night made an
impact Next year, perhaps we
can make an effort to sleep
without giant cardboard struc¬

tures around us, without stom
achs full of chips and hot
chocolate, and without the
comforts that we are lucky
enough to have every other
night of our lives.
In the future, I would like
to see this night repeated. But
the ridiculous display that oc
curred should never be dupli
cated. Next time, if on a Thurs
day night we want to make
ourselves feel better, let's watch
a movie or hit the bars. If we
want to make an impact, how
ever, let's do it right.

'he library is for studying.
Unsigned Dear Grumpy,
Libby thinks you must be
vl bit narrow-minded to think
chat a library is just a place for
books and studying. A library
\s a place where people come
_together and disciplines to in
tersect. Libby thinks a library
should be a cultural and intel-

ectual center on the campus,
lot some boring, morgue-like

losting the spectacular, spring

Unsigned
Dear Searcher,
Knouse is a renovated
warehouse behind the Ice
House Apartments. The li
brary uses part of this space to
store books and journals that
don't circulate very often. If
you find something with a lo
cation in Knouse you can place
a recall on it from the bottom
of the MUSCAT screen and
Libby wilJ retrieve it overnight.
You'll have it bright and early
the next morning.

cure a victory on the homefront

of war posters.
This lecture is made pos
sible through the Pennsylvania

Hearts to the students
who took the time to report
pages missing and torn from the
reference books. In the case of
the New York Times Index, the
pages were replaced in a flash
by the excellent inter-library
loan department. They got the
missing pages from another li
brary and inserted them in the
gap. Since the current New
York Times is online, everyone
was happy. The lesson? When
you can't find what you need,
ask at the reference desk!

Hearts to the students
who participated in the

fered a lot of good suggestions
about improving services and

who don't know enough to
stay m bed or go to the health

that you are sick but please try
not to spread it _abound.
Darts to everyone who
wants full text journals online,

how long it would take you to

A novel for "beach readers"

by Anne Schenck
Book Reviewer
Catherine Coulter. False
Pretenses. Rev. Ed. New York:
Signet, 2000. 393 pp.
This week's book, False
Pretenses by Catherine Coulter,
came right from our very own
College Bookstore. Although
the novel was originally pub
lished in 1988, I read the re
vised version, which apparently
means the book has a "stylishly
menacing new cover" and a
couple things have been up
dated, not rewritten. I have to
say the cover is kind of cool; I
think that's why I picked it up
in the first place. But I also
wanted something easy and fun
to read. Well, I got it. False
Pretenses is a no-brainer, an
easy-to-read suspense novel.

False Pretenses begins
with the trial of Elizabeth X (a
bit reminiscent of Jackie
O?). Elizabeth is the ,
window of wealthy busi- _^
ness magnate Timothy m_^
Carleton, and she is on _^H
trial for murdering her _^
husband with a silver ice _^H
pick (a weapon of choice _^^_J
among the wealthy, I _^H
suppose). _^^_J
Although she is ac- |^_J
quitted of his murder, ^^
her problems have just
begun. Elizabeth was a full 37
years younger than her million
aire husband, and no one in his
family either trusts her or likes
her. They contest the will, her
innocence, and just about ev
erything to do with her.
Laurerte Carleton, the family
matriarch, seems willing to
stop at nothing to avenge her
son's death and her reach into

Elizabeth's life goes far and
deep. Soon Elizabeth
doesn't know what or
_J~-* whom she can trust, and
I in order to save her own
I life and protect the es
I tate her husband left
I her, she must overcome
I her passivity and learn
I to play the game as
I sharply and shrewdly as
I everyone else. But
1 _^ naturally, she does"t do
any of this without first
taking on a few new lovers.
In the tradition of all
bestselling beach-reads, False
Pretenses provides page-turn
ing suspense without taxing
the mind. Some of the events
are predictable (even before
you open the book), and oth
ers come as a bit of a surprise,
but overall, the story sits well.
Despite the fact that she

however, it all works out and _Elizabeth proves she is well deserv

While I wouldn't force this book on anyone, it's not too
bad. With summer vacation only a month away, you might want
to put it on your "things to bring to the beach" list.

blues, and bluegrass. In the
last several years they have
gotten into the habit of creat
ing a theme for each concert,
as a way helping themselves
choose from a large repertoire
just which songs and tunes to
perform at a particular con
cert. In their fall concert, the
theme was "Folk Songs of
Work and Occupations."
By way of contrast, the
theme for Tuesday's concert
will be "Folk Songs of Leisure
and Indulgence." They will
accompany their lyrics with
banjo duets or banjo-guitar
duets in traditional styles.

Coming soon: eye-opening theatre production

By Carol Coon
Dept. Of Theatre Arts

Performer Jason
Jacobs will bring his one
man show "Poor Sport" to
Gettysburg College. Called
by The Orlando Sentinel, "a
funny, perspective look at
what it takes in our culture
to be a man," the show will
come to Stevens Theatre in
Brua Hall at 8:00 PM Fri.,
Apr. 14. Admission is free.
Sponsored by the Lec
ture and Performing Arts
Committee, the Depart
ment of Theatre Arts of
Gettysburg College and Al
lies, "Poor Sport"explores
the myth "that as a boy, if
you do not play sports, then
there is something wrong
with you" (The Central
Florida Advocate). The
show features a macho base
ball player pitted against a
non-athletic, artistic, gay
man and challenges the no
tion of sports figures as
American role models and
idols.

Directed by Jim Gaylord,
Jacobs was inspired to write the
play after a visit to a 1996 pho
tography exhibit at the Will
iams College Museum of Art,
and has since performed "Poor
Sport" in New York City, Or
lando and Los Angeles. He also
traveled to various high schools
and homes for troubled youths,
saying that those "perfor
mances have evoked especially
powerful responses." Jacobs
currently wishes to bring his
show to college audiences.
The Orlando Sentinel
further describes the result "a
provocative ... show that tran
scends the labels of gay,
straight, artist or athlete as it

engages us all.
Jacobs will also hold a
workshop Fri., Apr. 14 in
Stevens Theatre, from 2:00

Letters to the Editor

A father's words
Dear Emma,
I know that you're only three months
old, but like any father I'm con
cerned that I teach you the most im
portant lessons about life, and they say
that it's never too early to try to impart
values. Today I'd like to chat with you
(at you, rather) about the way the world
is, and about how you can try to make
it a little better through common cour
tesy and a sense of decency. I have three
main rules, and I hope that you'll learn
them and follow them:
1) Always try to do the right thing
(harder said than done, and you'll of
ten fail, which leads me to:)
2) Always apologize when you fail
to do the right thing, when you make a
mistake, or when you hurt someone
(whether you mean to or not, and

Suds in the fountain:
where is the humor?
You would think that students be
tween the ages of 18 and 22
would be mature enough to re
alize that putting detergent in the foun
tain is not mere entertainment, it is a
money and time consuming hassle. Our
Facilities Services staff has now spent
two full days returning our fountain to
working order. A genuine thank you
goes out to those people who have now
wasted two days to fix something that
was unnessesanly broken. I think it is
time for students to appreciate things
around here and learn to have a little
respect. We are all adults now; please
realize there are consequences to our
actions, and that somebody will have
to take responsibility for them. And to
whoever put the detergent in the foun
tain, I certainly hope you enjoyed those
suds. Maybe you should even act your
age and go apologize to our facilities
staff. See how funny they thought it
was. Sarah Calhoun '01

whether you think you're wrong or not;
and finally:)
3) Always, always, always take
responsibility for your words and ac
tions, whether they are a credit to you
or not.
The world can be a cruel and un
friendly place, and we all have to try
hard to make it a little better. I know
that you don't see things this way: right
now you know only love and adoration,
since everyone you meet falls down to
worship your beautiful blond-haired,
blue-eyed self. But your very appear
ance is representative of the many ad
vantages which are showered upon you,
although they are so much a part of the
fabric of your world that you might not
notice them at all, unless they were to
disappear: social class, educational
background, and race all count in this
world of ours, and it is an unfortunate
reality that many people are excluded

Suds: waste of time,
waste of water
I ain amazed at the fact that some
people on this campus have lost re
spect for our environment and the
people that work for the good of the
College. I think that most people would
agree with me when I say that I was
pleased to see the fountain up and run
ning again, but then to see that the very
next day members of Facilities Services
were taking time out of their busy
schedules to fix the mess that was made
by "super suds", disturbed me. Does
anybody realize that Gettysburg and the
surrounding area is still in a drought and
this mess caused 14,000 gallons of wa
ter to go down the drain. What a waste
of an important resource! I think that
we all should take this monstrosity into
consideration for our earth's sake and
remember the people who kindly fix the
recklessness of students on this campus.

Consider This

The fountain, which has remained empty for almost a year, was
finally refilled this past weekend. We were even able to enjoy its beauty
for a few days before it was once again emptied—this time, not due to
cold weather but to clean the mess made by someone pouring soap
into it.
It seems as though each time the fountain is turned on, some
I_»_r_*rv_>_o? i ¦ rr\ trr\r\n r\\r\i_^tr f^( /*\i i»* /_"_>_orvn_^i _ic* /^_nrv_^mi ¦ _nifi/

careless acts make that spending necessary.
How hard is it not to pour soap in the fountain every time it is turned
on? If you are really that attached to suds, buy some Mr. Bubble and
go play in your tub. Stop making the rest of us pay for your immaturity

feels the need to add soap. Perhaps the people
who perform such acts do not understand the
consequences of their actions. They only see
amusement and fun coming from a giant pile of
suds. If they really find this amusing, they
should go to Dolly's and watch the washing
machines run. At least the soap there is work
ing towards a decent goal.
The addition of soap to the fountain is a
complete waste of time, money, and resources.
Maintenance men had to sperfd two days of
their time cleaning the fountain out, time that
could have been much better spent beautifying
other parts of campus for Get Acquainted Day.
Thousands of gallons of water were wasted,
dumped out, unable to be used. Think of all
the money that was wasted paying hard-work
ing men to do a job that shouldn't have to be
done, buying water that could be used for more
essential things during the continuing drought.
Of course it is doubtful that the people who
pulled this prank really care about the money
spent to clean up from the mess they made.
These are undoubtedly the same people who
drive their SUVs to Servo for dinner, even while
gas prices hover around $1.50 a gallon. These
are the people who abandon eighty-page print
outs in the library and cannot walk to a recy
cling bin to dispose of their beer cans.

There are so many students who complain
about money management and unnecessary
spending at this College and yet among our
peers are a few individuals whose anonymous

Letters to the Editor

Hanson and
homelessness: a reaction
_- . :_ _ I ___^: I.., .
in sexual relationshiShe

Springer's letter precludes
proposed indusiveness

I would like to reply to two
things that appeared in last
week's Gettysburg/an: Ms.
Rachel Hanson's column "Ille
gal anti-choice violence endan
gers all parties involved" and
the "G-Burg Focus."
In regards to Ms.
Hanson's column: I am
alarmed by some of the statis
tics she presented. However,
even more disturbing is one of
the statistics she chose to leave
out. She informed us "that in
1999, 20 percent of abortion
clinics were victims of one or
more forms of extreme anti
choice violence, including
blockades, invasions, bomb

threats, bombings, arson
threats, arson, chemical at
tacks, death threats, [and] stalk
ing." I am truly bothered by
these figures. Although I am
pro-life, and believe that abor
tion clinics are nothing short of
death camps, I also believe that
people should not take the law
into their own hands, and
therefore I do not condone the
use of violence in order to shut
them down. However, I also
believe that more important
than the statistic above is one
that Ms. Hanson left out: ac
cording to the CDC, each year,
over 1.3 million children are
victims of extreme anti-life vio
lence, namely abortion.

In addition to this, I must
make one more point about
abortion. Many anti-life people
try to justify the killing of ba
bies by saying it is the woman's
choice. I agree that women
have a choice in the matter of
pregnancy, but their choice
comes at an earlier stage. Ex
cluding rape and immaculate
conception, the pregnant
woman had her choice when
she chose to become involved

a p.
knew the possible conse
quence, thus she must take ap
propriate responsibility for it,
and murdering the child is not
appropriate. Just because a
pregnancy may be an unwanted
burden resulting from an acci
dent, one cannot simply abort
it. For example: if someone hits
you with a car and is ordered
to pay your medical bills,
should he be allowed to have
you killed simply because you
are an unwanted burden result
ing from an accident? I think
not. Finally, in regards to an
unrelated issue, the "G-Burg
Focus" last week was absolutely
inane (it asked about
Homelessness Awareness
Week). Homelessness Aware
ness Week may make us feel
good, but it accomplishes little

if anything. Could someone
please tell me if building "card
board castles" on Stine Lake
helped any real homeless
people out of their situation? I
doubt it. Perhaps next year, if
students really want to make a
difference, they can invite
homeless people to stay in their
dorm rooms for a night. I do
not mean to make light of this
very serious situation. I do be
lieve homelessness is a genuine
problem in this country (I
should know; my father di
rected a homeless shelter for 16
years). I simply think that sleep
ing in a box for one night,
knowing one can go back to
one's warm bed and $30,000 a
year education the next day,
neither simulates real
homelessness nor does it bet
ter the situation of actual
homeless people.
Steve Cassarino '02

The letter of apology run
in last week's Gcttys
burgian from a member
of Phi Kappa Psi entitled "So
ghetto: the Greek perspective"
is a welcome effort on the part
of a fraternity that embarrassed
this community into redressing
a difficult situation. Unfortu
nately, the defensive tone of the
letter keeps it from being as
helpful as it might have been.
Indeed, the letter qualifies as
what Stanley Fish terms a "self
consuming artifact," a speech
act that undoes itself. The apol
ogy turns into an attack on Jus
tin Arnold; the writer, Jon
Springer, loses sight of the fact
that African American students
are very much owed an apol
ogy for an event does, despite
his denials, admit of being read
as having "degraded the collec
tive situation of members of a
minority."

Mr. Springer points out
that the party was not a "ghetto
party," but had as its theme
"Gangsters." This explanation
itself warrants comment, be
cause the figure of the gangster
in American life is, at least in
part, very much caught up in
ethnic stereotypes. Meyer
_Wolfsheim in The Great Gatsby
and Bernie Bernbaum (a.k.a.
"The Sheenie") in Miller's
Crossing, the gangstas of hip
hop, most of the members of
the Soprano family, and Rob
ert Shaw's Doyle Lonnegan in
The Sting are just some of the
more conspicuous presences in
a list of ethnically marked gang
sters that could probably be
extended indefinitely. One
wonders how many of the
styles of gangsterism parodied
at the party were drawn from
Jewish, Italian, Irish, Latino

and other stereotypes, and how
many were drawn from those
associated with African Ameri
can life. That Mr. Springer's
letter gives no actual examples
of exceptions to the rule Mr.
Arnold cited Is, while negative
evidence, revealing nonethe
less. Even accepting the claim
that the party was more about
gangsters than gangstas, one
might observe that fun had at
the expense of many groups is
every bit as curious as fun had
at the expense of just one.
The sad thing about Mr.
Springer's letter lies in its at
tempt to characterize Mr.
Arnold as a racist for his argu
ment that "young white Ameri
cans have no culture of their
own." Such a comment could
only be sparked, I should think,
by Justin's perception that the
party was thrown by a group

of young white Americans, and
that its theme included an at
tempt to characterize at least
one ethnic group as "the
other"—perhaps an "other" so
threatening as to warrant
mockery and caricature. Inten
tionally or not, Phi Kappa Psi
projected an image of itself as
a white organization, an ex
pression of white culture. If
that was the case—and again I
acknowledge that something
inadvertent may have hap
pened, that the impression may
not have been the one the fra
ternity intended to project—
Mr. Arnold would have had a
very good reason to offer his
perceptions of what that cul
ture looks like, to him. That
perception, not that I'm a soci
ologist, would seem to he valid,
if somewhat hyperbolically ex
pressed. The music that young
white Americans have favored

for the past fifty years is very
much indebted to blues and
jazz traditions that are African
American; the kids in the ad
vertisements who five years ago
declared enthusiastically that
they wanted to be like Mike
were not exclusively black. For
that matter, middle-aged En
glish professors who can't yet
bear to get rid of hair-styles
originally inspired by Julius
Erving have their own debt to
this tradition. Be that as it may,
perhaps there is an autonomous
white subculture, wholly unaf
fected by African American
contributions—if so, so much
the worse for it.
The line in Mr. Springer's
letter that most stands out is his
statement, "Stereotyping or
mocking any minority was not

our intention." It seems to me
that it is only possible to say
such a thing if minorities are
not already included in the
group that has the goodness to
refrain from such mockery. In
clusiveness would not seem to
be one of the things that Phi
Kappa Psi values; the lesser
value, if it can be called that,
of not treating the excluded
with utter disdain would seem
to be the best Mr. Springer's
letter can offer. Instead of dis
puting the accuracy of Mr.
Arnold's description of the cul
ture of young white Americans,
Mr. Springer might have writ
ten a more gratifying letter had
he been able to demonstrate
that there is no such thing as a
white culture, only an inclusive
American one, to which his fra
ternity proudly belongs.

On change, materialism and being institutionalized

by la. isherwood
Warrior, Patriot and
Scholar
"An unexamined life is not
worth living."
-Socrates
With any loss or separa
tion comes a degree of denial
and alienation. For many of us,
as these last few weeks wind
down before finals, this sense
becomes more apparent. The
average senior is, by this time
of year, in many ways just a
lame duck waiting in a shallow
pool for the time to come to
fly south. For others, depend
ing on how we finish our finals,
that flight may be hampered a
little by hunters in the form of
those professors waiting in the
wings to riddle our feathery
little shells with birdshot.

Many people are now
having horrible difficulties with
planning their lives from this

point on, and, myself included,
have a degree of anxiety. The
world is very interesting, and
for those of us not acquainted
with the rigors of management,
figuring out what to do with a
liberal arts degree is difficult.
I have recently found that the
best thing to come out of this
dilemma is a degree of soul
searching in these last few re
maining weeks. As I have al
ready stated, self-evaluation is
a critical part of the jigsaw
puzzle of life, and without it we
are mere shells of individual
ism, or rather the edges, of the
puzzle without any picture.
Many people spend the major
ity of their lives without know
ing what those last few remain
ing pieces are for, but at least
they keep searching. For the
vast majority though, they are
too busy deciding on what type
of Rolex to buy to really care.
Call this column a warning.
What I will warn against
is the excessive materialism as¬

sociated with our generation,
where a pay stub gradually
means happiness. Granted,
temporary pleasure can be
bought, but the lasting joy of
life, that beautiful marrow, is
an altogether different yet posi
tively attainable goal. Money
can't buy this, nor can a facade
of contentment built around
marriage, a Ford explorer and
two-point-five children all clad
in North Face gear (or for the
summer line: see expensive
ugly pseudo Hawaiian shirts
from Abercrombie). In reality
many people are perfectly
happy with this, well, until dad
decides at forty that his whole
life has been a lie and buys a
Camaro to take him as far away
from the family as possible.
This is a gross generalization
not meant to offend, but an ob
servation about a culture which
builds itself on materialism and
institutional walls made of plas
tic coated in the finest DuPont

waterproofing.
A friend pointed out to
me that we have been more or
less institutionalized our whole
lives; what is the point of jump
ing into yet another world
masked by the hefty regimen of
money? Happiness does not
come from feeling a part of
something, whether that some
thing is a club, Greek institu
tion or a cultural standard. If
anything, this world has too
many standards which have led
to complacency and a gross
feeling of alienation by whole
segments of our culture. Take
the Greek system as an example
of this. A campaign to encour
age rush by telling people that
all the great men of history
were Greek so you should be
too is a tool of propaganda
brought on by a system marked
by its own obvious insecurities.
I am not saying that these in
stitutions do not have their
place, but often they help en¬

courage a cultural standard that
leads to complacency of the
mind through a very homog¬

enous environment.
I disagree that these are
the best years of our lives, and
I challenge anyone who hon
estly can class any period of
anything as the best. If these
were the best years of my life,
then I sincerely hope that the
whole afterlife thing is true.
Life will not get worse, and it
will not become boring unless
you make it that way. It will
change, no doubt about that.
Things that were once impor
tant like drinking Natty's sweet
metallic taste will be replaced
by the joy of watching your son
or daughter hit their first inside
the park home run at a tee ball
match. All of the joy in the
world can be yours as long as
you, the thoughtful individual,
make it so.
There is no reason why
any of us should begin to plan
the rest of our lives out. This
takes all of the spontaneity out
of what should be an interest¬

ing existence. Most plans al
ways get f***ed up, and this
inadvertently leads to high
blood pressure, bowel discom
fort and possibly a nervous
breakdown for no real appar
ent reason other than anxiety
induced by this institutional
world of ours being turned up
side down. As I am leaving
soon, I feel the stress of all these
factors around me and I am
constantly being reminded of
the loss of these "best years".
All I can do is hope that fifty
years down the line my body
won't start eating itself because
of all the chemicals I have
forced into it during these best
years. Moreover, I hope that I
may possibly reach those high
standards to which I hold the
rest of the world. Then my
own blatant hypocrisy over
these last few years of writing
will be worth all of this search
ing. A part of my life now will
be slowly dying over these next
few weeks, only to be replaced
with something very strange,
fascinating and hopefully fruit
ful.

Advice
continued from page 11

from the advantages you enjoy
because of these factors. I hope
that you'll remember this fact,
and work both to address such
inequities and to be sensitive to
what your advantage means.
Every once in a while you
may be criticized for the advan
tages you enjoy, sometimes
fairly, and sometimes unfairly.
If such criticism is well
founded, please take it to heart,
and try to amend your ways.
If such criticism is unfair, that
stinks, and it hurts: it's wrong
for you to be judged on any
basis but that of your actions
and your character. Don't,
however, make the mistake,
little Emma, of comparing the
hurt you feel for such rudeness
with the disadvantage imposed
upon whole sectors of our so
ciety as a result of centuries of
institutionalized oppression
based upon appearance; the
former is simply rude, while the
latter we call racism.

I know that these are
complex ideas for such a little

girl, but hopefully this will all
be clear to you by the time that
you are old enough to vote;
that's why I'm taking the time
to talk to you about them to
day. I want to stay out of your
little scuffles as much as I may,
in order to give you the chance
to grow up into your own per
son. It is vital, however, that
this growth is nurtured in an
environment where we all treat
each other with respect and
dignity, and. where we all em
brace our responsibility for our
actions and disabuse ourselves
of the fiction that life is equally
fair to every little child. In such
an environment we_.can begin
to address those inequities
themselves, and perhaps then
you'll come of age in a better
world.

_Srom the Conservative Corner
Conservatism and the Declaration of Independence

by Dan Ballentyne
Columnist
Modern American con
servatism is one of the most
maligned ideologies today. Lib
erals spread lies of racism, big
otry, being for the rich, want
ing to kill people, etc. Fortu
nately, a wise man once defined
modern American conserva
tism in one elaborate sentence:
We hold these truths to be
self-evident: That all men are
created equal; that they are
endowed by their creator with
certain unalienable rights; that
among these are life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness;
that, to secure these rights, gov
ernments are instituted among
men, deriving their just pow
ers from the consent of the gov
erned.

The wise man was, of
course, Thomas Jefferson.
But what does this sen
tence mean? Well, I will take it
apart. I will start with "all men
are created equal." First off,

"men" in this case is both gen
der and race neutral. It refers
to all humanity. "Created
equal" is also a matter of dif
ference. As conservatives, we
believe that there should be
equality of opportunity, not
outcome. You should have the
right to do whatever you want,
within the law, but the govern
ment does not need to ensure
your success for two simple rea
sons. First, government can not
guarantee that you will suc
ceed. Second, and most impor
tantly, you can run your life
better than the government
ever could. Put even more sim
ply, conservatives trust you to
make the decisions best for
you. You know what is best for
you, not the government.
Next is the word "cre
ator." Conservatives are often
accused of wanting to establish
Christianity as a kind of offi
cial religion, but this is not so.
What we really believe is that
religion, as an idea and an in
stitution, is a good thing. The
basic principles of religion are

a healthy, pioductive thing.
Creator can refer to that of any
religion, not just the Judeo
Christian or Muslim God. Con
servatism is not about establish
ing a religion, but establishing
the religious freedom which
liberals have been fighting with
the removal of prayer from
school and attacks on the
Promise Keepers and other re
ligious organizations.
Next are our three un
alienable rights, "life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness."
Conservatives believe that all ot
us, born and unborn, have a
basic right to life. This does not
mean that capital punishment
is wrong. Over 35,000,000
American babies have been
killed in the last 25 years, and
liberals justify it with the argu
ment that the unborn b.iby is
somehow not human. The only
other time in human history
that mass execution occurred
with that excuse was the Ho
locaust. They also argue rlut
babies with birth defects .nt
being done a favor it they .ire

aborted. That is more or less
selective breeding, and again
the Na/is were the only people
with a eugenics program. The
innocent must be protected,
and the unborn are the most
innocent of all. The innocent
aie also protected by the death
penalty, as those who kill are
taken out of society perma
nently. Also, murderers have
taken human lives, and in do
ing so have forfeited their own
lives. Liberty and the pursuit of
happiness are very interrelated.
Liberty is the right to say what
you think, to worship as you
choose, to own a gun, to peti
tion the government for griev
ances, ere. The left has been
systematically infringing on our
rights, however. They now say
rh.it if you say something that
might be offensive, you have to
have psychological testing, as in
the case of John Rocker. Now,
I do nor condone anything he
said; what he said was wrong,
ih_.ir makes him dumb, not
cr.i/v. L.isr vear. OSHA at¬

tempted to enter our homes
and regulate what goes on in
them by saying it is an office if
you work there. They are at
tempting to ban guns in incre
mental steps, ignoring the fact
that gun control only leaves the
population defenseless against
criminals and against a govern
ment gone haywire, which was
not what the founding fathers
intended. They ignore the
people's demands for reforms
of social security, education,
lower taxes, and a renewed
defense, and instead dema
gogue and turn the oval office
into a disgrace.
The pursuit of happiness
is the right to decide what you
are going to do with your life,
how to run your family, what
career you want and so forth.
Our free enterprise capitalist
system, protected by our rights
of liberty guaranteed by the
Constitution, is the embodi
ment of the pursuit of happi
ness.

Term limits: no cause for an amendment

by John Dunlap
Political Columnist
Pennsylvania State Repre
sentative Todd Platts' win in the
19th Congressional District Re
publican Primary not only vir
tually assures his victory in the
general election this year, but
it also means that he could hold
this seat for ten to twenty elec
tions. Platts has everything
going for him. He is a young
Republican from an over
whelmingly Republican dis
trict. He is also from the geo
graphic powerhouse of the dis
trict, York. Representatives
from this district also seems to
enjoy long congressional ca
reers; consider that two mem
bers of the Goodling family
have controlled the district tor
38 of the last 40 years.
Todd Platts may not be a

bad congressman, I am sure he
will be fine, but should he or
anyone else be able to control
a seat for twenty to thirty
years? This brings up the ques
tion of term limits. In recent
years the desire for term limits
has reached its peak. States
across the nation have limited
their legislatures and governors
to two terms, and in 1994
countless members of Congress
were elected on a pledge to
limit themselves to three, four,
or six terms.
Now the debate over
term limits seems to have
calmed. In Washington, Re
publican Congressman George
Nethercutt, who defeated then
House Speaker Tom Foley in
1994 by pledging to serve only
six years in the House, is now
attempting to break his pledge.
Some would also argue that
Congressman J.C. Watts of

Oklahoma is doing the same
thing by running tor reelection
Term limitation was part of the
Contract with America, and
over 85% of Republican mem
bers have voted in favoi _ot a
constitutional limit on congres
sional terms. While I like the
idea on principle, and do teel
that congressional service
should be a caieer, in this case
a congressional amendment is
wrong.
The Piesidenr is one pei
son who holds a lot of powei.
In 1948 the nation was i lght to
limit presidential terms, bur
Congress is different. Aftei
serving as a page in the House
of Representatives, I came to
appreciate the diversity of Con
gress. It was great to have so
many freshman members in
1995, but it was also great to
listen to and learn from great
leaders like Henry Hyde ot Il¬

linois who lias been _^H
in the House since _^
1967. In the Senate, the
lustoiy that fills the cham
ber is awesome.
The President Pro Tein
pore, Stiom Thurmond of
South Carolina, the longest
seiving member in Senate his
toiy, is an 'nstitfcion who re
membeis and knows things that
younger members cannot imag
ine. The same is tine for Daniel
Pati ick Moynihan of New York
and Jesse Helms of North
Carolina. They, along with the
youngei members like Rick
Santoium of Pennsylvania and
Blanch Lambert-Lincoln of Ar
kansas, come together to make
the Congie.ss work.
While, I sympathize with
those who oppose the en
trenched incumbent, a consti
tutional amendment goes too
tar and presents a big i lsk. I

sun
p 1 y
want to have the right to vote
for or against Congressman Bill
Goodling or Bud Schuster. I
agree with Jack Kemp, who af
ter eighteen years in the House
said that he was a much better
Congressman the second half
of his congressional tenure than
the first, and as one of his con
stituents I would have been
angry to lose either Kemp or
Henry Hyde. If we want to
defeat incumbents we should

Columnist
On Tuesday, Dr. Deborah
Lipstadt, a professor from
Emory University, won a libel
suit against Dr. David Irving, a
British historian. Dr. Irving
charged Dr. Lipstadt with libel
after she published her book

tvom the Donkey's Month
On denying the
Holocaust

Denying the Holocaust: The
Growing Assault on Truth and
Memory.
In the book, Irving is de
scribed as a "Holocaust de
nier." A British court agreed
with Lipstadt and dropped the
libel suit. What remains is un
believable. There exists a
growing amount of people—
including scholars and politi
cians— who deny that the Ho
locaust happened.
Irving maintains that the
Auschwitz death camp was
built after the war by Polish
communists to attract people
who were intrigued by the so
called Holocaust myth. Irving
went so far as to call Auschwitz
a "kind of Disneyland for tour
ists." The most horrific death
camp that was ever in existence
is an amusement park?

It's hard to believe that
people have the guts to utter
such statements, but Irving did
not stop there. He claims that
most of the people who died
in the camps died of typhus or
some other disease, not in gas
chambers, because Irving be
lieves that there were not any
gas chambers at all.
He denies that Hitler
even developed a "final solu
tion to the Jewish question."
He goes so far as to question if
six million Jews really did die
in the concentration camps.
Irving defends his cause by say¬

ing that he alone is telling the
truth and that those who de
fend the Holocaust are actually
building a myth.
He believes that Jews
have built the story of the Ho
locaust to make their persecu
tion "more unique" than any
other persecution story in his
toiy. Irving has been banned
horn going to Germany be
cause of his denial of the Ho
locaust. He has also been le
stncted fiom entenng Canada,
Australia, Austua and Italy for
the same leason He also be
lieves that this libel suit is just
another way the conspiracy of

people who believe that the
Holocaust occuired are trying
to Him his professional caieei.
The fact that I can even
write such an article about .1
person like David Irving is
mind blowing. How can
people deny the fact that the
Holocaust happened less than
sixty years ago? The facts sup
port that the Holocaust did in
deed happen How could Pol
ish communists built the
"Disneylands" that we know as
death camps after the war when
the Allies liberated the camps
in 1945?
If the camps weie not as
bad as people said they weie,
why were the prisoners the Al
lies found starving, bald, and
emaciated to the point that they
looked like the living dead?
Why are there survivors with
numbers tattooed on their hue
arms? Why do people like Ehe
Weisel travel the woi Id talking
about their experiences in the
death camps?

Is The Diary of Anne
Frank a work of fiction? Did
the United States government
spend money to build a mu
seum about a myth? Hoi ev
eryone who ever saw the docu
mentary SHOAH, were those
people who were interviewed
lying about their experiences '
Is Oskar Schindler a figment of

And, most importantly, wheie

I would like Di living to

Ban on late-term abortion
holds more than
meets the eye

my RACHfci Hanson
Coiumnim
Last Wednesday, the
House of Representatives ap
pi oved a ban on late-term abor
tions—so called "partial-birth
abortion" by choice opponents.
The bill was passed 2S7 to 14 J,
which is a wide enough mar
gin to override President Bill
Clinton's piomised third veto
on such legislation. It ib also
expected that the ban will pass
in the Senate, but will not be
able to have enough support to
override Clinton's veto.
This ban is nothing but a
disguised attempt to revoke
women's rights to any abortion
procedure. The reasoning be
hind having such a law is
Hawed, and when the facts
about late-tenn abortions are
examined, it seems obvious
what anti-choice people are
leallv attempting to do here.

injury " These are the only
times that late-term abortions
are being performed now!
So, an appropriate ques
tion here would be: "what is
this debate about, then?" It is
reajly quite simple. The debate
is about people trying to take
away women's constitutional
rights to reproductive choices
through a ban that is hidden
behind a different term. A rose
by any other name is still a rose.
This late-term abortion ban is
really an attempt to end access
to all forms of abortion.
The wording of this ban
is the first clue as to what is

really going on here. Nowhere
in the ban does it mention
stages of pregnancy. Therefore,
this could easily apply to abor
tions at every stage of preg
nancy, making it illegal for a
doctor to perform any abortion
unless it was necessary due to
physical danger for the woman.
Also, according to NOW,
"proponents of [this ban] ad
mit they intend to limit or
eliminate access to all abor
tions." These people really are
not even trying to hide what
they are in fact doing—over
turning Roe v. Wade in a sneaky
and underhanded way.

I will admit that late-term
abortions are not pleasant (not
that any sort of abortion really
is) and should be rarely used.
In tact, they are already done
only in extreme cases. Accord
ing to the National Organiza
tion for Women (NOW), "only
foui one-hundredths of one
percent of legal abortions are
pei formed during the third tri
mestei |and| over )5 percent
of all aboitions are performed
dunng the fust 15 weeks of
piegnancy." Also, late-term
aboitions aio currently only
used in _extiume cases where
the mothei's life is in dangei
Keeping this inroi ination
in mind and looking at the ban
111 question, it seems that this
ban is pointless, and the whole
debate o\ ei it is a waste of time
I he ban includes a clause stat
ing that a late-tei 111 abortion
uin be used it ir "is necessaiy
to save the life _ot a mothei
whose lift is endangeied by a
phvsital disoidei, illness, 01

Similar bans on late-term
abortions that have already
passed 111 states have proved to
have detrimental effects. For
example, after Wisconsin
passed a ban on late-term abor
tions, every women's health
clinic in the state subsequently
stopped offering any abortion
services.
It seems that this ban re
ally would not have much of
an effect on abortion rights
because late-term abortions are
aheady rarely done. However,
it is blatantly obvious that
should a ban like this ever be
come law, women may find
themselves having to become
cnminals 111 order to have any
soit of abortion.

of 117*8".
Catlett scored 6 points in
the 1500 meter run with a
third-place finish in 4:05.62.
He came back to finish fifth in
the 5000, running a personal
bestof 16:03.0 in weather that
left every athlete soaked to the
core and sent spectators run
ning for shelter.
The Bullets got a slew of
points in the field from the
hammer throw, led by first-year
Christian Noll's second-place
effort (1377"). Seniors Scott
Grabus and Gene Kraus fin
ished fourth and sixth with
throws of 124*6" and 121*6",
respectively. Combined with
Williams's seventh place finish,
the event provided Gettysburg
with 18 points.
Junior Will Hannema
added a fourth place finish in
the pole vault, clearing a height
of 12-6, and sophomore Chris
Russo's sixth-place high lump

-continued from page 24
of 6*00" wrapped up scoring in
the field.
On the track, first-year
hurdler Chris Buchanan placed
in both hurdle events, running
15.82 in the highs to rake
fourth and 61.83 to finish
eightin the intermediates.
Ryan Foster finished sixth
in the 200 (23.22) as junior
Jeff Cumpson and first-year
Phil Ferarro took the sixth and
seventh spots in the 400, run
ning 51.86 and 51.62, respec
tively. In the 800, the Bullets
got sixth and eighth places
from first-year Ron Francis
(2:10.2) and sophomore Bill
Smith (2:10.9).
In the distance events,
sophomore Evan Merkhofer
dropped his PR in the 1500 for
the third time this season to fin
ish fourth behind Catlett in
4:12.86. Junior Jason Rose
picked up a sixth place in his
first 10,000 metei race with at

a time of 35:11.79.
Both of the men's relays
performed well, as the 4\1 0()
of (??) took third in 43.84 and
the 4x400 of Ferarro,
Cumpson, and juniors Nick
LaPorta and J.T. Farrell fin
ished second in 3:29.34.
Noll and Merkhofer were
both awarded the Silver Spike
for their performances in the
meet. Although times and dis
tances were greatly affected by
the adversecondinons, both
teams competed well and are
clearly working toward an out
standing performance at the
conference meet at the begin
ning of May.
Both the men and women
defeated perennial conference
rival Dickinson at Messiah, and
they look to do so again when
they host the Mason-Dixon In
vitational at Musselman Sta
dium this Satin day.

Baseball

continued from pave 23

and he dishes out less hits than
Chumbawumba.
As a result of the tough
opposing pitching, the offense
has been faltering. Losing close
games i.s not the how this jug
get _naut or offensive productiv
ity used to work. The team
used to get outscored 15-13 or
12 10. Now, the pitching and
defense come together and the
offense sputters. That is base
ball, that is how the game is
played.
Not to be overlooked by
the lough terrain, ftus been the

great pitching of Tom Boob,
who threw 7 innings of two hit
ball in a loss to Ursinus. Fresh
man Matt Donohue continues
to pitch well too, giving up only
4 runs in the second game
against Ursinus.
Don't go running for the
exits just yet folks. There is still
a lor of baseball to play and
many more roads to challenge.
The cracked, broken, and
dented Chevy Pickup still has
a bunch of miles left in it, and
won't stop running until the
road has run out.

hie these days, caiiymg a
seven-game winning stieak af

cis List week. The Bullets took
two games from 1999 Division
III World Series participant
Messiah on Thin sday and then
lolled to victones ovei
_Haverfoul on Satin day and
Dickinson on Tuesday. With
the help of excellent pitching
anil solid offense, the Bullets
have proven to be a foice to be
leckoned with against both
Centennial Confeience and
non-conference foes.
The Bullets walked into
the Messiah series with the
weight of an eightgame losing
stieak to the Falcons on their
back. Gettysburg was able to
hand Messiah not one, but two,
defeats, behind the solid pitch
ing of sophomore Couitney
Todd and |iinior Sarah Stokes
and senioi K.nyn Miller's key
offensive contributions

Todd fired her thud shut
out of the year in the game I,
allowing 5 hits in 7 innings as
the Bullets won, 4-0 She never
let a runnei past second base
at any point in the game.
Gettysbuig scored the
only run it would need in the
first inning, as Millei diove
fust-year Jenna Pabst home
with a single. The Bullets
picked up three insurance inns
m the thud inning with RBI
singles fiom sophomore Megan
Wai go and |umoi Casey
Stevens, but the Falcons nevei
answeied the Bullets' offense
and the Bullet losing srreak was
snapped.
Gettysburg lode this vic
toiv into game two and walked
away with a 5-2 win to sweep
Messiah in style. This time,
Stokes notched the victoiy toi
the Bullets with the help of se
nior Melissa Ha/._zard, who got
the final six outs of the game
to eai n her second save of the

season.
Gettysburg fell behind 2
I early in the game, but came
to life in the fifth inning as
Miller sl.immcd a triple into left
field to drive junior Jen White
in to score the tying run.
W.iriio quickly pulled the liul-

lets ahead foi good with an RBI
single that plated senior pinch
luntiet Jody Noel.
Gettysbuig then traveled
to Haverfoid for some mter
confeience play on Saturday.
Todd and Ha//aid each picked
up wins to help the Bullets ex
tend their winning streak to
five. Todd pitched superbly to
secure a 4-0 shutout of the
Fords, striking out 4 batteis and
allowing just 3 hits.
The game started out
shakily, as Haverford put run
ners on second and third in the
first inning, but Todd was able
to get out of the jam and the
Fords never threatened Gettys
burg again.
Gettysburg's offense had
warmed up by the third inning,
as Wargo's double in the third
inning plated Miller and
sophomore Mandy Wilson to
knock in the first two runs of
the game. Wargo and Millet
each chipped in RBIs in the sev
enth inning to ensure the vic
toiy.

The Bullet offense was on
fire in game two, as the Bullets
scored m each of the first three
innings before going on to a 7
1 victory.
Miller doubled home
Wilson in the first and third
innings while junior Emily
Boardman drove in first-year
Stef Mastropaolo with an RBI
single in the second frame.
Miller's second double of the
game in the sixth capped off a
four-run sixth inning that gave
the Bullets all the lead they
needed. Hazzard pitched all
seven innings for the Bullets, al¬

lowing just one hit while strik
ing out 4 to back Gettysburg's
offense.
Miller and Todd were
both named to the Centennial
Conference Honor Roll for
their outstanding performances
through the course of the week.
Todd, however, was just
getting stai ted. Her brief ca
reer at Gettysburg has been il
lustrious, but one thing has
eluded her—a no-hitter. How
ever, she was able to add this

and constant support. She also
credits much of her success to
Coach Condon. "He's an ex
cellent coach, and he has taught
me a lot about running. He's
not only a coach, but also a

But Andi's love for her

pursuing many other activities.

Although some meets
have left her disappointed, she
has always tried to maintain
positive energy.
"Andi is goal driven and
enjoys winning, but I have
never seen anyone walk away
from a defeat with such grace.
Instead of lamenting defeats or
lost goals, she moves ahead and
looks forward to the next com

Andi confides that she has
mixed feelings about her up

The players many aches
keep her busy, and she admits
that running sometimes takes a
backseat during the fall. Such
a laid-back approach coming
from successful runner may
sound surprising until one
hears about all of her other ob

This year, Andi has served
as the Student Athletic Trainer's
Club president. She has also
participated in Hall Govern

Although her competitive

that she will continue running

one of the most talented stu

Baseball hits rough road
after 0-3 week

Steve Jenkins
• Staff Reporter
Okay. SothePorshe911
that was once the Gettysburg
College Baseball team, now re
sembles a 1985 Chevy Pickup.
The windshield is cracked, the
hood is dented, and the engine
is coughing, but the wheels
must keep turning. I mean look
at the competition. In the Bul
lets most recent game versus
Johns Hopkins, the Bullets gave
up 18 runs, on close to the
same number of hits. I
wouldn't have mattered if
Woods had gone deep twice, or
Lunardi had 3 triples; an 18
spot is hard to handle.
And the Bullet pitchers
aren't to blame. The game of
baseball is a really simple thing.

You hit, you throw, and you
catch. On some days, the other
team hits throws and catches
better than you do, and for
Hopkins this was one of those
days. Hopkins belted homers,
doubles and singles that were
never a doubt. They really had
no cheap hits; no texas-leagu
ers, no bloop singles; just pure
and simple hitting. Something
that the Bullets just haven't
done. In their curtent three
game losing streak, the Bullets
have a grand total of 3 runs.
I'm not a mathematician, or a
statistician, but one run per
game isn't going to produce a
lot of wins.
In the last two games ver
sus Ursinus, the Bullets man
aged just eight hits in two
games, scored no runs, but only

lost 1-0, and 4-0. In the Cen
tennial Conference, four luns
in a game is going to give you a
chance to win most of the time.
The competition is pretty even,
if you play solid defense, pitch
well, and hir well, you always
give your team a chance.
You all may be thinking,
"Well gee, thanks Captain Ob
vious. Your telling me if I play
well I win." My answer to your
thoughts are, it is not as easy
as it sounds.
In the first game versus
Ursinus the Bullets had to face
pitcher Matt Wiati ak. The guy
has five wins, and a left aim
that drops as much |imk as a
leaky trash truck. Then, you
see number two pitcher Kyle
Goldwater in the second game,

them fust m the Centennial
Conreience.
Last Wednesday, the Bul
lets entered a nun conference
matchup with St. Maiy's Col
lege in Maiyland. Sophomore
Beck) Bucha staittd the seen ing
with two goals in a low to ini
tiate the lead the Gettysburg
took roi the afternoon.
Next, hist-year Katie
Mernken found the net off a
pass from senior Amy
Stambaugh. The Seahawks an
swered with a single goal, which
was countered by two more
horn Srambaugh.

Junior Lynsey Waid
sailed one between the pipes as
the Bullets left the field with a
half-time lead of 6-2.
|usr minutes into the sec
ond half the Seahawks slammed
thiee goals by Gettysbiug's de
fense to tie the game at 6-5.
Howevei, m a toui teen-second
window, Bucha and Stambaugh
fought back to again put Get
rysbmg on top, 8-5.
With this spark, the Bul
lets continued to hammer the
Seahawk defense and clinch the
game, 14-7.
With the Bullets hot on
the Centennial Conference title
hunt, they met Swarthmore on
Satuiday at Memorial Field.
Stambaugh and Bucha set the
tone m the first eleven minutes
of the contest by racking up two
goals apiece.

Swaithmoie tightened up
then defense and found the cage
twice to lower the spread, but

first-year Megan Murphy an
swered the call with a goal, fol
lowed by Stambaugh's third of
the day. At half-time the score
stood at 6-2.
Sophomore Anna
Haugen took charge in the be
ginning minutes of the second
half with a goal of her own and
an assist to teammate
Meinken.
After a quick goal by
Swarthmore, Haugen found
the cage again off an assist
from Bucha and she later
topped off her hat trick for the
day. The Bullets had claimed
this game 11-5 by the last
whistle.
On Tuesday, Gettysburg
faced Dickinson, another Cen
tennial Conference opponent.
After 6 minutes of scoreless
play, Stambaugh initiated the
scoring, followed by a goal
from Junior Susie Mitchell and
another from Haugen. By half
time the game was in favor of
Gettysburg, 6-1.

The Bullets opened the
second half with a quick goal
from Meinken. After one
slipped by junior goalie
Michelle Centiella, Stambaugh
hit the bulls eye, followed by a
netter by senior Lisa Beideman.
At this point the Bullets
led the game, 8-2. After a two
goal run by the Red Devils,
Gettysburg fired in five more
goals to secure a 15-5 victory.
Senior Kim Fernandez made
two of these goals.
Through the course of
the week, Centrella recorded
38 saves, aided by the stellar
defense of junior Jessica
Seedorf.
The 9th ranked Gettys
burg Women's Lacrosse team

Conference opponent Bryn
Mawr.

Andi Therit: Lightning and
Leader on the Track

Allison Smai i
Stafi- Writer
- Many track record-hold
ers credit their success to their
_intenselycompetifive drive or
grueling yeai-round training
workouts. Others depend on
their elaborate pre-race rituals
for their winning edge. An
drea Therit understands how
others might benefit from
these tactics. She, however,
enjoys a much more easy-go
ing approach to her sport.
And judging by the success
she's experienced in her deco
rated track career, Audi has
mastered her method.
Andi, a senior Health
and Exercise Science major
from nearby Littlestown, Pa.,
has acted as captain of both the
indoor and outdoor track
teams for the past three years.
She holds the college recoids
for the indoor 200m race
(27.31) and runs with the
record holding 400m and
1600m relay teams.

Her name appears sec
ond on the all-time
perfomance lists in both the
outdoor 100- and 200-meter
dashes with times of 12.34 and
25.57, respectively Hei
coaches have selected hei as
two-time MVP, and she holds
the 1998 Conference Cham
pion title for the 100 meter
dash and the 2000 Conference
Champion title in the 4x400
meter relay.
Besides acting as captain
of both the indoor and out
door track teams this year,
Andi works as one of the
team's S.T.A.R. volunteers.

According to Coach
Robert Condon, Andi is truly
an asset to the team.
"While others may be
noted for an outstanding act
of sportsmanship, her behav
ior is consistently sportsman
like, day in and day out. The
fact that she is universally re
spected by the coaches and the
athletes of other teams cer
tainly supports this," he says.
Condon recalls one meet
at which he saw Andi "correct
an official at the finish line
when he picked her ahead of
someone she knew she had lost
to." Condon says that she al¬

ways shares her best wishes with
both teammates and opponents
before her races. At the end of
each race, "she is the first per
son to congratulate them," he
adds.

Andi's love for running
began early. Both her father and
older sister ran, and they en
couraged her to run with them.
Because she has ")ust always
liked running," she joined a
summer running league after
she finished sixth grade, which
kept her active until she entered
high school.
She ran on her high school
team for four years, and she
chose to continue when she en¬

rolled at Gettys'buig.
Judging by her impres
sive iecord, one might he
tempted to think that Andi
simply urns because she enjoys
hei own success. But this is

far from the truth.
According to Audi, the
"constant camai adene" di aws
her to the .sport. "It's such a
unique team. I love it because
the girls and guys work out to
gether, have team meetings to
gether, and travel to meets to
gether. We're all one big fam
ily," she says.
She enjoys hei team

After last week's heart
breaking loss to Salisbury State,
the men's lacrosse team re
bounded with two wins that
displayed their true focus.
Winning the Centennial Con
ference is still among the team's
objectives, and with two con
ference wins this past week
over Haverford and Western
Maryland, the Bullets look like
they are intent on that goal.
Last Wednesday the Bul
lets took on the Haverford
Fords at Musselman Stadium in
the conference season opener.
The Bullets won the game with
solid play as they defeated
Haverford with a 20-4 assualt.
The Bullets are now 16-0 all
time versus Haverford, and the
win notched their 17th con
secutive conference victory.

Gettysburg wasted no
time taking control of the game
as they jumped out to a 4-0
lead. The Fords never could
quell the Bullet attack and get
back in the game. The Bullets
had an 11-2 lead at halftime
and then shut out the Fords, 6
0, in the third quarter, to ex

one, striking out 8 while
allowing just one runner to
reach base on a walk.
Near-perfection turned
to be just what the Bullets
needed, as the offense was only
able to secure one run to back
Todd. The run came in the first
inning as Wilson drove Pabst in
on a fielder's choice.
In game 2, the offense
game back to life, led by
White's 2-for-3 performance
with two runs scored and a
double. They scored four runs
to support Stokes, who allowed

just one run and two hits on the
afternoon to secure a 4-1 vic
tory over the Red Devils.
The Bullets 7-1 confer
ence record places them second
in the conference. Wilson leads
both her team and the confer
ence in batting with a .533 av
erage, and her 8 stolen bases
also stand at the top of the con
ference. Todd, Hazzard, and
Stokes lead the CC in pitching
with ERAs of 0.00, 0.58, and
0.60 respectively. Behind these
key players, the Bullets look to
capture this year's Centennial
Conference crown.

Women's Track &c Field cream of the crop at Messiah

Schenck leads Lady Bullets to first place; men third behind Williams and Catlett

Lauren Davis
Assistant Sports Editor
They were cold. They were tired.
They were wet. And still they ran and
threw and jumped and vaulted their way
to top-three finishes at the Messiah In
vitational.
So goes the story of the Bullet
track 8c field team's performance on
Saturday. The women won their first
meet of the year behind senior Anne
Schenck's three gold medals and one
silver. They collected 136 points on the
day, crushing second-place Messiah to
avenge their early-season loss to the
Falcons.
On the men's side, senior Mike
Williams and junior Jon Catlett each
scored in a pair of events to help the
Bullets pick up 84.5 points and finish
behind first-place Susquehanna and a
single, heart-breaking point away from
Messiah.
The early hours of the meet were
clear and warm, and Schenck capital¬

ized on the weather. She picked up the
first 10 of her 38 points on the clay in
the high jump with a height of 5' 2".
Then she moved to the long jump,
where she leapt 16' 8 1/4" to finish sec
ond, just a quarter of an inch out of
first place.
Schenck finished the day on the
track, running 12.62 in the 100 to cap
ture gold. The weather took a turn for
the worse during the final events of
themeet, and in spite of drenching rain
and a strong headwind she ran 25.92
in the 200, just .03 seconds of her PR,
to win her final event of the day.
Sophomore Kristin Roberts
scored the Lady Bullets' only other vic
tory of the day. Roberts took the lead
early in the 5000 and held on for the
win in a time of 18:36.22, a personal
record that moved her to fourth on
theBullets' all-time performance list.
The captains awarded her the Silver
Spike for her efforts.
Senior captain Andi Thent was
not far behind Schenck in the
sprints,finishing second in the 200

(26.61) and
third in the
100 (12.83).
Junior Eileen
C h a z a n
marked her
return to the
track with a
fifth-place
finish in the
200 (27.89),
and the Bul
lets got their
final points
in the open
sprints from
first-year
Joanna Sliver
and junior
Ken Hymen.
Silver ran
60.12 inthe
400 to pick
up a silver
medal, fol
lowed by Hy
men, seventh
in 62.56.
First
year Melissa
H o 11 m a n ,
sophomores
Abby Jackson
and Lauren
Davis, and

junior captain Kelley Lord added to
Roberts's 10 points in the distance
events. Hollman finished fourth in the
10,000 in 43:00.03, followed by Lord
(sixth in 44:33.63) and Jackson (seventh
m 45:31.66). Davis contributed a hfth
place finish in the 1500 with a time of
5:04.41.
The Lady Bullets also got points
on the track from senior Erika _j_^urst,
fourth in the 100 hurdles in (16.8 1).
Senior Cathy Spangler led the
throwers in the field with a silver in the
shot put (37'1 ""), a bronze in the dis
cus (100' 9"), and a fifth-place finish in
the hammer throw (1 lO'l 1"). First-year
Colleen Bruce finished seventh behind
Spangler in the shot (35'4"), while class
mate Lara Knudsen finished seventh in
the javelin (101'9").
First-year Katie Diehl cleared

8'00" in the pole vault to take fourth
place and wrap up the Bullets' scoring
m the field.
In the relays, Gettyburg's 4x100
team of Them, Silver, Schenck, and
Hymen finished third in 50.55. The
Lady Bullets finished off the meet in
style, as the 4x400 relay of Therit_, Hy
men, Hurd, and Silver captured gold in
4:07.73, a remarkable time considering
the rain and wind that intensified as the
meet continued.
On the men's side, Williams led
the throwers with a third place finish
in the shot put (42'10") and a fourth
place throw of 132'00" in the discus.
He also picked up a pair of points
in the hammer throw with a distance
