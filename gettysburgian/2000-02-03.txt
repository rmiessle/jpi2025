This week, Information Re

IR chose to deny access to
this type of non-academic
program because of multiple
complaints regarding the
sluggishness of the network.
Several students re
sponded to the removal of
this program, including first

year student Nathan
Stazweski, who responded
via the daily email digests.
"When things like voice
mail came into place, we
had charges tacked right
onto our bills. Now they
take something away. Are
they going to reduce the ex
pense of going to this col
lege?" asked Stazweski. He
added, "Remember, we're

fered with academic related programs
such as search engines used for re
search. Musselman Library also ex
perienced computing problems.
Hayden, in an email issued to

sons. Students used Napster with
greater frequency than any other non
academic program. Last week, at its
highest point, Napster occupied 30
percent of the network's Internet

students, indicated that IR would con
tinue making the changes necessary to
ensure the availability of academic re
lated programs. When asked to elabo
rate upon this statement, he replied,
"It is our responsibility to ensure that
the core missions of the cam¬

pus always have the appropri
ate level of network capacity.
IR will continue to monitor
network health and respond in
an appropriate manner, after
considering options appropri
ate to the situation."
Both Martys and Hayden

stated that they understand the
student response; however,
they assert that academic pro
grams must take precedence
over non-academic ones.
Currently, the College
plans to increase its network
capacity, install special net
work appliances that will regu
late network traffic and imple
ment better management tools
that will monitor and antici
pate problems. These mea
sures will be taken to retain the
College's status as the 8th most
wired campus in the nation.

Gettysburg College is not
alone in banning the use of Napster to
conserve bandwidth, Oregon State
University as well as Northwestern
University have also shut down access
to Napster.

Class of 2000 prepares to
"Make its Mark"

From Brian Allen
Annual Giving Officer
The Class of 2000 Senior
Scholarship Program Commit
tee announced its campaign for
the Senior Scholarship Prize
Fund by distributing kickoff
packets to all seniors on Tues
day, February 1. The Senior
Scholarship Prize Fund is an
endowment started by the
Class of '96.
Enhanced by gifts from

each senior class since 1996, the
endowment's interest generates
scholarships awarded annually
to two rising seniors (one man
and one woman) based on aca
demic excellence and extracur
ricular involvement.
The Class of 2000 recipi
ents were Daniel Sirpenski and
Emily Robertson. Jennifer
Wells and Paul Koether, Class
of 2000 Senior Scholarship
Committee co-chairs, will an
nounce 2001 recipients at Com
mencement ceremonies in May.
At the official Senior

Scholarship Kickoff, which
will be held in conjunction
with the Senior Party on Sat
urday, February 12, the Com
mittee will unveil this year's
theme, "Making Our Mark."
"We chose this theme be
cause the year 2000 marks the
beginning of a new millennium
and a great year for the Class
of 2000 to make our mark,"
explain the co-chairs.
The Committee will also
formally announce the class
goal of $20,000 with 50 per
cent participation. The Com
mittee feels confident that it
will make this goal, despite the
lateness of the campaign kick
off. As Wells and Koether ex
pressed it, "Reflecting upon
our 'Gettysburg Experience,'
we feel confident that every
senior will be willing to sup
port this effort to reach our
class goal."

To help the class reach its
goal, the Committee, which
consists of six executive mem
bers _anrl Ampna of other se-

niors, will take pledges and an
swer questions in the CUB
lobby every other week from
Tuesday through Thursday, be
ginning the week of February
1. Seniors can also make
pledges by completing and de
taching the pledge card they
received in their packets, which
also included a Gettysburg Col
lege 2000 Calendar.
These limited-print calen
dars, typically reserved for do
nors to the Annual Fund, were
given to seniors by the Office
of Annual Giving.
"The calendars are our
way of saying congratulations
to the seniors for all their hard
work and for the contributions
that they have made to this
campus over the past several
years," commented the Annual
Giving Officer. "We hope that
they will continue to share that
sense of giving by supporting
the Senior Scholarship and, in
turn, supporting the future of
two rising seniors."

College develops technological tool for
advising with Hewlett grant

"Homefront USA"
series features jazz talk

From GCPR
Gettysburg College
graduates may soon be armed
with a new tool for landing a
job or applying to graduate
school. By using the College's
new Personal Plan and Portfo
lio system, students can build
an electronic portfolio of their
activities and accomplishments
as college students.
"This technology tool
will give students a way to
present their college experi
ence well beyond a transcript,"
said GailAnn Rickert, associate
dean and director of academic
advising. "It will allow them
to gradually and systematically
compile information and de
velop an electronic portfolio
that they can tailor to their spe
cific needs."

The Personal Plan and
Portfolio system, developed by
the College and funded
throueh a erant by the William

and Flora Hewlett Foundation
of California, encourages stu
dents to assume responsibility
for their own learning and to
strengthen the advising process
that occurs between students
and faculty.
"By providing students
with tools that help them take
ownership of their education,
time spent with faculty advi
sors will presumably be more
effective and rewarding for
both advisees and advisers,"
said Abby Scholer, a senior
from Pasadena, Ca., who is a
member of the team of stu
dents, faculty and administra
tors spearheading the project.
"When students articu
late for themselves what they
want to learn, why it is impor
tant and what directions their
learning can and should take
for the future, meaningful dis
cussion and effective advising
can occur," Rickert added.
"The. Personal Plan and Port¬

folio system does that by
prompting students to ask
questions of themselves and
keep a journal of their thoughts
and answers."
The aim of the project is
to create within Gettysburg's
College Navigation System
(CNAV) a variety of technol
ogy tools to help students
shape their education by mak
ing good choices from the ar
ray of academic programs, co
curncular programs and activi
ties available at the College.
CNAV is a highly sophisti
cated, interactive software pro
gram that matches an
individual's personal history
and interest profile with col
lege courses, visiting lectures,
exhibits, performances and
other activities.
The Personal Plan and

Portfolio system will draw on
the database, web page links
and extensive search capabili
ties of CNAV to allow students

to develop a personal "sylla
bus" that relates their goals and
objectives to their courses and
activities.
"Too many students take
the checklist approach and just
follow the academic program
the College suggests," Rickert
said. "They don't make

Former subway performer to ploy Junction

From staff reports
This Saturday, the Gettysburg
College Coffeehouse presents guitar
wizard and songwriting sensation Peter
Mulvey at 10 pm in the Junction. Ac
companying Mulvey on electric guitar
and e_]ectric mandolin will be David
"Goody" Goodrich, former member of
the band Groovasaurus. The duo will
present a mix of intelligent folk/rock
songs, but don't expect a quiet night in
the Junction from these two. Come out
and witness a groovefilled evening with
one of the top names on the acoustic
scene today. Free food and coffee will
be provided.
The Louisville Music News says,
"Mulvey's lyrics are intelligent, incisive,
and gently, brutally honest...His live
performances are an amazing tribute to
what one man can do with a guitar and
more than prove that Mulvey is a singer,/
songwriter in a league of his own."

Hailing from Milwaukee, Mulvey
honed his notorious performance skills
on the streets of Dublin and in the sub
ways of Boston. After playing a year of
exhausting 8-12 hour days for the mish¬

mash of people that passed him by,
Mulvey emerged from the subway and
stepped onto the stage of the Somerville
Theatre for the Boston Acoustic Under
ground competition where, in the
words of The Boston Herald's Dan
Gewertz, he "simply blew away the
competition...A year of subway perfor
mance [had] turned him into a magi
cian. In twelve minutes, he blended wit,
passion, a clear voice, and a sensational
guitar style that was both technically
complex and emotionally hot...Mulvey
was nearly incendiary, the clearest star
in- making." A record contract was
quick to follow and, in early 1996, he
recorded the brilliant, kinetic all-over
the-map album, Rapture.
As the record gained momentum
around the country, Mulvey left the
subway and hit the road. Word spread
very fast and, in no time, he began his
own, virtually non-stop, solo tour across
the US and Ireland, finding airplay on
some of the country's top college,
TripleA and modern rock stations.

These days, having recently re
turned from showcasing at the
Sundance Film Festival, Mulvey's

unique guitar style and tren
chant lyricism seem to be
gaining even more notice.
Mulvey's presence on the
Internet is fierce. His
website garners an average
of 1500 hits per week and,
following the recent theft of
his guitar, fans and peers
alike rushed to offer their
support and the site re
ceived over 10,000 hits in
two weeks.
There is no doubt
about it - Peter Mulvey is on
the brink of world-wide at
tention with a new, innova
tive style of acoustic music
that dares to push the enve
lope. Frequently bringing
multi-talented, multi
instrumentalist David
Goodrich along to accom
pany him, Mulvey contin
ues to captivate audiences

on this continent and
abroad. In the words on The Boston (as another ferocious acoustic-guitar
Phoenix: "To paraphrase Ani DiFranco, monster), * this ain't no namby-pamby
in whose orbit you might place Mulvey folk music.'"

Conference offers voice for all women

by Rachel Hanson
Staff Writer
Every woman should take charge
of her own life. It is her life and her
life alone - no one can live it for her.
One of the best ways a woman can take
control of her life is to get to know her
self and to become empowered as a
woman. The Women's Conference of
fers a great number of opportunities for
Gettysburg women to accomplish these
goals. This will be the eighth year that
Gettysburg College has held the
Women's Conference. The theme this
year is "The Millennium Woman: Cel
ebrating Her Devotions and Aspira
tions. "
The conference will be held in the
CUB on February 19 from 9:30 a.m. to
4 p.m.. The Women's Conference is an
excellent opportunity for women to
spend a day with fellow women students
as they partake in a number of differ
ent activities.

The day starts off with a forum
called "Finding Your Own Voice,"
where conference participants are given
a question to consider and form an
opinion on. Each question is then dis
cussed, and all women are given the
opportunity to voice and explain their
individual opinions.
This is followed by the first work
shop session. These workshops are dis
cussion-oriented and encourage the in
volvement and participation of all
women. This year there are seven dif
ferent workshops from which women
can choose: "Women in Solidarity" (a
discussion of how to break down barri
ers between women), "From Gettysburg
to the Real World: Making the Transi
tion" (recent graduates will share their
experiences during their first few years
in the workforce), "Show Me The
Money" (learn skills to ensure financial
success), "Once an Athlete, Always an
Athlete" (learn about sports related ca
reers for women), "Spirituality in Your
Everyday Life" (learn how to make your
life less stressful), "Breaking the Barri¬

ers: Women in Science and Technology"
(women in "nontraditional" fields share
their experiences), and "Voices of Ex
perience" (women students share their
experiences as a woman at Gettysburg).
Kate Michelman, President of the
National Abortion and Reproductive
Rights Action League (NARAL), will
then give a keynote address. Ms.
Michelman is a wonderful and dynamic
speaker who completely engages the
audience in her dialogue. No matter
where you stand in the abortion debate,
you are sure to be moved and inspired
by Ms. Michelman's story and stimu
lated by the issues she raises.
During lunch, Women of Distinc
tion awards will be given to women
from Gettysburg High School,
Gettysburg College, the Gettysburg
community, and an alumna of the Col
lege. Following lunch will be Experi
ential Education Workshops, where
women can learn about and practice
yoga, meditation, and self defense.

The day ends with a "Giveaway
Ceremony." This is a Native American
tradition where each woman shares the

significance of an object that she has
brought with her. Then each woman
rakes a sew item and thanks the origi
nal ow _^ ner for sharing her story. This is
an incredibly emotional experience that
is not lik\ly " to be be- forgotten.
The\Women's Conference is an
amazing experience for any woman.
There is such a great diversity in topics
discussed that every woman can find
something to enjoy. This is not a "femi
nist conference" orone developed with
a certain type of wom,an in mind.
All types of women - Greeks, ath
letes, liberals, conservatives, and femi
nists - can and will take something posi
tive from the conference. The more
diverse a group of women we have par
ticipate, the better the conference will
be. Come as a group or just bring your
self - but please be sure not to miss out
on this wonderful opportunity.

*Registration is Monday through
Friday, February 7 through the 15, from
11 a.m. to 1 p.m. in the CUB. Confer
ence cost is $6 or $3 with a meal card.

Students take to sewers
to save the Bay

by Jennie Marvelle
Vice President of GECO
Anyone who knows the
tri-state area well knows that
not only is the Chesapeake Bay
the main source of our drink
ing water, but also a beautiful
body of water that affords a
habitat and sustenance to many
forms of wildlife. Unfortu
nately, the natural resources
available from this once
abundant supplier have been so
exploited that the Chesapeake
Bay is in great danger.
This semester, one of the
main goals of GECO is to in
crease awareness about the pol
lution and exploitation of the
Chesapeake Bay by participat
ing in a program of storm drain
stenciling. GECO, and any
other interested participants,
will be attacking dumping sites,
specifically storm drains in the
Gettysburg area, armed with
spray paint and a stencil.

The purpose of this
project is to point out to would
be polluters that these storm
drains lead directly to the

Chesapeake Bay, most of the
time without running through
any sort of treatment plant.

has been
working d 1 1 i -
gently to
repair
the dam
a g e
done to

the bay since the development
of the surrounding lands. The
CBF is one of the most orga
nized and scientifically-sound
environmental organizations
in the United States.
In 1999, they published
"The State of the Bay," a de¬

tailed report which uses an in
dex to measure the health of the
bay today as compared to when
the land was first explored (and
thoroughly documented) by
Captain

John
Smith in
the early
1600s. Us
ing Cap
t a l n
Smith's
descrip
tions of
the un
spoiled
bay and
wetlands
as the
standard,
the bay
has been
ranked at
2 8 %
not, a 1%

health (believe it or
increase from 1998).
The long-term goal of the
CBF is to return the bay to 70%
health by the year 2050. In or
der to achieve this goal, they co
ordinate various projects with
volunteers.

Some of-these Volunteer
projects include planting trees,
creating habitats fo'r oysters,- re
storing wetlands, monitoring
fish spawning areas, speaking to
groups on. behalf of CBF, lob
bying, letterwnting campaigns,
and storm drain stenciling.
If you want to get in

website at
www.savethebay.cbf.org and
subscribe to their Chesapeake
Bay Action Network, which will
update you on what's going on
and what needs to be done.
If you're a resident of

Sundance Film Festival is all heart

by Jami Bernard
Knight-Ridder Tribune
Relationship movies are
setting hearts on fire at the
Sundance Film Festival, which
wraps this weekend.
Fine Line and Lions Gate
are said to be duking it out over
the crowdpleasing Love and
Sex. This semi-autobiographi
cal laugh-a-thon by Valerie
Breiman is based on her (now
defunct) relationship with film¬

maker Adam Rifkin.
"Welcome to my sex life"
is how Breiman ruefully intro
duced it.
Rifkin, still a buddy, later
took a bow for inspiring
Breiman's portrait of a woman
in search of a good relation
ship, starring Famke Janssen
and Jon Favreau. "I love doing
indie films," said the slightly
bulky Favreau after the pre
miere. "It's the only place
where I can get the girl."

Chuck and Buck, an
other relationship movie,
quickly was sold to Artisan for
$1.5 million as one of the first
buys of the fest. Mike White
wrote the screenplay and plays
Buck, an overgrown kid who
can't give up his crush on his
childhood friend. Director
Miguel Arteta (Star Maps)
took a picture of the audience
to show his parents "so they
can start taking this film
making thing a little more se
riously." The audience roared
— it was composed largely of
struggling filmmakers who
also have been told some
where along the line to get a
"real" job.
Among the other early
festival favorites on the verge
of getting picked up is You
Can Count on Me, a beauti
fully acted drama about es
tranged siblings who affect
each other like the tides, star
ring Laura Linney and Mark
Ruffalo, and yet another tal¬

ented Culkin child, Rory.
The documentary cat
egory has also proved particu
larly inspirational this year,
leaving audiences in tears. In
fact, you can't see Legacy with
out a full pack of Kleenex.
Filmmaker Tod S. Lend
ing followed one family around
the Chicago projects for five
years and documented their in
credible — and ultimately win
ning — struggle against pov
erty, drugs and the vicissitudes
of life. He began filming coin
cidentally on the day that one
of the family's most promising
children, 14-year-old Tyrrell,
was shot and killed by a class
mate on his way home from
school. Tyrrell's sister provides
the narration for the movie,
which is both heartbreaking and
immensely uplifting, and she
received standing ovations
wherever she went here.

The Sound and the Fury
is also about a family's emo
tional struggle — this time

over the hot-potato issue in the
deaf community of cochlear
implants for children, a way to
help them hear and develop
spoken language skills. A hear
ing mother and her adult deaf
son squared off on the issue, not
only in the movie but after
screenings here as well. It's an
important issue about a commu
nity that feels immensely threat
ened by encroaching technol
ogy. Also on the ka-ching
front: Fine Line bought Saving
Grace for a rumored $4 million,
with Blethyn starring as a
woman who grows pot to re
duce her debts, and Lions Gate
bought Two-Family House,
about an oppressive Staten Is
land household, starring the
delightfully plain-spoken

Humor, heartache bring Ashes to life

by Anne Schenck
Book Reviewer
With all of the hype over
the recent screen debut of Frank
McCourt_'s Pulitzer Prize win
ning memoir, "Angela's Ashes",
I couldn't resist checking it out
for myself. The story begins
with a pre-school aged Frankie,
his three younger brothers and
their Irish immigrant parents in
America and carries the reader
through the McCourt family's
troubles and subsequent return
to Ireland, and even harder
times in Ireland. The Irish
Catholic McCourts suffer one
hardship after another, from the
death of three children to the
unemployed father's weekly
routine of drinking away their
dole (welfare) money. Frank,
the oldest, is forced at times to
beg and steal to keep his
younger brothers warm and fed.

Although the story is at
times heartbreaking, the mis
fortunes of Mrs. McCourt and
her four surviving sons keep
them fiercely loyal to each
other, and the dream of some
day returning to America keeps
hope in the air. Frank does fi
nally return to America.
Through hard work and a little
dishonesty, he finally saves
enough to return to his birth
place before his twentieth
birthday. The story ends with
him standing on the deck of a
ship overlooking the lights of
America.
"Angela's Ashes", nar
rated by a young Frank
McCourt, is not just the sad
story of a destitute Irish fam
ily, but also a collection of the
humorous anecdotes and naive
misconceptions that only an
impoverished childhood in the
pious city of Limerick, Ireland,
could produce. McCourt has a

gift for working the poetry and
song of his life into the story
and decorates his autobiogra
phy with everything from
Shakespeare to the hymns of
Irish patriots.
McCourt tells of both the
good and the bad of his youth
openly and sincerely, from shar
ing breakfast with his father to
emptying his cousin's brimming
bedpan. With all that Frankie
and his family must endure, I
couldn't help but feel over
whelmingly grateful for Servo's
eggs to order, my closet of
clothing, and a legal ban on
corporal punishment in the
classroom. "Angela's Ashes" is
a must read for anyone who has
ever taken anything for
granted.
So how will the movie
fare? If it even comes close to
being as inspiring and touching
as the book, it'll be worth see
ing.

last semester failed. It appears
that the newly purchased pen
cil sharpener is a low per
former.
Libby tested it herself
and, lo and behold, it is per
haps, even worse than the
model it replaced. That one,
you may recall, ground pen
cils to sawdust, threatened the
fingers, produced grey smoke
on occasion and, on top of
that, made an awful racket.
But here's the problem,
battery operated pencil sharp
eners are cheesy. No question
about it. They just don't work.
But we are out of electrical
options at the front desk. We
can't plug in one more thing.
So the industrial strength elec¬

tric model that you pine for is
not a possibility. There are three
excellent, electric pencil sharp
eners within a short walk of the
front desk. Check out the one
in front of the printer and the
two in reference.
Dear Libby,
Please give us a place to
smoke in the library. It is way
too cold to smoke outside. -
Freezing Dear Freeze,
Not a chance! If you want
to ruin your lungs, get lines all
over your face, cough uncon
trollably, and walk around with
your hair and clothes stinking
like yesterday's trash that's your
business, but while you're in the
act of making yourself termi¬

nally ill, you can do it outside.
Tough luck.
Dear Libby,
Put heat in the window
rooms of the library. (No sig
nature)
Dear Chilly,
I hear you. Libby just
took a walk around and you're
not kidding. It is chilly in those
window rooms.
Libby did some checking
and wait until you hear this.
Heat in the window bays
comes through the floor—
some kind of radiant heat
popular in the 1970s. But
since the glass isn't insulated
all the heat goes right out the
window, so to speak. Now is
this a design flaw or what?
Musselman Library was
built back when oil cost thirty
cents a gallon or something
and the designers and builders
didn't think about the fact that
someday we'd be paying to
heat the great outdoors.

Libby will tell you an
other secret. That glass in
those study bays isn't the stur
diest either, so don't go around
roughhousing in those cubicles
or you might just shatter the
glass, or fall out the window if
you're really getting frisky.
Libby talked to Dave
Swisher in Maintenance who
showed her a plan to begin re
placing the existing glass with
glass that is stronger and insu
lated. The heating system in
Musselman Library is also on
the drawing board for some
major upgrades. A lot of the
thermostats in the library
aren't working because the
wiring embedded in the brick
pillars is rotted out. I know
that doesn't help the cold situ
ation for you.

Sometimes Libby would
like to get her hands around
the throat of the architect of
Musselman Library who cre
ated some lovely looking
spaces that are practically non
functional because of the heat
or cold. For the time being you
may want to bring a blanket,
wear your insulated under
wear, or move out into the cen¬

ter part of the library where it*
is warmer. You're right, and*

Napster shutdown will
increase efficiency of
library operations
I want to express my appreciation to
the staff of IR for taking an unpopu
lar but important step when they
shut down Napster this week. I'd like
to let the students who are most un
happy about this decision know how the
use of the network for non-academic
purposes was affecting the academic en
terprise of your fellow students.
Napster was playing a major role
in the degradation of library services.
It was taking up to five minutes for us
to send one interlibrary loan request on
the network. It took even longer to
print status reports on the periodicals
and books that students ordered.
As we get into the semester the
library staff processes hundreds of in
terlibrary loan requests a week. If we

Bismarkian ethos
crushes idealism
I have always been an idealistic per
son. Unfortunately we live in a so
ciety that rewards idealism with
only scorn and disdain. Those in our
society who show any signs of idealism
are ridiculed and berated until they have
become just as cynical as the unwashed
masses.
This is our society as a whole, but
I always believed that there was still one
forum in our society where idealism was
rewarded. A place were the free ex
change of ideas and a willingness to try
and make the world we live in a better
place still remained the guiding beacon
by which people lived.

A message from

President Haaland
I' m sure that by now you have all
heard the tragic news from Seton
Hall University in New Jersey,
where three students died and 54 oth
ers were injured in a fire that swept
through a residence hall two weeks ago.
While the cause of the fire has not yet
been determined, one thing is clear -
many students ignored the fire alarm.
Let us all take this as a reminder
that we must respond to any and all fire
related incidents and alarms with ut
most urgency. No alarm should be con
sidered "false" until your residence hall
is emptied and Safety/Security officers
have indicated that it is safe to re-enter
the building.
Remember that pulling a fire
alarm is not a "joke." Ignoring one can
be deadly. Do your part to help us all to
live more safely at Gettysburg!
Sincerely,
Gordnn A. Haaland

Consider This

Recently, questions have arisen regarding students purchasing
textbooks from online vendors and therefore bypassing the traditional
college bookstore outlet. There is some evidence that the administra
tion is concerned about this, and is taking steps to intervene. Obvi
ously, the College is nervous about losing a significant source of in
come for the institution as well as increasing mail room volume due to
incoming packages.
It is crucial to remember that competition in the business world is
based on offering the best product at the low¬

est price to consumers. If the College was re
ally concerned about losing student business,
they would simply have to make their product
more convenient for the consumer (students).
The pre-order program with a 10% dis
count was a great idea, but it might not have
been enough. Evolution of social practices
occurs in trends and patterns; if students re
ally feel that the bookstore offers them less
savings than they can get elsewhere, then pa
tronage at the bookstore will cease to exist.
The College must decide if maintaining a
profitable bookstore is an important and viable
goal, and then must take steps to meet that
goal. Trying to curb online book purchases (or
even Internet access to certain sites) are not
acceptable means to meet that end.
From the student perspective, textbooks
are highly overpriced for the value they offer.
Most textbooks are bought back at miniscule
fractions of their original price.

The College could potentially try to recycle
more textbooks, or encourage faculty to send
in their lists of textbooks for the following se
mester earlier, bringing buy-back prices up to
at least the 50% level. Each student spends
hundreds of dollars each semester on books,
and the College is unreasonable to expect stu
dents not to seek even a small amount of sav
ings per term.

Finally, as trite as complaints about our $30,000 sound, the ad
ministration must realize that students expect accountability for the
sacks of money we hand over. This is not a research institution: most
teachers and students agree that students come first here.
If the College wants to increase bookstore purchases, they will
have to fiqure something out: it's their problem, not ours.

New Hampshire aside, Bush is still best

by John Dunlap
Political Columnist
The presidential nomi
nation season is underway and
the surprises have already be
gun. Senator John McCain of
Arizona's big win over Texas
Governor George W. Bush has
damaged Bush and put his
seemingly inevitable candidacy
at risk. While Bush's defeat in
New Hampshire may not be
good, there is a glimmer of
hope for the Governor: in re
cent history every Republican
frontrunner has stumbled early,
but all have made it to the

.
In 1980, Ronald Reagan's
nomination was in doubt
when George W. Bush's
father, George Bush, de- A
feated Reagan in the k
Iowa Caucus. In New
Hampshire, Reagan H
came back to crush Bush H
and eventually win the H
nomination. H
Eight years later
the frontrunner, then
Vice President George Bush fin
ished third in Iowa, behind
Senate Republican Leader Bob
Dole and evangelist Pat
Robertson. Bush went on the
attack, and with his no new
taxes pledge, both won in New
Hampshire and consolidated
his frontrunner status in South
Carolina.

The frontrunner's di
lemma arose again in 1996
when Bob Dole barely made it
out of Iowa with a victory be
fore falling behind Pat
Buchanan in New Hampshire.
After stumbles in Delaware
and Arizona, where he lost to
Steve Forbes, Dole made a dra
matic comeback in South Caro
lina and proceeded to sweep
the national primaries in
March.
After winning in Iowa
and being crushed in New
Hampshire, Governor Bush
must now rally Republicans
around him in South Carolina
and then sweep the national
primaries. South Carolina will
not be an easy fight for the

Governor. While he has the
support of most of the Repub
lican establishment in the state,
Senator McCain is backed by
two very popular South Caro
lina Congressman, Lindsay
Graham and Mark Sanford.
The state also has the
highest percentage of veterans
in the nation, which should
boost Vietnam veteran, John
McCain's cause. South Caro
lina has an open primary where
independents and Democrats
can vote in the GOP primary
and they, not Republicans, are
McCain's primary supporters.
A loss in South Carolina
will not finish Bush.

_^_h in
_B|^| Delaware
next week
where Steve Forbes will try to
save his campaign, and he will
have the strong support of
Michigan Governor John
Engler in the vote right after
South Carolina.
Arizona votes on this
same day, and the fact that it is
McCain's home state does not
mean the Senator is safe. Ari
zona Governor Janet Hull has
endorsed Bush, and polls show
the race is close (which says
something about John
McCain). From there we go
into national primaries, where
Bush's endorsements come into
play - along with his campaign
war chest.

While the Republican
race has bee pleasantly civil in
comparison to the Democrats'
bickering, Bush must lay out
the stark differences between
himself and John McCain in
South Carolina. McCain calls
his tax cut conservative; it is
about the size of Bill Clinton's
and does not foster long-term
economic growth. Mr. "Pre
tend . tp , be . _ap Outsider"

McCain puts too much faith in
Washington, which is not sur
prising since he has served in
Congress for nearly eighteen
years and is Chairman of the
Senate Commerce Committee.
George W. Bush is follow
ing Ronald Reagan's formula
for tax cutting: cut taxes across
the board, allowing revenues to
grow. If the Democrats in Con
gress would have allowed Presi
dent Reagan to fully implement
his program, the budget could
have been balanced a decade
earlier.
Allowing the economy to
grow with tax reductions will
cause revenues to increase.
That is how we will save so
^ cia l security and Medicare.
W The Bush plan also uses the

econo
estimates, establishing a safety
net for debt reduction.
John McCain claims to be
acting in the image of Ronald
Reagan, but he looks to be
emulating Bill Clinton.
McCain loves Washington con
trol; he voted with the liberal
members of the Senate for the
tobacco bill which raised taxes
and sent power to Washington.
The Senator also favors a cam
paign reform plan that would
give us public financing of cam
paigns and take away the rights
of ordinary citizens to contrib
ute to political parties and or
ganizations. His plan allows
the labor unions to continue
their onslaught on the Repub
lican Party.

Look at the people who

The continued fight over
Elian Gonzalez continues to
put the American dream to
shame.
Those who support the
detainment of Gonzalez in
America are under the illusion
that the American dream is
more important than patrio
tism, family, and human dig
nity. The case of Gonzalez il¬

lustrates America's ignorance
regarding Cuba and itself. In
his January 27, column, "Jus
tice of Tyranny? The Case of
Elian Gonzalez," Dan
Ballentyne writes that Gonzalez
should be detained in United
States for reasons of "justice
and human decency."
Ballentyne likens Castro to the
greatest criminals of the 20th
century. He says, "We
wouldn't send a boy back to
Hitler or Stalin, so we should
not send one Castro."

Clearly, Cuba is not an
ideal nation. Fidel Castro, who
assumed power in 1959, has
run the country ruthlessly. The
people of Cuba, described by
some as the friendliest in the
world, have been subjected to
murder, oppression, and deceit
by the government.
Nonetheless, Fidel
Castro's policies have ensured
that Cuba has the lowest illit
eracy rate in the world as well
as a world-renowned health
care system. In addition,
though Castro has committed
atrocities, he has never sub
jected hundreds of thousands
of people to death as did Hitler
and Stalin.
Two issues override the
United States' power to retain
Elian. First, Gonzalez was born
and raised in Cuba. He is a
Cuban citizen and no doubt
treasures his homeland-a pow
erful force. Studies have shown

that immigration is traumatiz
ing - depression and intense
homesickness are common
symptoms. Immigrants often

regret their decision to relocate
when they find an America less
promising than they had
hoped.
Cuba is undoubtedly on
the verge of change. Castro has
held power for 40 years and he
is growing old. If history is any
indicator, communism in Cuba
will fold. It is wrong for the
United States to deny Elian the
possibility of participating in
Cuba's future.
Furthermore, it is igno
rant to assume that Elian's life
will be more fulfilling in the
United States. Patriotism aside,
Elian must be returned on the
grounds of human rights. Elian
has a loving, providing father
in Cuba. This fact overrides
any political or social issue. It's
simple. Parents retain the right
to raise their children.

Attorney General Janet
Reno correctly ordered the
quick return of the boy. Be
cause of deep anti-Castro sen
timent in South Florida, how
ever, a Miami judge has post
poned the order. This action
has only succeeded in making
worse an already traumatic ex
perience.
Ballentyne writes: "I am
very much a pro-family conser
vative. I am also a devout anti
Commumst." Ballentyne has a
problem; in this case he can't

be both. Much like many citi
zens of South Florida,
Ballentyne has allowed his po
litical stance to interfere with
Elian's welfare.
The Gonzalez case is not
about Communism. Nor does
it involve Fidel Castro. It is a
question of Elian's quality of
life in Cuba. All available evi
dence suggests that Elian was
happy, healthy and received
good parental care in Cuba.
No evidence exists to override
his father's rights.

Elian Gonzalez, political
prisoner, has been held captive
by those whose hatred of
Castro has led them to disre
gard love and patriotism. Too
bad Elian did not land in Jack
sonville, Galveston, Charles
ton, or New Orleans. If so, he
would have been reunited with
his family long agoj -

What Bill Clinton left out of the
State of the Union

Last Thursday, Bill

thankfully, be his last State of

lasted nearly an hour and a half
and sounded like Bill Clinton

good that happened in the last
eight years, then saying that Al
Gore came up with half the
policies that were imple
mented.
Needless to say, as al
ways, Bill Clinton did not tell
the truth. Not only are things
not as good as Clinton said, but
neither Clinton or Gore is
responsible for the things
that are good: former _^^_B
President Ronald _^^H
Reagan and the _^^^
Republican _^^H
Congress are. _^ _^-_^^H

Clinton, he had ^^^^^B
nothing to do with
the current economy, except to
slow up the current boom with
what Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan (D-NY) has called
the "largest tax increase in the
history of the world."

It is this tax increase that
raised taxes so much that it
now takes two paychecks to do
what one did 25 years ago. It
was this tax increase, among
the other debacles of the early
Clinton Administration, which
directly led to his party's los
ing control of Congress for the
first time since 1954.
Bill Clinton also took
credit for the balanced budget.
Let us look back at what actu
ally happened. For two years,
Bill Clinton had a Democratic
Congress to work with, and he
made no effort to* balance the

budget. Instead, he raised taxes,
did nothing to curb spending,
and tried to have the govern
ment take over one-seventh of
the US economy.
When the Republicans
won the Congress, he fought
tooth and nail against the first
Republican balanced budget
proposal. The arguments made
were lies. Clinton accused Re

cans of
I want
ing

been cut back to such an ex
tent that almost, if not all, of
our active duty divisions our
under strength, we have ships
at sea one thousand men short,
we are constantly cannibalizing
equipment for spare parts. We
nearly ran out cruise missiles
during the Kosovo War. It was
Bill Clinton who cut defense to

this point, and is now trying to
say he wants more, and pro
poses token increases. Our
country is weaker now than it
was in 1993.
Morality has been
dragged through the mud un
der Clinton. Abortions con
tinue, and this administration
continues to defend the
murder of the most inno
^- cent of innocents, the

unborn, as a right.
Drug use is up
nearly 200 per
cent. In addition,
we send bad mes
1 sages through the
I courts with soft
I sentences.
L Bill
Clinton has
had the oppor
B tunity to use
M the "bully
W pulpit" of the
White House

children out on the streets and
the elderly to eat dog food.
Gore said Republicans
wanted to kill people. These
statements are obviously false
to any thinking person, but this
is what they used to kill the
balanced budget. Clinton, not
the Congress, then shut down
the government to try to break
the Congress. To reach the bal
anced budget agreement that
finally emerged, Clinton had to
be dragged kicking and scream
ing to the negotiating table. Yet,
he says he is responsible for the
balanced budget.
Despite the economic
prosperity we now enjoy, which
is thanks to Ronald Reagan not
Bill Clinton, things are not go
ing so well outside the eco
nomic sphere. Our military has

to condemn the entertainment
industry for its lack of moral
character but has never made
more than a small statement
here or there to look good. The
family continues to weaken.
The social fabric is weakened
because of Bill Clinton.
This is just a small sample
of how the country has been
worse off under Clinton. More
could be said on many issues.
Government corruption could
have an article, actually a book,
all its own.
The Clinton administra
tion has seriously hurt the
union and can be said to be the
worst administration in the his
tory of the republic. This is
how I believe history will
record the Clinton Administra
tion.

The saga of Elian

by Christina Dickert
Political Columnist
Elian, Elian, Elian. What
are we going to do with you '
We know that you don't really
know what's going on here, but
it seems like everyone else does.
You were one of three
survivors of the terrible trag
edies that took place in the Car
ibbean this November. Your
mother and her boyfriend died,
leaving you stranded in Florida
with no immedi- ate

family. But V
wait! Your fa- \
ther has an / M
uncle in Little / _^_flfl
Havana. I'm _^_Q
sure there *
would be no prob
lem with you staying
with him for a little

while, until you can re
turn home.

I m sure you miss _^F
home, your dad, your grand
mothers, and your friends. No,
don't worry, little one, your
uncle and cousins will try to
make up for it by bring you to
Disney World and buying you
the puppy you have always
wanted.
I know it's hard, having
to go to a new school and make
new friends while everyone
knows you as the Cuban boy
whose face is plastered on the
cover of every newspaper and
on the evening news every
night. I'm sure it's exciting,

being the center of attention
and getting all these gifts. But
what's going to happen when
all the excitement dies down
and you're just plain old Elian?
That's going to be tough.
Auntie Janet Reno is trying to
get you home to see your dad.
She ruled that it was in your
best interest to send you back
to Cuba, but your Miami rela
tives have gone to court to keep
you in the U.S. I know it's hard
because your dad refuses to
come to the United States to
pick you up, but I'm sure you
can understand why.
No, Uncle Fidel isn't,bet i

ing the big bad meanie that the
Republicans are making him
out to be. Your dad shouldn't
have to come pick you up. You
should have been returned to
Cuba before Christmas, where
you could have gone to Christ
mas mass with your dad and
abuelas. (Just in case you were
too young to remember, Elian,
Uncle Fidel does let you choose
your own religion now, and
you can even practice it pub
licly.) But Uncle Jesse Helms
has an even better Christmas
present for you! He wants to

make you an American citizen
so you can stay in the United
States for
(_SV_^_l Yippee!
B_^^B_^^^^H\ The only
IIIH_^_V \ con dition
^^^^_HK \ is that
¥1 \you'll
M \ have to
_^0 forget
about your
old life in Cuba (yes, that
means your family too) and be
come an American. Isn't that
what you always wanted? Oh,
that's right. No one bothered

to ask you that.
I guess Uncle Jesse is too
busy making sure that the Cu
ban Americans are happy so
they will vote Republican in
November. Did you know that
they are the only Latino group
who votes Republican consis
tently? I guess that's why we
sent those other boat people
back to Haiti in the early 90's,
and why we have to beef up
border patrol to send those ter
rible Mexicans back across the
border. They'll understand.

I'm going to tell you a
story now Elian. It's going to
require a lot of imagination,
but I think you can do it. A
child escaped Florida and was
trying to sail across the Carib
bean to Cuba with his mother
and her boyfriend. They died
en route, just like your mom
and her boyfriend.

Social Commentator
I think one of the most
beneficial activities for one's
personal development is a con
tinual re-examination of the
self. As 1 look at myself, I find
that some of the greatest influ
ences in my life have come
from stories relayed by my vari
ous elderly family members.
Often when I hear their
stories I am amazed by their
hard work and the drive and
personal and physical courage
they exhibited in their lives. I
admire these ever-so-distant
figures, but at times I find my
self ashamed by my lack of such

timely fashion, there is little
chance of getting the book or
article you need before your
paper is due.
Speaking of articles, we
subscribe to over 500 periodi
cals online. We have dozens of
online indexes, all of which we
pay top dollar for, so that you
can have instant access to mil
lions of citations in journals,
books, newspapers and govern
ment documents. Often these
citations come with the full text
of the articles.
Imagine sitting at a work
station in the library or in your
room and waiting several min
utes for a response every time
you enter a search statement.
Everyone can tolerate a little
slowness once in awhile, but
the problem was more than
occasional sluggishness.

Our instruction librarians
couldn't show an online data
base to a class because the net
work was stalled. Picture a
class of thirty students wasting
their time, sitting there in mind
numbing silence watching the
librarian trying to connect.
It was getting to the point
that the online indexes and
journals weren't accessible be
cause the network was so slow.
Do you want to go back to

motivation and drive. I hope
to share with you this anxiety
and my own personal angst at
being a product of a very dif
ferent and distant culture com
pared to theirs.
My paternal great-grand
parents came across the ocean
at the turn of the century to
find opportunity and hopefully
a new life in a country they
knew little about. My great
grandfather left Wales because
of the hazardous conditions
and low wages in the English
owned mines. He came across
the ocean alone, and his first
purchase in what he thought
would be a rich and successful
life, was a silver watch dated
1893, the year he set sail on his

in Reader's Guide to Periodical
Literature? I don't think so. To
have a vital, modern, electronic
library we need a vital network.
From a practical stand
point, at certain times of the
day the library's infrastructure
ground to a halt. We couldn't
send out book orders to our
suppliers. We could not import
catalog records. We could not
send electronic payments for
materials. We couldn't receive
online data in any form. It was
beginning to look like the best
time for the staff to work was
between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m.
Unfortunately, our vendors are
at home and asleep when our
network is at its speediest.

I ask those of you who
have been the most critical
since Napster was shut down
to consider what we're here for.
The academics should be front
and center for all of us. The
people hired by this institution
to bring you a top flight elec
tronic library and instant access
to online resources are commit
ted to doing so. They need
your support to do their jobs,
and to make your job as a stu

adventure.
Instead of stumbling
upon the grand life he ex
pected, he went to Pittsburgh
and worked in the mines out
side the great steel city well into
his sixties, never learning to
read nor write a word of En
glish. When he died in his nine
ties, he was a weathered and
battered man who had never
complained a bit about his life,
not even of the years of low
wages and hardship.
My family takes pride in
the work ethic and strength of
character exemplified by an
other great-grandfather. He

came over from Europe around
the turn of the century, moved
to Pittsburgh, and worked
through his seventies in the
steel mills of McKees Rocks.
When he died at 103 years of
age, I was a baby of two sitting
on his lap in the nursing home.
My father chose my
middle name after this stalwart
individual named Andrew. Just
like my other great-grandfa
ther, Andrew could neither
read nor write any English, but
could _fluently speak five lan
guages and was known for his
pride in the fact that he had
lived what he thought to be the

American dream.
As I reminisce about these
tales I have to examine what
are my own faults and weak
nesses. It is understandable
that our families, all immi
grants, have similar stories and
that the sufferings and trials
they went through were just a
product of the times. How
ever, there are certain univer
sal truths evident regardless of

times, and I cannot help but
feel so very privileged and
lucky in comparison.
Or am I really? I am
lucky to be here, and to have
all of the advantages they
worked for and often did not
attain. Of course I am lucky,
from a material and medical
standpoint. I am also very
lucky to have nice clothes on
my back and not to have to
worry where the next meal will
come from.
However, in comparison,
I often feel so apathetic when I

look at my own work ethic and
that of those around me. The
times were not simpler then,
they were much more complex
and perhaps my apathy is a
product of all these luxuries.
When we look at the ethi
cal standards of our own gen
eration, as well as the work
ethic and basic lack of some
sort of universal morality in so
ciety, I feel as though, possibly
as a product of this generation,
I am corrupted. Not by soci
ety in general, but by my own
lack of drive or focus.

I hope that someday I,
and we, can do all the hardship
of our ancestors some sort of
justice. We have had so many
luxuries and so many gifts that
it would be a terrible shame to
waste them all in a country of
so much opportunity. I guess
my message simply is that
maybe we all could do better
in our personal and profes
sional lives. Every empire must
fall someday, and a nation
founded by such hard work
should not be corrupted by its
own apathy and luxuries.

For me, this place was the
American higher education sys
tem. Unfortunately for me,
these illusions were quickly
shattered. And then, to add
insult to my injury, our young
"Columnist" has once again
graced us with his perplexing
tripe. Last week's installment of
the young cynic's chronicles
once again graces the lowly
reader with the infinite and
profound wisdom of the ages,
as interpreted by our guide, the
"Columnist". Our guide ex
plains to us how, through the
education of our children, the
world can become a more
open-minded place for all.

Our "Columnist" how
ever does not seem to be of the
most open-minded sort. I am
sorry Herr Columnist; I do not
think I would ever seek advice
from you on ways to make so
ciety more open-minded.
The Bismarkian system of
order that I am afraid our "Col
umnist" would expound seems
more fitting in an Orwelhan
novel than our society. I, for
one, refuse to bow down to the
Prussian sensibilities that have
twice within the last hundred
years thrown the world into
global conflict.
I must give our "Colum
nist" credit; he is quite good at

creating impossible solutions
for real problems. The idea of
turning the freshman class into
a society of hunter-gatherers is
amusing. I think we all realize
that this is not a viable solution
for overcrowding problems in
the dining hall.
I am forced to wonder
how many problems, both lo
cal and global, could be solved
if we all spent more time think
ing of viable solutions rather
than supercilious quips made at
the expense of an entire group
of people. I ask you all, do not
let the cynics of the world win;
do not let idealism die.

Uncle Fidel and his "ty
rannical" regime tried to keep
him in Cuba, claiming that the
Marxist communist system
would be better for the little
boy. He wouldn't die of star
vation or be mistreated. He'd
live like any other Cuban has
lived for the past 50 years.
Well, Uncle Jesse Helms
and his friends, the Republicans

decided that was wrong, so
they concluded chat this was an
international kidnapping. The
United States declared that this
child was a hostage, and imme
diately -began to take action
against Cuba. What kind of
action? Don't worry about that
now, Elian. I don't want you
to have any nightmares. I hope
this one will end soon.

America's one true choice: John

iiY Brini LaRosa
CoNIKIHUUNC_" , WruFK

Who needs to be the dar
ling of the media when you
have a campaign war chest the
size of a state lottery jackpot?
Is it fair that the candidate who
has raised the most money is
automatically assumed to be
the fioutrunner? I can tell you
why George W Bush is not the
darling of the media: he is too
scared to go in front of report
ers out of fear that one of them
might figure out that his shitty
politics, his fuzzy stands on is
sues and his half-baked ideas -
like his upper-class, crony-tot
mg, trickle-down tax plan - are
really undefendable political

positions in a booming
economy with so many con
tented voters.
Pundits will try to con
vince you that a broad based
tax cut is the solution to any of
your problems. I ask you, what
economic hardship is the top
tier of our tax system faced
with to justify the Bush tax cut?
Ultra-conservatives will
also try to convince you that
moderates are only a minority
in our Grand Old Party. Well,
I am here to tell you that, con
trary to popular belief, being
moderate is not asm. And it is
the moderate candidate that

can garner cross-party support
and sway independent voters in
the general election. In 1996,
the Republicans supported a

rathei consci v_.nive candidate
that wilted when many of our
great party defected to vote foi
Bill Clinton.
Do not misinterpiet my
leasonmg here, we fought the
good fight for Bob Dole in
1996, and now in 2000, the
good fight falls into the lap of
a Republican who can win na
tionally, |ohn McCain. Sena
tor McCain is trying to salvage
some vestige of normality _and
moderation from a party that
is increasingly controlled by a
ultra-conservative minority.
With a tax cut tor middle and
lower income Americans, cam
paign finance reform, a pledge
to strengthen the military, a
pro-life record, and a commit
ment to returning education to
the states, McCain embodies
the true principles of "compas
sionate conservatism."
This principle of "com¬

passionate conservatism is one
that Bush claims to support, but
his politics look more like those
of the most conservative - and
scariest - candidates in the field,
Alan Keyes and Pat Buchanan.
Frankly, I do not see the com
passion in Mr. Bush. However,
in a nation believing more and
more in the almighty dollar,
John McCain's modest fund
raising all but renders his can
didacy void if he fails to win in
the next stages of the primaries.
The good people of New
Hampshire gave Senator
McCain a nice send off for his
months of campaigning in their

state in the form of a \9 per
cent victory over Bush, deliv
ered by Republicans and Inde
pendents alike. However, the
biggest tests still he ahead for
McCain, and facing a campaign
with cash flow issues, it may be
a very bumpy road ahead.
Most Americans still believe,
despite McCain's overwhelm
ing win on Tuesday, that the
race will boil down to Bush and
Vice-President Al Gore.
In that case, many hard
working true Republicans will
have to go to the voting booth
in November holding their
noses and pulling the lever for
a candidate they know does not
represent their interests just so
we do not have four years of
Democrats staining the White
House.

In the meantime, the
good fight can still be won!
America no longer needs to be
disgusted with major party can
didates; we now have John
McCain.
Finally, the only reason
Bush opposes Senator
McCain's campaign finance
reform is because it means that
Bush will not be able to pull off
the astronomical amount of
fund-raising he did in this cam
paign the next time he takes his
"youthful indiscretion," issue
evading image on the road.
The scariest part of Mr. Bush
is not that he thinks he is a
moderate, it is that he has ac
tually convinced most of
America that he really is one.

Inadequately

I am writing regarding the
poor way the College
handled this week's snow
storm. First of all, I am ex
hausted because I was awak
ened at 2 a.m. last night by the
snowplows in front of my
dorm. In addition to the noise,
the headlights from the plows
were streaming into my room
and it was nearly impossible to
sleep. I do not understand why
they waited so long to plow
when the snow stopped falling
hours before.
Second of all, my a** is
sore from how poorly the side
walks were shoveled. I do not

know how many times in the
past week I had to walk on
complete ice because the side
walk was not clear. I know I am
not the only one who has
fallen. I have seen numerous
people slip and fall on the ice.
You would think that the
College would want the stu
dents, faculty, and staff to be
safe while walking across cam
pus, but I guess that it not the
case, judging by how ineffec
tively the campus was plowed.
Unless this school wants to be
sned for a lot of money by a
student who has injured them
selves by falling on the ice, I
strongly urge the College to
take more precautions the next
time snow is forecasted. 1

Bullets wrestle to 4-4 season

From Staff Reports
Since being back in ses
sion, Gettysburg's wrestling
team has recorded a 4-4
record. The following is a
summary of this semester's
matches.
On Tuesday January 2,
the Bullets fell to Shippensburg
32-9 in non-conference action.
Tim Scarpato won by decision
at 157 to give Gettysburg its
only earned points. After
watching Gettysburg drop four
straight bouts, Scarpato
jumped out to a 7-0 first-pe
riod lead over Red Raider Ja
son Moyer.
Over the remaining two
periods, Moyer gained back
the seven points, but Scarpato
earned another six points with
two near-falls and a riding time
point to maintain the win.
Morgan Douglas (184) also
collected six forfeit points for
the Bullets.

Four days later, the Bul
lets hosted a quad match with
Johns Hopkins, Muhlenberg,
and Swarrhmore. Chris Beck

(174) won all three of his bouts
by fall to lead Gettysburg to
victory. The Bullets beat Johns
Hopkins 27-16, Muhlenberg
30-18 and Swarthmore 54-6.
Gettysburg opened up
the day against Johns Hopkins,
and opened up the match with
two pin wins by 149-pounder
Andrew Buck and Scarpato.
Buck pinned Tim Laddbush at
4:29 and Scarpato pinned
Kartikya Ahuja at 6:30 to push
the Gettysburg lead to 12-0.
The Bullets collected a decision
by Brandon Smith (184) and a

forfeit win by Shawne Green
(285) to clinch the victory.
Buck dropped a decision
in his match-opening bout ver
sus Muhlenberg, but Scarpato
collected a decision at 157 and
167-pounder Matt Helwig
earned Gettysburg another
three decision points versus
Dan Ochoa to give the Bullets
a 6-3 lead going into Beck's
second bout of the day.
Beck collected his second
pin in the bout and put Gettys
burg ahead 12-3. The Mules
forfeited 18 points through the
remaining matches and eventu¬

ally fell 18-30 to the Bullets.
Swarthmore opened their
match against Gettysburg with
three forfeits before Beck col
lected his third pin of the day.
Smith followed Beck's perfor
mance by pinning Les Fox in
the very next bout to put the
score at 30-0.
Following the quad
match victory, Gettysburg trav
eled to Lancaster to square off
against Franklin &c Marshall,
looking to extend their winning
streak to four. The streak was
halted, however, as the Bullets
fell to the Diplomats 31-16.
Brandon Smith posted the only
Gettysburg non-forfeit win.
Smith earned a major decision
over Diplomat freshman Scott
Zimmerman, posting a 15-7

score. The Bullets then traveled
to Messiah College for another
quad match. Smith garnered
two pins and a major decision
as Gettysburg downed
Albright, and lost to Messiah
and York in non-conference
action. With the win and two
losses, the Bullets overall
record stands at 7-14-1.

Smith opened up his day
by winning a major decision
over York grappler Hayden
Myers to give the Bullets their
first points of the match.
Heavy weight Shawne Green
followed Smith with a decision
win and 141-pounder Vincent
Carbonaro won his bout before
Chris Beck finished the Bullet
scoring, with a pin in the final
bout of the match.
Smith again earned Get
tysburg's first points, pinning
his Albright opponent. Dou
glas followed Smith with a

technical fall win while Gettys
burg saw wins by decision from
157-pounder Tim Scarpato and
Beck. Smith's third win of the
day came when he pinned
York's Tanner Kolb while Steve
Kareha earned the Bullets only
other points of the match when
he pinned Chris Fields at 133.
Gettysburg's returns to
action on Saturday when they
travel to Annville for the Leba
non Valley College for a quad
match with the hosts, Delaware
Valley, and Ursinus.

Last Second Heroics Charge
Men's Basketball over Dickinson

by Erik Bullwinkel
Staff Writer
Every player dreams of
hitting the game winning shot
as time expires. The dream
came true not once, but twice
for the Bullets last Wednesday.
First, Curtis McNeil pushed the
Bullets into overtime with a last
second three pointer. Maybe
that was enough for one night.
But Jim Natale came up
big in overtime. His three
pointer with four seconds left
gave the Bullets their first lead
of the game and a victory over
conference rival Dickinson.
The shot gave Natale his
first career ten point game and
the first game-winning shot of
his college career.
"This was an important
win," said Natale, "now with
the division wide open. It
helped our confidence a lot.

We really needed the win."
The moments leading up
to McNeilPs heroics were nail
biting. Trailing 65-58 with
2:31 left, the Bullets began to
foul the Red Devils on each of
their possessions. The Red
Devils held a 76-70 lead with
14 seconds remaining.
Junior Greg Schreiber
banked in a deep three with 7
seconds left, to bring the Bul
lets within one basket of put
ting the game into overtime.
Demetri Tyler of
Dickinson then missed two free
throws to set up McNeil's he
roics. Sophomore Terrence
Callahan dished off to McNeil
who made a falling away 25
footer just before the buzzer.
McNeil and Natale's ef
forts were made possible in part
by a strong performance by Bill
Davidson. The senior forward
chipped in a game-high 30
points, 26 of which came in the

second half.
In addition to Davidson
and Natale, Schreiber reached
double figures, scoring 12.
Rolling on the steam of
the big victory against
Dickinson, the Bullets visited
Swarthmore College and re
turned home with a convincing
72-52 victory. The Bullets shot
62% from the field.
After trailing 4-0 in the
early moments of the game,
Gettysburg went on an 8-0 run
and never looked back.
The Bullets were again
led by Davidson, with 20 points
on a sizzling nine of ten shoot
ing. Davidson was rewarded
for his efforts by being named
to the Centennial Conference
Weekly Honor Roll. Schreiber
also reached double figures
with 15.
As a team, the Bullets re
corded a season high nine
blocks, three of which came

from senior
forward Rich
Pfiel. McNeil
had a team
leading and ca
reer high seven
rebounds.
The Bul
lets have won
seven of their
last nine games
and are in a
three-way tie
for second
place in the
conference,
with Johns
Hopkins and
Dickinson.

cited a number of individuals
for coming through with strong
showings. "Overall, it was a
very solid team performance,
especially given the number of
new people. I believe that both
teams will be among the most
competitive since I have been
here." Therit echoed Coach
Condon's sentiments: "This is
the best I think we have ever
looked in my experiences at
Gettysburg," she said. "The
upcoming season is certainly
bright and we have many ex
pectations."
The meet can be per
ceived as a starting block for
the rest of the season, and the
captains feel eager to see what
the athletes have in store.
"The first meet is usually
the meet that you work out all
the kinks, but we didn't have
to," said Grabus. "Everyone
looked strong."

With a solid meet to their
credit early in the season, the
Bullets are out of the blocks
and ready to race. On Satur
day they will face several con
ference rivals at the Franklin &c
Marshall Invitational.

Prior to facing Johns Hopkins last night, Lady Bullets record at 10-6, 5-4 C.C.

From Gettysburg Times
Presswire
Carrie Kulp and Kelsey
Williams both posted 17 points
to lead five Bullets in double
figures and propel the Gettys
burg squad over Dickinson, 78
64, in Centennial Conference
action on Wednesday. With the
victory, the Bullets' record im
proved to 10-5 overall and 5
3 in conference play.
The Bullets trailed 31-29
at the end of the first half, but
out-scored the Red Devils, 49
33, in the second half to pull
out the win.
Kulp also pulled down a
season-best 11 rebounds for
her second double of the sea
son. Jamie Dawson added 14
points and a career high, game
leading 16 rebounds for her
fourth double-double of the
1999-2000 campaign.

Mandy Wilson also
scored in double figures for the
Bullets with a season-high 14
points, while Steph Drevna
added another 10 points.
Despite a slow start that
left both scores in single digits
for the first six minutes,
Dickinson managed to garner
a game-opening eight-point
lead of a 10-2 run, seeing their
first two baskets off of coast
to-coast steals by Sweeta
Hutchinson and Kim Selemba.

The Red Devil run ended
after Drevna fouled Kristi
Pugh. Pugh sank her two from
the charity stripe and then
fouled Drevna the next time
down the court. Drevna sank
the tail end of her two, but the
Bullets would remain sluggish
as Dickinson rallied for another
eight points, pushing the score
to 21-9 at the 10:12 mark.
With time running out in
the first, the Bullets renewed
their offensive efforts and made
a late-half run to pull within
two of the Red Devils. Follow
ing a basket by Pugh, Kulp bur
ied four foul shots and a bucket
to start the Gettysburg come
back, which found the Bullets
out-s"onng their opposition,
20-10.

While Kulp pushed the
Bullets to the bucket, Wilson
and Williams pushed for
Dickinson turnovers and
grabbed seven combined first
half steals. Wilson led Gettys
burg with five steals on the
night, while Williams grabbed
a career-best four steals. Jay
Hodge tied her career-best four
steals. It would take the Bullets
seven minutes in the second
half to gain the lead, as the Red
Devils fought back with buck
ets from Hutchinson, Selemba
and Kristin Brady. Selemba
would finish the contest with a
game-high 19 points.
The Bullets, who shot 33

percent from the field, would
end the game with a 15-7 run.
Gettysburg held a 53-42 ad
vantage in rebounds and a 28
35 advantage in turnovers.
Gettysburg then trav
eled to Swarthmore to face
the Garnet Tide.
Gettysburg forward
Megan McDonald had a ca
reer day, but Swarthmore's
Heather Kile led four players
in double figures with 15
points and added 17 re
bounds to pace the Garnet to

a 55-53 win.
McDonald poured in a
career-high 24 points and
added a team-high eight re
bounds as the Bullets fell to
10-6 (5-4 CC). The senior
forward, who had missed the
previous game due to an
ankle injury, knocked down
three 3-pointers to double her
career total and added one
blocked shot in 33 minutes.
For her career performance,
McDonald was named to the
Centennial Conference
Weekly Honor Roll

Kelsey Williams added
seven points for Gettysburg
while Jay Hodge scored six.
Carrie Kulp and Steph
Drevna - the team's two lead
ing scorers - were held to five
points on the evening, 19
points below their combined
season average.
Swarthmore out-re
bounded Gettysburg 47-34

Senior Megan McDonald was named to the Centennial
Conference Weekly Honor Roll after a career-high
performance Saturday.

on the evening while holding the
Bullets to 28.3 percent (17-for
60) shooting from the floor.
The women entered last
night's game against Johns

Hopkins in third place, two
games behind Franklin 8c
Marshall.

Records Fall Early for Bullets Track Team

by Lauren Davis
Staff Writer
After weeks of training
and goal-setting, the Gettys
burg track team finally reached
the season's starting line at
Dickinson College's
DuCharme Relays this past
weekend. Both the men's and
women's teams turned in excel
lent performances, but the
meet was just a glimpse of the
promise that this talented team
shows.
The women's team col
lected seven top three perfor
mances in the meet. Although
early in the season, the sprint¬

ers were already in stellar form,
collecting first-places in the
4x200 and 4x400 meter relays
and a 2nd place in the 55m re
lay. The 4x200-meter team of
seniors Anne Schenck and Andi
Thent and juniors Keri Hymen
and Courtney Hurd_, estab
lished a new school record of
1:52.34. Hymen, Hurd, and
Thent later combined efforts
with freshman Joanna Silver to
win the 4x400m relay in
4:22.55, defeating conference
rival Dickinson by two seconds,
and a Schenck-Thent duo com
prised the 55m relay team.
Schenck, who qualified
for the NCAA Championships

in the long jump last year,
proved herself to be on her
way to another successful sea
son, breaking the school
record in the long jump with
a leap of 17' 1-1/2".
Junior Alaine Duffy
joined her in taking third in
the long jump relay with a
combined distance of 30' 8 1/
2". Gettysburg collected
three more second place per
formances from the high
jump, 55-meter hurdle, and
sprint medley relay teams.
Cathy Spangler had a great
day throwing the shot put
34'4-l/2".
On the men's side, the

Bullets showed their depth in all
events with five top three perfor
mances spread among the
throws, jumps, sprints, and dis
tance events.
Seniors Mike Williams and
Scott Grabus combined efforts to
win the shot put relay, with a dis
tance of 82'2".
The sprinters took two sec
ond-place awards in the 4x200
and 4x400 meter relays, finish
ing just behind Dickinson in both
events. Freshman Phil Ferraro
joined juniors Nick LaPorta, Jeff
Cumpson and J.T. Farrell in the
4x200 with a time of 1:38.63.
The 4x400 team composed of
LaPorta, Cumpson, Farrell, and
Chris Buchanan ran 3:36.34.

Gettysburg also won two
third-places from the high jump
relay team of Chris Russo and
Sam Shipley and the 5000
meter relay team of Jason Rose
and Al Franyo.
Shipley's first-place per
formance in the 55-meter dash
earned him the Silver Spike.
On the women's side, sopho
more Lauren Davis received the
award for her performance on
the 4x800-meter and distance
medley relay teams.
Head Coach Bob
Condon was pleased with his
team's performance. Although
there was no team scoring, he

Western Maryland, Swarthmore
Ineffective at Bulletproofing

by Molly Clark
Staff Writer
The Gettysburg men and women's
swim teams both had double wins in the
last week.
On January 26, the teams traveled
to Western Maryland, and last Saturday
they visited Swarthmore. Both the
women and men defeated the Western
Maryland Green Terror 78-7 and 66
19, respectively.
Emily Williams, Liz Janelle,
Heather Gallagher, Karin Olmsted,
Julia Girman, Kris Nessler, Chris Hill,
and Craig Wilson all experienced
double wins in the water. In addition
to these double wins, both teams were
able to take first place in all events but
one. While the Western Maryland meet
may have been just another routine win
for the Bullets, the Swarthmore swim
mers promised to be much tougher
competition for both teams; the Gar
net Tide entered the meet undefeated
in the Centennial Conference.

Facing the talented Swarthmore
squads was challenge enough, but the
Gettysburg swimmers were forced to
face the meet without team leader Kelly
Brennan. On Thursday, the senior co
captain suffered a broken leg resulting
from an ice-induced fall on campus.
Brennan did attend the meet, and
her presence serves as an inspiration to
her teammates.

spectively, set the mood for the rest of
the meet.
Leupold said, "It was definitely
one of the toughest [meets] this season,
but everyone was able to step it up when
the points were needed. There were a
lot of good times, and I am sure that
we are now more prepared for this
weekend."
The final score for the men was
Gettysburg 109, to Swarthmore 93.
The women had an equally good
meet. Freshman Bneanne Pullis cap
tured two wins in the two distance
events along with freshman Liz "BUG"
Janelle who won both the 200 Indi
vidual Medley and the 200 backstroke.
Other winners were Karin "Sted,
peace out" Olmsted and Missy West,
who in addition to placing first once
again, broke a pool record in the 200
breaststroke.

Kim Gaffney put it well when she
said "We all needed to come together
as a team in order to prove our strength.
We did and proved that no team is bul
letproof."
Both teams finished strongly, cap
turing the meet-ending 400 freestyle
relay to show who really was the better
of the two teams.
Last night the Bullets travelled to
Dickinson, to face the Red Devils in
conference action. The swim teams will
try for an undefeated season in Centen
nial Conference competition when they
face the Franklin & Marshall Diplomats
this Saturday in a 2 p.m. meet at home.
Both teams were inspired by a full
house at their last home meets and hope
to have the same showing when they
say goodbye to the seniors who will be
swimming in the CUB pool for the last
time.

Commenting on Brennan's condi
tion, sophomore swimmer BethAnn
Mulvihill said, "Despite her disappoint
ment after her injury, she showed a lot

of team spirit. It's a huge loss but I think
that our team is strong enough to pull
through and succeed."
And succeed they did. Sean

O'Connor and David Lavigne each
pulled in two wins. A strong one-two
three finish in the 100 freestyle by Tom
Leupold, Jon Hegna and Nessler, re-
