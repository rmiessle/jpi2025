College Bookstore loses revenue,
seeks solutions

By Nadine Hoffman
News Editor
Recently, many student!) have ex
pressed apprehension in regards to the

debate over
textbook sales.
Questions have
been raised
about whether
the College
Bookstore
might consider
restricting ac
cess to outside
sources like
Internet book
sellers.
Last
week, a student
employee of the
post office cited
an incident in
which a mem
ber of the ad
ministration en
tered the inner
part of the of
fice and re
corded the
names of
Gettysburg stu
dents who had

Scandal in the College Post Office? Questions answered about the
questionable actions of administrators to monitor students book-buying
trends.

received packages from online book
companies. In response to his concern
regarding the incident, senior Damien
Thaxter drafted a letter, "College moni
tors online bookbuying," which ap
peared in the February 3,2000, edition
of The Gettysburgian.
Peter North, the Assistant Direc
tor of Financial Planning and Budget,
whom Thaxter witnessed recording stu
dents' names, denied any foul play, al
though he did admit to writing down
"six or seven names."
Why did North record this infor
mation?
"What better way to study the is
sue of book buying than to look at the
names of students using online compa
nies?" questioned North.
North gathered these names after
the College Post Office turned down a
previous request to send a list of online

by online companies.
North said he is concerned about
marketing tactics used by large online
retail companies which can trick buy
ers into purchasing old editions of text
books. He remarked on buying online,
"I'm just concerned that students are
being misinformed."
One dilemma for the Bookstore
which occurs as a result of online text
book purchasing is that students buy
their books from the bookstore, then
order them cheaper through the
internet, and return the books they
originally purchased tor a full retund.
The College loses money repackaging
these used goods. Furthermore, the
Bookstore has been forced to return
books to the publishers they order from
because less are being purchased than
anticipated. This process incurs re
stocking fees.

book-buyeis to the administration, on
the basis of students' rights to privacy
Noith aimed to find out which Internet
outhttei s ai e sending books to students
with the intention of _toiming a book
store committee to learn more about
services provided

North insisted that the College
Bookstore is seeking a way to make
books moie affordable to purchase.
When asked it he would personally re
soit to an online company to save
money, he said, "If I knew my school
was trying to be fair about it, yes, I might

pay a little more for my
books, but not an exor
bitant amount."
The College Book
store marks up book
prices 25 peicent, the
industry average profit
margin. Textbook res
ervation, which the Col
lege encourages, elimi
nates this inflated price.
The list of names
gathered then landed in
the hands of Kim Wolf,
Supervisor of the Col
lege Bookstore, who
stated that it remained
on her desk for a few
days before it was de
stroyed in a shredder.
Nothing was done with
the information, both
Wolt and North assert.
Wolf's goal en
tails creating a student
advisory board com
posed of a broad range

of constituents in order to receive stu
dent feedback and determine what, if
any, modifications the Bookstore must
make to remain viable and competitive
as a book selling enterprise.
Wolf sent a notice to the student
digest earlier this year requesting vol
unteers for such a committee, but re
ceived only three responses. She also
discussed the matter before Student Sen
ate, encouraging student interaction
with faculty to make the store more con
ducive to their needs. While Wolf ap
preciates positive feedback, she said "I
thrive on negative responses so we can
learn what students want."
When asked whether she would
choose online book selling corporations
as opposed to a college bookstore with
higher prices, she replied, "I would have
to say I'd buy online if there was a sig
nificant savings."

The Blotter: A weekly look at campus
crime across the nation

By William Lee Campus
Correspondent-Western
Illinois University
JACKSON, Miss. (TMS)
— A lawsuit filed by a former
Jackson State University police
officer who claims he was
wrongfully fired has stirred up
a ruckus on campus that in
volves allegations of rape and
an administrative cover-up.
School officials won't
discuss the matter because it's
pending in court. But some
who are close to the case sug
gest that the former police of¬

ficer is bitter because the alle
gations of rape involve a
woman who is now his wife.
Keith D. Brown, fired
from the campus police force
in August 1998, filed suit in a
Jackson U.S. District Court
Feb. 4. According to court
records, Brown is accusing
former JSU police chief Frazier
Bolton and former JSU presi
dent James E. Lyons of cover
ing up the results of a 1997
rape investigation involving a

former student and former
Mississippi state Rep Alfred L.
Walker. According to court
records, the alleged student
victim worked as a page in
Walker's office and confided in
Brown that Walker had sexu
ally assaulted her. Brown's
lawsuit also states that the
young woman became preg
nant with Walker's child.
Walker, who was first
elected to the state house in
1987, did not run for re-elec
tion last year. He could not be
reached for comment. Brown,
who eventually married the al
leged victim, claims that
Bolton fired him after he
started looking into the young
woman's allegations against
Walker.
Bolton and Lyons deny
any wrongdoing and claim that
Brown was fired because of his
poor work performance.

UNIVERSITY PARK,
Perm. (TMS) — Members of
Penn State's chapter of Sigma
Alpha Epsilon recently woke
up to find a couple of strange
and shaggy visitors in the
house: two sheep.

The apparent prank has
landed a couple of Penn State
students in trouble. Police
charged Anthony Tricanchi,
18, and Luke Garretson, 19,
with criminal mischief for
stealing the sheep from a lo
cal agriculture college on Jan.
29. Members of the frater
nity were awakened by the
noise made by the two fright
ened animals.

MACOMB_, 111. (TMS)
— An Illinois federal court le
cently ordered officials fiom
Western Illinois University to
pay a former faculty member
$200,000 after he failed to
have his contract renewed for
having a fistfight with a pro
fessor.
The Peoria Federal
Court found on Jan. 27 that
WIU administrators unfairly
refused to re-hire Barry Ander
son for another year, allegedly
because of a fight that took
place between him and a law
enforcement and justice ad
ministration professor Robert
Reinertsen in Nov. 1994. The
lawsuit named several WIU

officials, including president
Donald Spencer, as well as the
formei chairman of the LEJA
department.
Specifically, Anderson's
lawsuit stated that WIU sought
revenge against him for speak
ing publicly about the alterca
tion, even accusing Reinertsen
of having a violent temper. Ac
cording to the Macomb Jour
nal, the fight was over teach
ing assignments within the
LEJA department. Andeison's
suit also accuses administrators
of refusing to hire him despite
a committee's recommenda
tion that he be re-hued.
The $200,000 is made up
of $150,000 in lost wages,
$ 10,000 for emotional distress
and $15,000 in punitive dam
ages. Spencer and other offi
cials were ordered to pay a to
tal of $25,000.

Accoiding to the
Macomb Journal, Anderson
was the third person to file a
lawsuit over the incident.
Reinertsen and a member of
WIU's Office of Public Safety
filed suits claiming the univer
sity violated their rights.

Editor-in-Chief
Monday is the big day, and the card and candy makers
will not let us forget it. There is a large number of people
out there who think that Valentine's Day should be wiped off
the calendar forever. Obviously, we are the people who do
not have a "significant other" (s.o.) this Valentine's Day.
Valentine's Day was a happy day until about fourth grade,
when we stopped exchanging valentines with everyone in our
class. For us, it is now a day of pure misery, when our lack of
a s.o. is clearly shown. So what do we do this Monday night,
without someone special to share it with? Here's a list that
I've come up with (with the help of my many single friends).
1. Sit in your room with some Ben &C Jerry's and cry.
2. Pretend it's just any other day and conduct business as
usual.
3. Hit on every guy/girl/farm animal you see in hopes of get
ting a s.o. by the end of the evening.
4. (Over 21) Go to the Pub and get wasted.
(Under 21) Go to LD's and just be happy.

Valentine's Day
for the
independent heart

5. Hang out with other single people.
6. Crash someone else's date.
7. Send yourself roses.
8. Listen to sappy music.
9. Read a trashy romance novel.
10. Call the psychic hotline.
11. Write a nasty letter to an ex.
12. Flirt with someone on the Internet.
13. Think up evil sayings for those little candy hearts.
14. Send evil valentines to people.
15. Watch romantic comedies and boo at the end.
16. Watch tragic love stories and cheer at the end.
17. Leave town and spend the night in a cave.
IK. One word: Chocolate.
19. Go see The Talented Mr. Ripley; it'll give you something
to think about.
20. Make hearts out of red construction paper and burn them
with a few close friends.

Haaland's Hijinks

President Gordon Haaland took a break from his busy schedule on Saturday to join some
students playing snow football. Senior Brent LaRosa(back left of picture) evaluated Haaland's
playing abilities, saying "He carries the ball well; maybe Coach Streeter should recruit him for
the College football team." Said senior Damien Thaxter, "I was caught completely off guard
and gained a newfound respect for him... I'm glad he was on my team."

The magic of Harry Potter

New York- _Scholastic Inc.

1997. 109 pp.
J.K. Rowling's series of
books about Harry Potter, a
young wizard just learning the
trade, has spent a good deal of
time camping out at the top of
the New York Times bestseller
list. It seems as though little
Hdrry Pottei h_.is captivated and
entranced children and parents
alike. After spending a week
end with my nine year-old
cousin and hearing all about
Harry, I decided to find out for
myself why everyone is reading
Hai ry Potter.
Hany Potter and the
Sorceier's Stone, the fust of
thiee books about Harry, starts
with an orphaned Hany living
in the cupboaid of his evil aunt
and uncle's house (think

Cindeiella and hei step
mother). Hairy, who has an
odd knack for making impos
sible things happen, is always
getting into trouble with his
aunt and uncle, not to mention
fueling his cousin's constant
teasing. Harry is rescued from
his impossible living situation
when he receives a surprise in
vitation to attend Hogwarts
School of Witchcraft and Wiz
ardry. With much protest from
his aunt and uncle who, like
many of us, don't believe in
magic, Harry sets off for
Hogwarts to learn not only the
art of wizardry, but also to dis
cover who he is and who his
parents were. It's not until
Harry arnves at Hogwarts, owl,
cloak and wand m hand, that
his real adventures begin.

"The Sorcerer's Stone" is
full of twists and turns, adven
ture and mystery. Rowling does
a remarkable job of stirring her
readers' imaginations, using her
talent and creativity to produce
a well-written work in which
humans become muggles and
the Ministry ot Magic controls
the law of the land. With a little
magic, Rowling brings together
all the basic elements of child
hood: family, school, teachers,
friends, rivals and even spoits,
to create wli,ir is sure to be a

classic children's book
Although the seemingly
universal appeal of Hany and
his /irlven- .

tures is understandable, unfor
tunately foi a college student
with the promise of a semester
of hard work ahead, this is one
book that might be better off
placed aside. Apothecanes and
transfiguration may be fun no
matter what your age, but
vomit flavored jelly beans and
three-headed dogs named
Fluffy are a lot more endearing
when you don't have labs and
seminars to woiry about. So
unless you're finished all of
your work for the semester or
you're dying to escape the land
of the muggles, I suggest leav
ing this one for the kids.

Girl explores line between crazy and normal

by Aliison Smail
Staff _Reportfr
"Girl, Interrupted" does
not present viewers with many
light-hearted laughs, nor does
it offer suspenseful, nail-biting
moments that might be found
in "Scream 3." In fact, those
who seek a fun-filled night at
the movie theater should steer
clear of Winona Ryder's new
est picture. But for those who
dare to see life through the eyes
of a sullen, disillusioned JS
year-old girl, this film will pro
vide rewarding food tor
thought.
"Girl, Interrupted,"
based on author Susanna
Kaysen's 1993 memoir, stars
Ryder ("Reality Bites," "The
Age of Innocence") as Susanna,
a recent high-school graduate
who finds herself in a mental

ward following her suicide at
tempt. When she first arrives,
Susanna feels confused, and
she ks angry that she lives
among psychopaths, patho
logical liars, and a girl who
thrives on a rotissene chicken
and laxative diet.
She also meets the hell
raising Lisa, played by talented
Angelina Jolie ("The Bone
Collector," "Gia"). Lisa has
lived in the ward for eight
years and verbally abuses the
other patients, who both fear
and respect her. She shows
Susanna the ward culture by
demonstrating how to hide the
pills that the nurses dole out,
by introducing Susanna to the
psychiatrist's private files, and
by showing her the best escape
routes for late-night adven
tures.

As the days pass, Susanna
grows accustomed to living in

the ward and to her hiends' bi
zarre habits. She finds refuge
in her journal, and the viewer
hears snippets of her honest,
thoughtful prose. But Susanna
learns that writing down her
thoughts will not offer a full
cure, because she doesn't fully
understand her disease.
She yearns to know why
she feels sad and isolated. Fur
thermore, she wants to know
what she must do to make a
graceful, satisfactory transition
from the inside of the institu
tion to the outside world.
Her doctor, a middle-aged
man who occasionally dozes
during meetings (played by Jef
frey Tambor of "Meet Joe
Black" and "There's Something
About Mary"), offers her a
vague diagnosis and an even fog
gier prognosis. He tells her that
she has Borderline Personality
Disorder. That is, Susanna feels

uncei tain about her self-image,
relationships, sexuality, and
long-term career plans.
She also experiences
boredom and persistent emp
tiness. The doctor st\ys _that
while some people have
emerged unscathed by the ill
ness, many have succumbed to
suicide.
As the viewer observes
Susanna and hears the doctor's
charges of empty relationships
and loneliness filed against her,
he or she may feel panicked.
Susanna's emotions strike a
fnghteningly familiar chord.
Doesn't every person experi
ence self-doubt and confusion?
Surely not all of us belong in
asylums, do we? And Susanna
seems like such a "normal"
teenager. It appears that she
could have just as easily pro
ceeded to college as she did to
a mental ward.

Ryder offers a convinc
ing portrayal of the depressed
patient. In interviews, the ac
tress has disclosed that she
once spent time in a mental
hospital in an attempt to over
come her anxieties. This ex
perience undoubtedly helped
her make the movie true-to
hfe. Jolie and Whoopi

Goldberg ("Ghost," "Sister
Act"), who plays a blunt yet
compassionate nurse, also
boost the quality of the movie.
Of course, "Girl, Inter
rupted" is not without fault.
Perhaps in an effort to illustrate
just how sad Susanna feels, sev
eral long scenes simply show
her melancholy, tear-stained
face. The producers could have
omitted half of them and the
viewer would still realize the
depths of Susanna's despair.
Several critics have called
"Girl, Interrupted" a poor
knock-oft of "One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest." But they
should realize that the goals of
the two movies differ, and
therefore should not be com
pared with one another.
Whereas the latter focuses on
the injustices of the mental
health system, "Girl, Inter
rupted" shows the challenges
and relationships that one pa
tient must confront in order to

re-society.
It also forces the viewer
to confront his or her stereo
types of who belongs in men
tal institutions. And "Girl, In
terrupted" meets both goals
while providing the viewer
with a rewarding, thought-pro
voking experience.

Taxing questions,

BY LlBBY MUSSELMAN
Dear Libby,
Where aie the tax foims
usually kept on the fiont desk?
Don't you know that it is tax
season? (I)iving R. (S)tudent
Deai IRS,
That's clever (your signa
ture), but you must have missed
the fact that we're the eighth
most wired college in the na
tion, which requires us, of
course, to be the eighth most
wired library. And since we're
so wired, we no longer deal in
printed tax forms. That's so
passe. Let your fingers do the
walking in Muscat and type in
a title or keyword search on
"tax forms." Voila. You can
find them all on the Digital
Daily. That's the Department
of the Treasury's answer to be
ing the eighth most wired gov
ernment agency. Select print
and you're on your way.

The only print tax forms
on campus are the non-resident
forms, which are at the Off
Campus Studies office.
Deai Libby,
I think it would be _gieat
if everyone would get a locker
at the library because it makes
my life so much easier. (Un¬

signed)
Dear Locker Lover,
Thank you for taking the
time to express your apprecia
tion, something in short supply
around here. The library has
135 lock- ers, many

would like to keep

- conveniently in the
_^_ ^^ library, stop
(\r ^~~~~ ~*~~~ _^-~ ¦ ) by the
| I circula
tion desk
for a combination lock and
locker assignment.
Deai Libby,
Please put in bettei light
ing and more individual desk
lamps. Unsigned
Dear Light Deprived,
Libby checked with direc
tor Robin Wagner who said
that the library got 20 new
floor lamps in December which

have been put in the reading
bays. She said she hopes to be
gin replacing tables and carrels
in the library soon. All new
tables will have centralized task
lighting.
Study break: Libby says
take a break tonight at 7:30 and
do something for your mind.
Stop by the Media Theater,
where Temple University Pub
lic Radio's Jazzman Jack
Buerkle will be talking about
"Jazz: America's Music" and
playing some tunes. Get
away from those dimly lit study
carrels and online tax forms
and take a break.
Hearts to Pat Tully in the
Library Technical Services de
partment who devised a way
for you to renew youi own
books online. No moie
overdues! Pretty nice!
From Muscat select the
option "View Youi _Cuculation
Record / Renew Items."

Enter your name, ID
number (don't entei the zeioes
at the end of the number) and
your MUSCAT PIN (Peisonal
Identification Number). If you
do not have a MUSCAT PIN
you can make one up (any com
bination of up to 30 chaiacters
and/or numbers) and take it
from there.

If you had a PIN number
and forgot it, come to the cir
culation desk with your ID card
and the staff can delete your
old PIN and you can start over
from scratch.
Daits to the thief who is
clever with the exacto knife,
and decided to cut the black
and white photographic plates
out of four expensive art books.
I thought I'd let your pals know
where then tuition dollars are
being spent. This should make
them real happy.
Instead of something

new, we'll be spending at least
$ 100 each to replace Portraits
by Helmut Newton, John
_Deaknt: Photographs, Vogue
Photographs De Mode, and
Philippe Halsman: A ReUospec
twe—and that's if we can even
find them on the out of print
market. All because you're
some kind of psycho person.
What's wrong with you? Were
you out of coins for the pho
tocopy machine? Or did you
just have to have some new ai t
work on your walls? You're a
total embairassment to
Gettysburg College.

Do you have a question
oi complaint about the library?
Send them to me at lmussel or

Thanks, not
complaints, are due
I feel that as students, we owe Fa
Lilities Sei vices, Housekeeping and
eveiyone involved with snow re
moval and clean-up last week a THANK
YOU. _Fheie was a ton of snow and
many puddles in the buildings, but ev
eryone took care of things as quickly
and as well as possible.
In last week's edition of The Get
tysburgtan, a young woman complained
that she was awakened by snow plows,
but also complained that enough snow
wasn't removed. I think it is impossible
in such weather to have everything spot
less of snow and ice; this is just part of

.
We should realize that this snow
happened overnight and in the other
case, over the weekend. The workers
left their families and friends to come
in early or come in on a day they usu
ally have off to be out in the cold shov
elmg/plowing snow. So I really don't
think we should be complaining, but
rather we should be thanking them for
their efforts.
To the writer of the letter: it is a
shame that you fell, but you know
what...you weren't alone...and I hope
that when we all have to shovel our own
snow/ice you will look back and appre
ciate what a luxuiy you had!

Consider This....

For a variety of reasons, Valentine's Day is one of the most ridicu
lous holidays of the year. Its commercialization rivals the mass mar
keting of Christmas and Easter, flooding stores and television with
maudlin images and sentiments many would rather ignore.
Furthermore, it is a holiday that reinforces a select group within
any population. Why should single, divorced or otherwise unattached
people suffer through the irritations of a day filled with candy, flowers
and cards that, following some twisted blueprint, pass us by?
Just as St. Patrick's Day has proven to be a haven for both the

can share their sorrows and revel in the comfort that stems from mu
tual distaste for others. Such festivities can occasionally serve as a
venue for that long sought-after ticket to the land of candy boxes, mes
sages-on-hearts and countless embraces.
So if you do have a so-called sweetheart, when buying bundles of
bonbons for your beloved, consider your less fortunate friends and buy
a little something for them too.

Irish (pretenders in tow) and the simple drunk
ard, Valentine's Day is in need of a renovation
to accommodate those unwilling or unable to
indulge in its quixotic sentimentality. Therefore,
society should adapt itself to accommodate the
large group (perhaps a majority) of people that
are presently excluded from the traditional Feb
ruary 14 festivities.
To start, restaurants should offer free meals
to single people on Valentine's Day. This sym
pathetic suggestion bears merit: it provides a
reasonable activity for the lonely, for whom con
solation often arrives in the form of an over-full

stomach. Restauranteurs could easily recoup
their losses by increasing the price of meals for
couples, who, blinded by impulsive affection, will
surely ignore both the altered menu and the
credit card slip.
Department stores, especially those stock
ing computers, big-screen TV's, satellite dishes
and related merchandise should offer significant
discounts. If some doubt their ability to give or
receive affection, doubts can be temporarily dis
missed as a new "toy" whose materialistic value
is surely comparable (on Monday only) to that
of genuine human affection, provides hours of
commercial entertainment.

Finally, more people should organize sym
pathy parties to provide a haven for the lost and
desolate on such a bleak, inequitable holiday.

I am not a pet son who
relishes most holidays because
if a life is to be well lived, then
everyday should reall\ be
treated like a holiday Except,
of course, those days when a
bookie comes and beats down
your door then hits you with
a crowbar and steals your _^ -
lewelry. Those days are /C"_,uS-

not much like a

holi- j

1 n _^'^^^^
fact, they aie moie ^^P
like an evil "I wish that God
never cursed me with life" holi
day. Regardless, the comma -
ciahsm of all the major holidays
is interesting to obseive, par
ticularly those holidays which
began as humble lehgious fes
tivals and are now an excuse for
diamonds. The Papal blessings
once bestowed upon
Valentine's Day are long since
gone, and Hallmark now wears
the grand Miter of righteous
ness as it opens up the Holy
Door of greed at exactly nine
o'clock each and every morn¬

ing. Those who have dis
missed me already are saying
"he's just another male bitter
that he's lonely on Valentine's
Day." Well, I suppose that is
part of the problem. However,
at least in my own petty psy
chosis, I am able to rationalize
many more excuses as to why
February 14 is the possible day
of judgement foretold in Rev
elation.
I have news for you
people - just cause it's got Saint
in front of it doesn't make it a
good day. On All Saint's Day
the dead are supposed to rise,
and that's not a pretty thought

now, is it? Don t be fooled by
the medieval terminology asso
ciated with this day - it is a day
on which every man must truly
fear for his life because he is to
be chastised with tears for buy
ing lingerie that he thought was
perfectly decent.
Now, mind you, this is
not entirely a gender-biased
event. Theie aie plenty ot men
who idealize about the possible
love which may be kindled or
cultivated on this day. I don't

SPy pai
vv day foi us gents because
' the ESPY awards just happen
to be on February 14, and that
just happens to be the one day
which we can't forget or else
we might as well kiss our sweet
companions goodbye. What a
_hornble conflict of interest, yet
I know that we all must put oui
noses to the grindstone and our
wallets to the test so that we
can show another in this world
that we love them. Those oth
ers are Hallmark and the local
jeweler who becomes ever so
nice at this time of year.
You are all reading this

with great malice, as was its
original intent, but this bitter
little man has not had all bad
experiences on Valentine's Day.
My first real girlfriend dumped
me for my best friend on the
said day, but that had no last
ing psychological trauma. I
received my first kiss on Val
entines Day once, but she too
left shortly after (about five
minutes to be exact). Still,
though I view myself as impar
tial to such things, I can assure
you at least one or two since
rlif n have been hetter.

For instance, I remember
a cute little girl in second grade
who gave me a valentine kiss
(actually hundreds of them)
while her friends were pinning
me clown. My sobs and cries

foi help were useless against
the shear torce which was
tin own at me on that lonesome
playground. My friends aban
doned me to this torture out of
fear foi their souls (because we
all knew it little boys kiss a girl
they go to hell).
As Valentines Day ap
proaches this year, 1 kind ot
wish I could rind that woman
If I could I would suavely walk
up to her and say "Hey baby,
you liked me then, how's about
now?" She'd probably call the
cops, but it is worth a tiy.

My i eal Valentine's bless
ing is not to follow the cliche,
which has beaten any bit of love
out of what should be a per
fectly decent day. Don't buy
diamonds or cards with neo
romantic babble on them. Go

It seems an appropriate
time, with the recent efforts of
the administration to appar
ently do away with the Greek
system, to evaluate the effects
of such a scenario. Naturally,
on one hand, 1 am vehemently
opposed to any change which
eliminates a student's freedom
of choice. On the other, how
ever, I am just as opposed to
the limits imposed by the Greek

system.
The Greek system, by
nature, is limiting a numbei of
the choices open to the previ
ously unaffihated student. For
a poignant example, all one has
to do is think back on the days
immediately prior to and fol
lowing bid day of their fresh-

their new gioup of friends, I
could find little criticism. But
before they know it's hap
pened, those few weeks turn
into the next four years of col
lege, and the damage is done.
It's taken me three full
years of college to realize who
I like and who I dislike. It's a
time-consuming and sometimes
grueling process which could
never conceivably be accom
plished in just a semester. Yet
these young people, with only
very basic common inteiests,
are being thrown together and
essentially forced to get along.
It's not a natural process for
selecting fi lends, nor is it par
ticularly healthy.

It follows the same
premise as prearranged mar
riages: it may not be what you
want, but you'll work it out. If

that's the method we use for
selecting oui friends, then it
doesn't say much for the faith
we have in one another. If you
adhere to the notion that the
ideal lover exists, then you
should apply the same stan
dards when choosing friends
instead of simply working with
what you are given.
As an independent, I have
had the privilege of getting to
know a numbei of people from
various ftatet nines and sorori
ties who have the qualities I
look for in a fnend. Unfortu
nately, these people have been
somewhat looted in the con
straints of the Greek system, so
they become good, but rarely
great friends. My case is rep
resentative of one that I suspect
permeates the entire campus
and is another unfortunate ex
ample of the indiscernible lim
iting powers of the Greek sys
tem.

A final word of consola
tion to those who were eluded
by the coveted bid last week:
congratulations, your college
experience is still open-ended
and holds enormous potential.
As much as there is to say for
foimals and steamy basement
parties, it is also highly com
mendable to resist the lure of
membership and security that
Greek life provides. To never
find companionship at college
would be an absolute tragedy,
but to do it, and do it unaided
is the _ultimate reward.

Republicans need to face the
facts before going public

by Christina Dickert
Political Columnist
Monday night's debate
showed the true colors of all
three political parties that are
viable on campus: the Demo
crats, the Socialists, and the
Republicans. While some par
ties might try to claim victory,
the Democrats are not going to
take that route. Instead, we are
going to acknowledge the fact
that the Senate-hosted debate
was intended to inform poten
tial voters about party stances
on certain issues so that they
can make informed choices

about the candidates and their
parties.
There weie no "win
ners," as some would like to
say. Instead, the truth behind
the Republican party's "toler
ance" on certain issues came to
light. With their nicely typed
responses to every type of ques
tion possible, the Republican
representatives read the "cor
rect" answer when asked a
question.
I'm sure to many, it may
have appeared that the Repub
licans had taken the time to
actually prepare for the debate.
To me, it seemed that they
could not think for themselves

and did not know how to speak
from their hearts. As they
droned on and on about the
"moral" obligations of the
American people, they couldn't
even show politeness by ac
knowledging the crowd with
some eye contact.
Aside from their body
language, many were offended
by the Republicans' blatant
apathy toward certain issues.
High on the list of complaints
was the status of the present
education system. The Repub
licans pressed the issue of
school choice with the assis
tance of vouchers. They in
sisted that, as Americans, we

should have the choice of
where our children should at
tend school.
The choice would be to
send our children to a "better"
school rather than a "bad"
school. A bad school would be
characterized by low test scores
where students just do not seem
to learn. Instead of giving stu
dents and families the option
of overcrowding the so-called
"good" schools, why can't the
government just eliminate this
rating of schools? Why can't
we take the money that would
be invested in the voucher pro
gram and use it to hire more
teachers, buy new and up-to
date textbooks, build additions
onto the so called bad schools
so children don't have to have
classes in cramped spaces, and
give oui children the education
they desei ve?

By claiming that there are
better schools out there, we are
condemning people who can't
afford to live in those "better"
school districts. By not invest
ing in their futures, we are just
following the cycle; by telling
those people that because they
did not have the same educa
tion as students in a private
school, they are not well quali
fied and therefore cannot be
held on the same level as people
who went to better schools.
Isn't the American dream
all about reaching a higher level
than the generation before? As

a nation, if we insist that if all
you can afford is to send your
children to a public school
where there are insufficient
materials to educate students
correctly, isn't it just going to
tell the children that they can
do no better than where they
are? We should be able to in
spire our children to reach tor
the stars, whether they live in
tile suburbs of Connecticut or
the Appalachian Trail in Ken
tucky. To inspire our teachers,
the government should raise
public school teacher wages.
Teaching in the public school

system is the most selfless thing
a teacher can do. There are no
tangible rewards for teaching in
the public school system. The
only real reward is inspiring a
child to do better. How can a
teacher do that if he or she does
not have enough money to
make ends meet?
I know teachers who have
to hold a second full time job
just to make ends meet. How
could they possibly be bright
and cheery when they are not
receiving what they deserve? In
my eyes and in many others',
the job of an educator is the
most important one a person
can hold. Teachers are the ones
who shape the future of our
nation by educating the next
generation. If the politicians
would please look further than
the edge of the podium that
holds their scripted answers,
they would realize that it is the
citizens, not the people spout
ing rhetoric, who shape our

.
Another issue that of
fended many people was the
Republicans' treatment of the
"moral obligation" of our na
tion. Please. The teaching of
"morals" do not belong in our
schools. In schools, we teach
respect, open-mindedness, and
tolerance. We do not need the
Republicans pushing their
Christian morals on our chil
dren. It you want vour children
to learn "moials", then teach
them at home. I believe that
instilling "morals" in our chil
dren is the family's responsibil
ity. Why should we constantly
push the responsibilities that
come with parenting onto our
already overburdened teach
ers? The oh-so-important job
of teaching our children what
is right and what is wrong is the
family's job.

Greek system

me, as they reflect a pattern
common when I was student
from 1991 to 1995.
In any case, let me make
a few comments about the
Greek system based on my ob
servations. In my view, the
Board of Trustees has not gone
far enough. This malignant
structure must be eradicated
once and for all.
When I was at Gettys
burg, the Greek system domi
nated social life and had a cor
rupting influence. I strongly
suspect this is still the case,
though I'm aware of piecemeal
reforms and declining member¬

ship in the last few years.
I vividly recall how the
Greek system changed the
mentality and behavior of so
many of my classmates.
Women in particular seemed
disconcerted. How heart
breaking it was to witness some
of them crying after not receiv
ing an invitation to a sorority.
I heard horror stones from new
members themselves about
how they were made to strip
to their underwear and told to
lose weight and get rid of blem
ishes on their skin.
No doubt many dietary
habits changed for the worse.
Eating disorders indeed were a

- continued pom page 11
common pioblem, though they
often went unaddressed. Per
haps representatives from the
Health Center can publicly dis
cuss their opinions on how the
Greek system affects the men
tal and physical health of stu
dents. The Greek system took
its toll on members in every
way imaginable. Obligations
such as rush, pledging, parties,
and basic mundane activities
consumed immense amounts of
time and energy. The academic

lives of many suffered. Greeks
established relationships, some
times meaningful, but mostly
superficial, and always con
trived.
Almost without variation
Greeks relegated their identi
ties to their own fraternities or
sororities. They frequently
were coerced to dress in a par
ticular way. And all this for
what? For a sense of security
and a feeling of being included.
The price for a _safety net of
brothers or sisters was the op
portunity to profoundly ex
plore one's individuality.

This is not to imply that
all Greeks were constricted.
Truth be told, many of my most
accomplished classmates were
Greeks, and they distinguished

themselves in areas such as aca
demics, athletics, and volunteer

service.
These individuals were so
outstanding that they would
have flourished no matter what
the environment. Bat others
were not as gifted and needed
to develop in a culture without
such a system that demanded
uncritical loyalty and created
inexorable tension. I firmly
believe that many classmates
who finished with middling
averages would have been great
had it not been for Greek life.
So much potential was

wasted at Gettysburg College,
and undoubtedly still is. To
deny the pernicious effect of
the Greek system is ostrich
hke. I am perplexed that these
exclusive, outdated social clubs
are allowed on campus, even
considering the enoimous po
litical and economic influence
of Greek alumni. Enough is
enough already. The time is
ripe to ehmmate the structure
that weighs down a college
community dizzy with possibil
ity. Sincerely,

Gay couples should not be excluded from
family values

by Rachel Hanson
Coiumnlni
Though gays and lesbians
have always existed, they have
only lecenth been awaided the
rights and respect thev desei ve
as human beings. Gays and les
bians are holding successful
marches and demonstrations in
an attempt to make society
more aware of the discrimina
tion they face daily, and thev
have formed communities ._ind

suppoit gioups so they can
have sate places to just "be
themselves." However, society
still has veiy fai to go.
Under out cunent system
ot "don't ask, don't tell," no
person who is homosexual may
be open about then sexuality
it they wish to serve in oui
nation's mihtaiy. This despi
cable policy forces the men and
women who have volunteered
to tight toi and defend oui
country to pretend that one of
the most h_/isic elements of" then

lives does not exist.
In 1996, Congi ess passed
and Piesident Clinton signed
the "Defense of Marriage Act,"
which defined inainage as "the
legal union between one man
and one woman." This act
thereby prohibits same-sex
couples from receiving suivivoi
and pension benefits, tax
breaks, and othei advantages
granted to married couples. As
a lesult of this act, gays and les
bians have not been able to ex
el cise then basic rights to a
govei nment-i ecognized and
protected union, which puts
them at a gi eat disadvantage in
oui society Many consei vatives have

claimed that gays and lesbians
should not be allowed to many
because it defies "ti achtional"
mainage. _Howevei, one must
remember that "traditional"
marriages weie once only
gi anted to members of the
same lace. Times change,
though, and thankfully this no
longer is tiue. "Traditional"
marriages also once dictated
that women were essentially
property of their husbands and
were told they must always
obey their husbands. Thank
fully, this too has changed. Our
society needs to keep changing
and allow any two people who
love each other, regardless of
what sex they are, to have a

accepted by the United States,
while Guatemalan and El Sal
vadonan refugees were sent
back to the brutal governments
in those countries, often to face
a certain death.
The determining factor is
whether the people are fleeing
a socialist or capitalist country.
The overriding concern of U.S.
foreign policy is the preserva
tion of capitalism and the open
ing up of all countries to U.S.
corporate domination.
The intense controversy
over little'Elian Gon/ale/. is

The National Oiganiza
tion foi Women has named
homosexual issues, especially
those pertaining to lesbians, as
one of the most impoitant on

veiy hai d to get gays and lesbi
ans out of the margins of soci
ety and make their issues
eveiyone's issues. In fact, for
most feminists, protecting the
rights ot gays and lesbians is
extremely important.
I personally know a num
bei ot homosexuals, most ot
whom are lesbians langmg in
^\ge t rom 2! to 60. These les
bians aie the most interesting,
dynamic, and canng people 1
know And since one majoi
aspect of their lives is so ditfei
ent fiorn mine, they have an
entirely different outlook on
life than I do.

Many people are fearful
that gays and lesbians will nega
tively affect children and essen
tially "make them gay," so they
feel that gays and lesbians
should not be able to teach chil
dren, much less raise them.
However, I have found that
gays and lesbians make excel

country went socialist, just as

Some of these Cuban ex

number of wonderful qualities
as a result of being raised by
two lesbians (I am not imply
ing, though, that two hetero
sexual paients could not pro
duce similar children) They
are extremely open-minded,
accepting, and tolerant of oth
ers. And, contrary to what con
servatives would like you to
believe, they were not "made
gay" by their two mothers -
they are all heteiosexual. Gays
and lesbians parent some of the

most well-adjusted, compas
sionate, and personable people
I have evei met.
Lesbianism in our society
is especially interesting to ex
amine. Foi the most part, there
aie thiee different opinions
people have about lesbianism -
it is an accepted and tolerated
difference in people, it is seen
as disgusting and intolerable, or
it is seen as something erotic for
heterosexual men. Therefore,
many "accept" lesbians not as
human beings deserving re
spect, but as objects that plea¬

sure men.
I think it is time that all
gays and lesbians are allowed
to be open about who they are
and be treated and accepted by
others as people. As people,
they should be allowed to
marry, have children, and live
in peace as the rest of us do.

Debate
continued ft oui page 1

That biings me to an
other point in my argument_,
the state of the American fam
ily, another favorite topic ot the
Republican rhetoric. The Re
publicans want a return to the
traditional family - two hetero
sexual married parents raising
their children. Lrke I said at
the debate, and I wrll state once
again here, it's never going to
happen.
The Republicans argue
that we as Democrats are ide
alists, but who is being ideal in

this situation? The divorce rate
is over 50%, as it has been for
the past decade. The number
of single parent families is
growing faster than ever. Are
we just to dismiss those chil
dren who are products of di
vorces and single parent fami
lies? Can we just ignore them?
Many people who come from
single parent families (includ
ing myself) would agree that
their lives are better off than
they would be if their parents
had gotten married or re
mained together.

"Staying together for the
sake of the children" is the
most ridiculous concept that
has ever come into existence.
In many cases, if the parents
had stayed together, everyone's
lives would have been miser
able, checkered by instances of
arguments, hostilities, and, in
_nvany 'instances.' 'domestic

abuse. The height of the Repub
licans' embarrassment was at
the end of the debate when a
question was posed regarding
their stance on gay rights.
Once again, the Republicans
read from their script, stating
that they were against any spe
cial legislation tor homosexu
als because, unlike race or gen
der, homosexuality is some
thing a person can control.
Please! If they are nearly
as educated as they claim to be,
they would know that in recent
years, geneticists have pin
pointed a gene that determines
sexuality. Republicans, once
again, I offer the suggestion
that you do your research be
fore you suggest something
publicly.

Save us the time of your
embarrassing and offensive
statements. Wake up and smell
the roses of the REAL 21st cen
tury. There are poor children
from single parent homes go
ing to schools where, in the
schoolbooks_, the Cold War is
still going on, and they have to
squeeze into the classrooms be
cause there aren't enough
teachers or space to have two
classes. Until you can solve the
problems of today, do not claim
victory. When these problems
are solved, it won't be a parti
san victory. The real winners
wrll be ,the American public.

Surely there's a statistic

The all- _^ *"
nighters m
which you're
having fun don't
necessarily
count. Sure,
you're propping your eyes
open for the sunrise, but if
you're on a deserted beach with
last night's blind date after a
soul-searing 12 hours, you
don't complain.
No, it's when you're rac
ing to meet an 8 a.m. deadline,

downing bad instant coffee be
cause you can't afford the per
colation time and falling asleep
on your computer, that you
know you're in deep.
There are two, perhaps
three, results. If you're lucky,
you pull it off. Called by des
peration, the rest of your pro
spectus plunges full-formed
from the heavens, to flow
through your honeyed fingers.
You're just that good - you tell
yourself as you collapse in ex
haustion at 8:01 a.m. - that you
do your most efficient work in

. Right.
But perhaps you just can't
pull it off. It's 7 a.m, you'ie
on youi tenth cottee, and you
decide to tie oft loose ends and
make,excuses., It isn't always «

long to learn that procrastina
tion is bad? You plot out your
work for the next week, the
next month, the year. You
wield your monogrammed pen,
the one your mother gave you
for graduation, just like the
models in the planner catalog.
That is, until the next all
nighter.
It's procrastination, of
course, and by now I'm con
vinced that it's inescapable.
Maybe a truly dreadful shock
might be a cure: "20 children
eaten by hungry lions; shocked
community blames procrasti
nating student!"
But then again, even that
might not be enough. I know
I've gone through about 10
cycles of organization in the
last eight years, most in the af
termath of all-night cram ses
sions. And none of them have
Listed.

So I know I procrastinate.
And at least thiee-quarters of
my ti lends, students and oth
eis, seem to have a problem
with lit,i too. It's, paiticularly

diamatic toi us graduate stu
dents; the sudden transition to
independent reseaich makes it
very easy to blow off that the
sis. There's even a special de
giee - given with tongue firmly
in cheek - tor the guy who's
been working on his Ph.D. for
10 years. A.B.D., or "all but
disseitation."
And as I get older, I've
found mvselt much more likely

to take the thud
option that I
hinted at before.
Maybe I can get it
done, maybe I
won't, but if I'm
tiuly in a bind,
time is short and
sleep is good and
I'm as likely to
write it off and
deal with it in the
morning. It
doesn't make
quite as dramatic a
story, but I have
enough of those
already.

I guess ev
eryone finds a method or two
for coping. The "ball-over-the
fence" method has occasionally
worked for me, although it of
ten leads to even more trouble.
According to this theory, you
take some irrevocable step that
will ruin your life if you don't
start working on whatever you
need to do. Perhaps you sched
ule your "we've been dating for
six whole months" dinner with
your girlfriend for the night
before that literature review is
due. Immediate fear is quite a
motivator.
So after the hundredth
sleepless night I've come to an
agreement with myself. I pro
crastinate; I'll always do it, but
I'll do it in moderation and do
something worthwhile - like
write or kiss or sing or run -
while I'm putting off the inevi
table. And I won't beat myself
up about it, at least until the
next sleepless night.

Perhaps someone's com
piled the statistics on procras
tination as well.

lege Socialists met on Monday
night to debate the issues. As
expected, there was little dif
ference in the rhetonc of the
Democrats and the Socialists,
and the only voice regarding
change after the Clinton-Gore
disaster was fiom the College
Republicans.
Throughout the evening,
the Democrats showed their
true colors. When asked to de
scribe the differences between
the platforms of their party and
that of the socialists, they were
hard pressed to come up with
an answer. The most revealing
part of the response was the
statement that capitalism was
good "for now," clearly show
ing a socialist leaning.

A reply to a question con
cerning school choice had one
Democratic panelist saying that
people have school choice; if
they don't like their school,
they can pick up and move.
Not since Nelson Rockefeller's
statement on the average
American's wages has a state
ment so blind to the realities of
the lower and middle classes
been uttered.
If that was not enough,
the Democrats, again along
with the Socialists, endorsed
the idea of a global govern¬

ment. This is yet another ex
ample of liberal disregard of
the Constitution.
The Republicans offered
a much different vision for
America. They supported p ut
ting parents in charge of school
choice through vouchers and
other programs. Abortion, as
always, was a hot topic, and the
Republicans defended the right
to life as the basis of all our God
given rights. "It is life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness in
that order" as it was so elo
quently stated.

The issues of foreign and
defense policies also dominated
the night. The conservative
Republicans supported a foi
eign policy based on the best
interests of the United States
and the defense of American
sovereignty.
Again, the Democrats
and the Socialists were in agree
ment on a foreign policy that
ieduces the United States to a
pawn of the UN. Finally, as
always, Republicans showed
their traditional support of
smaller government, lower
taxes, and decreased and more
responsible spending.
One interesting part of
the debate was the diversity of
the opinions within the parties.
The Socialists had no diversity
at all, but that is to be expected
of an ideology that spawned
the Soviet Union and the
People'sRepubhc of China.

On the Democratic side,
there was one dissenting opin
ion given on school choice, but
she was quickly quieted. This
is not surprising of a party that
did not let Pennsylvania Gov
ernor Bob Casey (D) speak at
their 1992 National Conven
tion because if his Pro-Life
stance on abortion.
However, on the Repub
lican side, one panelist differed
from the party line on many
social issues from abortion to
homosexuals in the military. In
fact, it was these differences
that played a role in his being
on the panel, to show the "big
tent" nature of the Republican
Party. But this is to be expected
of a party that (gasp) supports
the First Amendment and the
Constitution.

All in all, the College Re
publicans clearly won the de
bate. They were the most pre
pared, most responsive, and
most informed of all the par
ties. They also had the correct
vision for America, the one
based on smaller government,
personal responsibility, and tra
ditional American values.

Lady Bullets achieve 49th straight win as men suffer disappointing loss to F&M

by Mom Ciark
S'lAW- WUIIER
Tins past weekend the
Gettysburg swim teams faced
the Franklin & Marshall Dip
lomats. The women won bv a
score of 140-65, while the men
lost by a score ot 116-89. The
win was the 49th consecutive
win for the women's team and
also gave the women the right
to claim the Centennial Con
ference title once more.
Unfortunately, the men
were not as fortunate. It was

the first time that they have lost
the Confeience in seven years.
The Diplomats came into the
meet ready tor a win and they
achieved their goal.
Commen11ng on the
weekend, senior Abby Mueller
said, "After all that the seniois
have been through together
over the past four years, it was
disappointing that the boys
could not share in our triumph.
However I am confident that
they will be successful at
Conference's and can celebrate
with us one last time."
Junior David Lavigne was
credited with the men's first

win ot the meet in the 5 0
fieestyle. The men made a
comeback in the last event ot
the meet, the 400 freestyle re
lay, pulling in a first and sec
ond place finish.
However, by this time,
the damage had already been
done. Senior Jamey Gallagher
commented, "We're just disap
pointed about the loss."

had double wins in the 1000
and 500 freestyle. Senior cap

double winner in the 50 and
100-yard freestyles.
One of the other major
standouts of the meet was nevv
comer to the team Saiah
Steverman. Sarah swam the
200 buttertlv, placing fust in a
lifetime-best swim in the event
Saturday's meet was the
last time that some of the se-

niois will ever swim m the Get
tysburg CUB pool.
The men's and women's
swim reams will compete e\t the
Centennial Conference Cham
pionships in Franklin &C
Marshall in less than two
weeks. They have been train
ing rigorously for this final
meet since late August. All of
their haid work has to be
shown in one single weekend.
Freshman Heather
Gallaghei commented on the
season's culmination. "I think

we finished up the season very
strong and we are definitely
ready foi our conference meet
in two weeks," she said.
Those who qualified for
Division III Nationals will prac
tice for the next three weeks
until they head down to At
lanta, Georgia to compete at
Emory University.
Right now it is uncertain
which Bullets will compete m
the National Championships.
The swimmeis are anxiously
awaiting the completion of all
Division III meets in the United
States so they may learn then
fate. Seveial swimmeis have
already made the first "B" cut.
Brieanne Pulhs qualified in the
1000 tieestyle, putting her in
1 lth place nationwide in Divi
sion III.

Missy West is also a quali
fier in the 200 breaststroke
putting her in 12th place na

Bullets Track looking strong all-around

by Lauren Davis
Staff Writer
Throws, jumps, sprints,
distances, relays...you name it,
the Gettysburg track team has
it. Both the women's and
men's teams showed their
depth at the Franklin &
Marshall Invitational on Satur
day as the women captured
third place among 17 teams
and the men placed 6th out of
20. Anne Schenck, Jon
Catlett, and Lauren Davis all
established school records for
the Bullets, as did both the men
and women's 4x200 teams, and
a number of other individuals
turned in excellent perfor
mances throughout the day.
The women began the
meet in the field, as Schenck

sparked the Bullets' scoring by
picking up 13 points in the high
and long jumps. Her first-place
leap of 17*8" in the long jump
far outdistanced the competi
tion, and her previous school
record in the event. Mean
while, classmate Cathy
Spangler put the shot 34' 1 1/
4" to take fifth place.
The Bullets hit the track
later in the afternoon and did
not disappoint. The women's
4x200 team of juniors Ken
Hymen and Courtney Hurd,
freshman Joanna Silver, and
senior captain Andi Them
broke their week-old school
record to take second place in
1:51.71.
Hymen later broke the
tape in the open 400 meter
dash with a winning time of
1:03.45. _„
Davis contributed to the

Bullets' cause in the 800 meters
with a 2nd place in 2:25.1, the
Lady Bullets' third school
record of the day. She also
picked up a third place in the
1500 with a time of 5:03.2.
By the end of the day, the
women had collected 52 points
to finish behind West Virginia
Wesleyan and Dickinson and
establish a convincing gap over
Centennial Conference rivals
Western Maryland and
Haverford, who finished 4th
and 5th.
The men got off to a
strong start in the field as well.
Senior Mike Wilhams's 45' 1 3/
4" throw in the shot put was
good for first place, while
sophomore Chris Russo
jumped 6' 0" to capture 4th
place in the high jump.

Once on the track, the
Bullets continued to shine, be¬

ginning the day by setting a
school record in the 4x200.
Freshman Phil Ferraro joined
juniors Jeff Cumpson, J.T.
Farrell, and Nick LaPorta on
the third-place team that ran
1:35.41.
Individually, LaPorta fin
ished 3rd in the open 200 in
23.67, while Farrell raced to
4th place in the 400 in 52.84.
Catlett, a junior, capped
the Bullets' scoring with the fi
nal school record of the day,
taking 5th place in the 3000 in
9:01.2 to eclipse the 1996
mark established by Bill Gray.
The men's 32 points put
them in 6th place behind
Dickinson, Johns Hopkins, and
Haverford, but ahead of several
other conference teams.
The Bullets look to im
prove on their standing in the
next few weeks.

Head Coach Bob
Condon is happy with his
team's progression. "We look
as though we are improving
weekly and our depth people
are getting stronger," he said.
The Bullets have clearly
found strength in their num
bers, and this young team is
improving every week.
The Silver Spikes for the
meet were awarded to senior
first-place finishers Williams
and Schenck.
Them noted that
Schenck's leap in the long jump
just missed the NCAA Division
III Championship provisional
qualifying mark, but Schenck
still has a chance to qualify for
the meet as the Bullets take this
weekend off, before heading to
the Kutztown Invitational next
weekend and the conference
meet at the end of February

Bullets still in hunt after triumph over Haverford

by Erik Bullwinkel
Staff Writer
During this past week,
the Bullets faced a down-but
not-out scenario. This season,
the Gettysburg men's basket
ball team has dealt with some
tough losses, yet they have re
turned in resilient form in the
following games.
This remains the case.
Last week, the Bullets pulled
out a thrilling win at home
over Dickinson, to find them
selves in the middle of the race
for a playoff spot in the Cen¬

tennial Conference. One week
later, the Bullets faced perhaps
their toughest road test this
season.
Defending Centennial
Conference champion Johns
Hopkins had already handed
the Bullets a loss this season at
Bream Gym. Rolling on the
steam of two big wins versus
Dickinson and Swarthmore,
the Bullets traveled to Balti
more seeking a very important
win, which would build the
Bullets' momentum and avenge
their previous loss to the Blue
Jays this season.

The Bullets played strong
in the first half and held a 32
30 lead at halftime. In the sec
ond half the Bullets fought
hard, but fell short.
With the score tied at 42,
the Blue Jays went on a 7-0 run
to take a 49-42 lead with 11:40
remaining in the game. A turn¬

around jumper from junior
Greg Schreiber with 7:04 left
to play brought the Bullets to
within two points, 55-53. That
was as close as the team would
get, as the Blue Jays went on to
post a 70-62 win.
Senior co-captain Bill
Davidson led Gettysburg scor
ers with 14 points. Junior
Mike Monroe posted a season
high 13 points.
After the setback, the
men returned home on Satur
day to match up with the
Haverford Fords. The defeated
the Fords 70-63. The Bullets,
still in the midst of playoff con
tention, were eager to get back
on the winning track. The
Fords held a 3-16 record going
into the contest, which made
the prospect of a win promis
ing.

Davidson remarked on
the Bullets ability to regroup,
stating, "You just need to for
get about the loss and focus on
the next game. We're still in
the playoff hunt if we win out.
I said before the Haverford
game that this was game one
of a five game winning streak
to end the year."
The Bullets stormed out
to an early 13-2 lead, keyed by
senior Ryan Napp who had two
three pointers. Haverford
battled back to contend with
the Bullets, however. After sev
eral lead changes, the men went
into the locker room at half
time with a 34-28 lead.
In the second half, the
Bullets made a number of ef¬

forts to extend their lead.
Each Bullet run drew a re
sponse from the pesky Fords.
The Fords took their final
lead of the game 56-54 with
4:41 left to play.
Then on the next pos
session for Gettysburg,
Davidson hit his second of
back-to-back three pointers
to put the team ahead 57-56.
Gettysburg never trailed
again. The Bullets put forth a
well balanced scoring attack
against the Fords. Davidson
led the Bullet scorers with 15
points, all of which came in
the second half, while Napp
posted 14. Sophomores Jim
Natale and Curtis McNeil
also reached double figures,
scoring 11 and 10 points, re
spectively. Natale's 11 points
were a career high.

Gettysburg also re
ceived good play off the
bench. The Bullets got 22
points from their reserves, led
by guards Natale and
Terrence Callahan.
There are foui regulai
season games remaining foi
the men's basketball team
with a playoff spot on the
line. The Bullets are two
games behind division leader
Franklin and Marshall and
one game behind both
Dickinson and Johns
Hopkins. Key contests re
maining on the schedule for
the Bullets are road games at
F&M, February 9, and
Dickinson, February 19.

Bullets secure first dual meet title prior to
Centennial Conference Championships

by Richard Lukas
Staff Writer
This past Saturday, the
Gettysburg College Wrestling
team traveled to Indiantown
Gap for a quad-meet, facing off
against Lebanon Valley,
Ursinus, and Delaware Valley.
The Bullets ended 2-1 on
day, with wins over Ursinus
and Lebanon Valley. The 22
12 Gettysburg victory over
Ursinus marked the highest

ment of the day.
Freshman Steve Kareha
(133) posted a 4-1 decision
over senior Kevin Greco, while
sophomore Tim Scarpato (157)
defeated Jim Turner 10-4.
Despite a dominating
performance by Matt Helwig
(who eventually won by an in
jury default), the Bullets re
mained tied 12-12 going into
the last three matches.
Led by the success of se
nior prima donna Morgan

Douglas (184), who defeated
Travis Allied 10-3, the heavy

ing Ursinus no chance of a
comeback.
Freshman Btandon
Smith (197) posted a pivotal
9-1 major decision over Mark
Rodkey, and Shawn Greene's
(Hwt) 7-5 win over Lou
DiStefano capped an excel
lent team performance.
Delaware Valley won
the next match against Get
tysburg 50-0, but the Bullets

were not disheaitened.
The team came back to
post a 46-9 victoiy ovei Lebanon
Valley, in which senioi captain
_Chus Beck (174) collected his
tenth pin of the season, pinning
Josh Rhoads in 37 seconds.
One teammate remarked
that the match was to be dedi
cated to "the memory of Con
crete Pete's gimpy shoulder."
With the win over Ursinus,
Gettysburg (9-15-1, 5-1 CC)
vaulted into a first place tie with
Western Maryland (11-2, 5-1

CC). This is the first time that
the Bullets have secured a dual
meet title going into the Cen
tennial Conference champion
ships. This Saturday the Bullets
head off to face the University
of Scranton, an out-of-confer

friendly nature of the meet, no
team will be looking to roll
over. The Centennial Confer

uled for Saturday, February 19
at Johns Hopkins University.
