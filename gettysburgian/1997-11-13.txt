College drafts new
sexual assault policy

by Daniel Larkin
News Editor

Over the past few weeks, the College has proposed a
revision to the current policy concerning sexual assault.
These proposed changes resulted from a campus-wide
"Day of Dialogue" held in the spring of 1996 to discuss con
cerns about sexual assault on campus.
There had been increasing incidents of sexual assault
on campus and students were particularly concerned about a
number of issues. These included campus policies regarding
sexual assault, communication and support issues, and the need
for increased educational programs.
These discussions resulted in a number of new programs.
An anonymous report form was developed to make the re
porting of incidents more likely. A rape defense for women
was initiated. And passive educational efforts, such as the
Red Zone Posters, were increased significantly.
But the most import change was the revision of the ex
isting Sexual Assault Policy.
The current policy, as written in the Student Handbook
states "Sexual assault is defined as threats of or deliberate
physical contact of, a sexual nature which is against another
person's will or consent."
The proposed draft of the new policy, called the "Posi
tive Consent Policy," makes a number of significant changes
to the existing rules. The proposal was drafted by a commit
tee that included students Travis Kreider, Chris Killam,
Carolyn Holmes, and Kim Tracy.
Perhaps the most important change proposed to the
policy is the provision that "Verbal Consent must be clear and
affirmative."
This change would eliminate the idea that consent is
implied unless "No" is clearly stated. Positive consent re
quires a "Yes", or other affirmative statement.
According to Dean of the College Julie Ramsey, inci
dents of sexual assault are "often the result of miscommuni
cation between men and women."
Dean Ramsey feels that the proposed policy will elimi
nate many of the ambiguities that exist in the present system,
and help to create an environment of "consensual, responsible
intimacy."

Security to merge with College Life

by Henry Fawell
Staff Writer For the past several
months, Gettysburg College
has considered moving the
Safety and Security office from
its present branch of operation
the Finance and Administra
tion office, to a new, more rea
sonable branch, namely the
College Life Division.
The college felt that,
since the majority of the issues
faced by Safety and Security
deal with the welfare of stu
dents, integrating the office
into the Administration of Col
lege Life would make better
sense. In the past, Gettysburg's

I want my GCTV!

Student group
by Laura Root
Staff Writer , _
After years of inactivity,
the Gettysburg College Televi
sion (GCTV) station is being
launched back into action.
A committee led by stu
dents Matt Bange, Mike Wooden,
Jen Misluk, and Jason Bresky has
taken on the task of installing a
cable television station network,
with hopes of putting shows on
the air by the beginning of the
spring semester.
The group began working
on its idea last September. They
started by investigating the past
history of a television station at
Gettysburg College.

Their detective work re
vealed that the College does have
a cable television installation
available on Channels Four and
Five, although it is currently in
active. They also uncovered a

relaunches College television station

small amount of equipment, in
cluding an editor, television cam
eras, and cable lines.
The minimal equipment
only causes one hindrance in the
station's growth - programs will
not be able to be seen at any place
not located on the gettysburg
College campus. This includes
Paxton and Criterion Halls, Lamp
Post, fraternity houses, and apart
ments.
The problem does have the
potential to be quickly remedied
, though. Student support of
GCTV can raise money so that
its creators will be able to buy
more equipment.
Currently, six students and
five faculty members head the
GCTV Revival Committee. The
Committee held its first meeting
last Monday, and 45 interested
students attended.

Concerned students have a
chance to run for positions on the

Executive Board of GCTV. The
Executive Board is comprised of
a Station Director who directs the
Executive Committee and keeps
track of the budget; a General
Electrician who gives mainte
nance to the equipment, pur
chases the equipment, and trains
new members of the board; a Pro
duction Manager in charge of
keeping track of the comings and
goings of the equipment; a Train
ing Director who trains new
GCTV members; a Review Com
mittee Director who is respon
sible for the coordination of the
different teams of GCTV; a Pro
duction Coordinator in charge of
the television station's schedule;
and a Public Relations Director
who is responsible for the
station's relationship with all
other campus organizations.

GCTV will begin opera
tions by organizing its members
into teams. Each team will un¬

dergo training and produce its
own program.
The programs do not have
to follow a specific subject - the
station isopen to any idea. Pos
sibilities include news shows,
professors' lectures, and sports
events. The output will be en
tirely student based.
"The best part about GCTV
is the creativity and freedom that
it allows," says Matt Bange, one
of the leaders of this new project.
GCTV plans to show its
first installment of programming
by the beginning of the spring
semester. The shows will be aired
between 7:00 p.m. and 10:00
p.m., which is considered to be
prime viewing time for students.
GCTV will hold its next
meeting on Monday, November
17 at 9:00 p.m. in CUB 260. Any
interested students are welcome
to attend.

Safety and Security office has
worked closely with several dif
ferent branches within the Col
lege, particularly College Life,
despite its affiliation with Fi
nance and Administration.
Therefore, beginning June
1, 1998, the Safety and Security
office will begin operation under
the Dean of the College. Mike
Webster, who previously super
vised a similar transition at West
ern Maryland College, has been
hired by Gettysburg to help en
sure that Safety and Security's
transition between the two offices
runs smoothly.
Jennie Mingolelli, Vice
President for Finance and Admin
istration feels that, "Through this
restructuring, the staffs of Secu
rity, Residential Life, Facilities
Services and Risk Management
will be able to achieve a more in
tegrated approach to providing a
safe campus environment."

Timon Linn,-the former
supervisor of the Safety and Se¬

curity office, will stay on at
Gettysburg College, but in a new
position.
Beginning January first,
Linn will assume the duties of the
Director of Environmental Safety
Services, which oversees envi
ronmental safety, fire safety pro
cedures and a number of other is
sues. The College hopes to find
a new Director of Safety and Se
curity Services by the January
first transition date.
Gettysburg College has
also emphasized that no layoffs
will be made during the transi
tion period, nor will the College
alter any of the procedures pres
ently used by the office of Safety
and Security.
If the transition proceeds as
envisioned, Mingolelli believes,
"this realignment of responsibili
ties will provide a more robust
institutional safety program." 1

The proposed drarf
also states that "Verbal Con
sent is an ongoing process.
If the amount or kind of
sexual intimacy changes dur
ing an interaction (i.e., if two
people move from kissing
while fully clothed, which is
one level, to undressing for
direct physical contact,
which is another level), the
people involved need to ex
press their clear and verbal
consent before moving on to
the new level."
The draft also aims to
clear up the ambiguities in
the policy concerning alco
hol and drugs. It states "If
you have sex with someone
who is intoxicated or
drugged, even if they stated
yes, you may still be charged
with sexual misconduct."

The proposed policy
has been brought forward for
debate and discussion to
many student groups includ
ing Student Senate, several

residence halls, and each
Sorority and Fraternity.
According to
Ramsey, student reaction to
the policy has been mixed.
Some students have wel
comed the proposed
changes, while others have
been "skeptical and defen
sive," she said.
Dean Ramsey called
the proposed policy "pretty
progressive." Most colleges
have policies comparable
with Gettysburg's current
policy, though some
schools, including
Georgetown and Antioch
have implemented simi
larly progressive policies.
The policy will likely
undergo many revisions
before it is finally imple
mented. Ramsey stated
that she believed any
changes that will be made
will not become policy un
til the Fall of 1998.

The ABC's of GHB

by Cara Masucci
Staff Writer For the past couple of
years, a lot of publicity has been
given to date rape drugs. Most
of the attention has gone to
Rohypnol, commonly known
as roofies. Not much press has
been given to another date rape
drug: Gamma-Hydroxybu
tyrate, or GHB.
Only recently has GHB
has come to the public's atten
tion. Both Rohypnol and GHB
are sedatives increasingly being
used as date rape drugs. They
both act as an anti-depressant
in the body. The rapid rise in
cases of date rape by the use of
GHB has fueled much attention
to the drug lately. It is to the

point where even Oprah did a
show about it a few weeks ago.
GHB is a white, odorless
pill that dissolves quickly into
drinks. It's also known as Liq
uid E, Gamma-OH, and Easy
Lay. It has much the same ef
fect on the body as roofies.
When ingested, it is known to
cause sleepiness and vulnerabil
ity. It has even been dubbed
"liquid ecstasy." It's highly con
centrated street form is avail
able, as a liquid, in small plas
tic bottles about the size and
shape of a hotel shampoo
bottle. One dosage is usually a
capful. There are approxi
mately 9 hits per bottle, and at
$10 a bottle, not only is this
drug potent, but it's very cheap,

too. It has many of the same
effects upon the body as alco
hol. It lowers inhibitions, im
pairs motor skills and thought
processes. It is considered
worse to drive when using
GHB than after drinking.
If ingested in too high a
dosage, it has the same effects
as alcohol on the body. Spe
cific examples are blackouts,
amnesia, and difficulty speak
ing. Originally used as an an¬

esthetic, it is usually sold in
small tablets.
Like roofies, it turns col
orless, odorless, and is salty
tasting when mixed with a liq
uid. Part of the reason it is so
dangerous is because you can
not see or smell it in the drink.

No hal
lucinations occur that
would sug
gest some
thing is
wrong, and
the effects of
the drugs can
take effect in
twenty to
thirty min
utes. The ef
fects can last
up to four

hours after
the initial
dosage.
On its
own, GHB
can be dan
gerous, but
when mixed
with alcohol,
the effects are
doubled.
Since both
are sedatives,
mixed to
gether they
can lead to

unconscious
ness, comas,
and in the
worst cases,
death. A few
weekends

A slip of the wrist is all it takes to drug an unsuspecting victim.

ago on the campus of Syracuse
University, what appears to be
a GHB related rape occurred.
Allegedly the girl in
volved woke up several hours
after a party to find herself
wrapped in plastic outside of
a dorm without any knowl
edge of what had happened to
her. Unfortunately, GHB
completely breaks down in a

few hours. After that there is no
trace to be found in the body.
Trying to prove a case without
this crucial evidence is almost
impossible.
This happens frequently
with GHB due to the blackouts
and coma-like state it induces.

Victims might be unable
to identify the events surround
ing the rape. Is it also difficult
to know how to stop the drug
from taking effect, since it acts
so quickly.
This widespread use of
date rape drugs, and more spe
cifically, GHB, has led legisla
tors to introduce several bills
that would impact the status of
GHB.

Many states have moved
to criminalize GHB, as Florida,
Georgia, and Rhode Island
have already done. In these
states the manufacturing or
selling of GHB is punishable by
a fifteen-year sentence and a
twenty thousand dollar fine.

Presi
d e n t
Clinton signed a
measure in
1996 called
the "Drug
Induced Rape Pre
vention and
Punishment Act of
19 9 6."
This act im
poses a

prison sen
tence of up
to twenty
years for
distribution of this drug
to anyone
without his
or her con
sent and
knowledge
in order to
commit sexual as
sault.

U n -
fortunately,
it is very dif
ficult to
completely
rid the
country of
this drug

because information on it and
how it is made are readily and
easily available. There are even
ingredients and recipes avail
able on the Internet.
Many people also push to
keep GHB in the country be
cause it does have some ben
eficial qualities. It is useful to
certain extents in psycho
therapy, muscle development
and an anesthesia.

Though this drug may be
safe under strict supervision, it
has such an exact dosage that
it is dangerous anywhere else.
This is why the drug has never
been legal for use within the
United States.
The FDA has put out sev
eral warnings about GHB in the
last few years. They tell of how
GHB can be linked to a blood
disorder, and how the drug has
not been approved.
Nothing seems to allevi
ate the problem, because it can
still be bought in catalogues,
body building gyms, and even
health food stores.
Lawmakers have tried
successfully in many situations
to categorize GHB in the same
ways as alcohol. Under the in
fluence of GHB, both sex and/
or sexual contact is illegal.

The premise behind this
is that under the influence of
both alcohol and GHB, the per
son is impaired mentally as well
as physically. In a comatose
state, the victim has no defense
whatsoever.
These facts can seem very
scary. To think that someone,
at any given time, could slip
something into your system
that would make you com
pletely defenseless, is terrifying.
Fortunately, there is good
advice about dealing with these
drugs. Investigators of date
rapes committed with the use
of GHB or roofies say that the
best defense a person has
against being a victim is them
selves.
Trust your own instinct,
and if something seems to be
going wrong, it probably is. In
tough situations, call on a
friend or make as much of a

scene as possible. Never leave
a drink unattended, and do not
accept drinks from people you
do not trust completely.
The chances of being
raped with the use of drugs are
minimized if one uses their own
intuition and common sense.

Olmos delivers in a lifetime of work

by Jon _Froehlich
Staff Writer
Born on February 21.
1946, Edward James Olmos,
this year's Fall Convocation
speaker, has become one of
America's most influential His
panic actors.
Though Olmos made his
entrance into the public domain
through his starnng role as
Lieutenant Maitin Castillo on
the hit TV cop show Miami
Vice, there were many other
important projects both before
and after this that made Olmos
the person and actor that he is
today. Growing up in Boyle
Heights, a Hispanic neighbor
hood in East Los Angeles,
Olmos experienced a pro
nounced Mexican heritage of
many generations. As one can
see from many of Olmos' roles,
his strong ethnic background
stuck with him throughout the
years.

At the age of 13, Olmos
became convinced, through su
per-stars like James Brown and
Little Richard, that he was des-

For rules, see the off campus bulletin board
at the Student Union or call for information

tined for a career involving
singing and dancing. Unlike
many teens with similar aspi
rations to dedicate themselves
to the performing aits, Olmos'
dream became a reality in 1968
when his band, Eddie and the
Pacific Ocean, became the
house band at private Sunset
Drive club, The Factory.
Somehow knowing that
the success of his band would
not get him where he wanted
to go, Olmos began attending
classes at California State Uni
versity during the day and still
performed with his band at
night. Though at first inter
ested in the social sciences,
Olmos eventually moved to
wards what seemed his destiny
- theater and dance.

Tiding himself over un
til his inevitable big break,
Olmos, while also delivering
antique furniture on the side,
picked up small roles in shows
like Hawaii Five-0 and Kojak.
After another token part in the
1975 movie aloha, bobby and
rose, Olmos got the chance to
play what was to be a life-

changing role.
At age 31, Olmos was of
fered a role in the street play
Zoot Suit. Opening in 1978 to
last only ten days, Zoot Suit
went on to have a run that
lasted over a year and a hall
until finally ending with a short
stint on Broadway. Proclaimed
by Olmos to be "the first real

A-

play about Latinos," Zoot
Suit earned a Tony nomination.
Olmos' life took another
interesting turn when he was
offered the role of a Native
American high steel worker in
the movie Wolfen. Though he
at first turned the part down,
insisting that the director cast
a true Native American, he
eventually took it after getting
official permission from The
American Indian Movement
(AIM). This act not only
earned Olmos an AIM humani
tarian award, but it points out

Olmos's extreme concern for
the preservation on ethnic and
national identity that he applies
to his own heritage and cultural
life. Much of the next few
years of Olmos's life were
taken up by Robert Young's
1983 movie, The Ballad of
Gregario >Cortez - a true story
of a Mexican farm hand falsely
accused of murder in Texas.
Through massive promo
tion of this film, Olmos not
only helped to be sure that this
story was told properly, but he

also did much to heighten His
panic pride throughout the
United States.
The next big project for
Olmos came with Miami Vice.
Also starring the smooth- talk
ing Don Johnson. This, one of
Olmos's most famous roles, ran
for five years and earned him
an Emmy and a Golden Globe
for Best Sup¬

porting Actor
in a Continu
ing Drama
Scries. Mi
._^ a in i

also offered Olmos his direc
torial debut with what is often
considered the very best epi
sode of the whole series -
Bushido.
Olmos would go on to
direct other films after this TV
episode, such as the story of a
Hispanic family, American Me,
in 1992.
Perhaps one of Olmos's
most loved and important roles
was his portrayal of Bolivian
born math teacher in the 1988
film:

Stand and Deliver
"You already have two
strikes against you. There are
some people in this world who
will assume you know less than
you do because of your name
and your complexion. But
math is the great equalizer." -
Jamie Escalante
From the first scene of
Stand and Deliver, Olmos's se
riousness and dedication to
both acting and teaching are
apparent. The movie hit audi
ences hard and fast with a pic¬

ture of Hispanic pride that has
been, and continues to be, a
strong theme in Olmos's life.
Olmos offers a genuine
and enthusiastic performance
in the role of math teacher
Jamie Escalante. In the same
genre as such movies as Dan
gerous Minds and Lean on Me ,
Escalante enters a new job in
the under-funded and disre
spected Garfield High School.
Set in East L.A., both the
school and neighborhood in
Stand and Deliver are similar to
those that Olmos faced grow
ing up.
As he is ready to break all
the rules, Escalante takes it as
his personal mission to take his
basic math class far beyond
what is expected of them by
preparing them to pass the Ad
vanced Placement Calculus
test.

In the process, he not
only teaches his students math,
but also the ethnic and personal
pride that he knows they will
need to succeed.
The movie takes on real
meaning when Escalante him
self is faced with failure - as his
students, after many dedicated
hours of summer school, have
all passed the AP test, but are
accused of cheating.
But when the students
have enough confidence to re
take the test, it is clear that
Escalante has actually suc
ceeded.
However, Stand and De
liver focuses its attention on the
students as well as the teacher.
With one of the biggest
names being Lou Diamond
Phillips, who starred in La
Bamba (another movie con
cerned with Hispanic life),
Stand and Deliver probes the
lives of Escalante's students
who face obstacles at home as
well as at school.

This latest movie from
director Ramon Menendez
(Money for Nothing) contains
excellent performances by both
Olmos and Phillips and offers
a serious but fun story which
communicates an up-lifting
message.

Cheerio. London: Hello. Essex

by Mark Berg
England Correspondent
The study abroad pro
gram in England began in late
August with a seminar called
"Mad Women, Fallen Women,
New Women, and Other
Women: 19th Century British
Women," taught by Professor
Temma Berg.
Appropriately, the fifteen
students lived in the George
Hotel in Cartwright Gardens,
a crescent of Georgian build
ings near Russell Square in
Bloomsbury.
Bloomsbury is in a (rela
tively) quiet section of London.
The hotel is two blocks from
the tube and several bus lines,
close to the Euston and King's
Cross train stations, one long
block from a Safeway super
market and gourmet mini
mart, near fish and chips res
taurants and several pubs, and
around the corner from that

most essential establishment, a
laundromat.
And then the program

moved to the University of
Essex.
The University of Essex is
in Wivenhoe Park, near
Colchester, an hour's train ride
from London, but worlds
apart. Wivenhoe proper is a
small village on the River
Colne, with a small port, a train
station, and (what else?) several
pubs. The pub is the neighbor
hood social center, where you
can nurse a pint of ale until
closing time. I think one of the
reasons there are so many pubs
is the strict law against drunk
driving in Britain; there's al
ways a pub within walking dis
tance. Colchester, the oldest re
corded city in England and
once the largest civilian city of
Roman England, has a popula
tion of less than 100,000, but
has lots and lots of shops, and
many pubs.

At the University, each of
the Gettysburg students took
four courses of his or her

choice, while Professor Berg
taught a class called "Roman
tics to Moderns" in the Depart
ment of Literature. Even I'm
sitting in on two history
courses.
The approach to teaching
here is very different from the
American approach. Most
courses consist of a lecture once
a week, followed by separate
classes, which may or may not
take place immediately after
the lecture.
The lecture is exactly
that: a monologue by the pro
fessor, who rarely asks or takes
questions from the students. In
my history courses, each class
contains about half of the stu
dents and is interactive, with
the professor stimulating the
discussion by asking questions
related to the lecture.

The University of Essex
was built in the 1960's, a time
when the British university sys
tem expanded considerably. It
is small for a university here,
with 5,550 students, a large

number of which come from
about 110 other countries; you
can walk around campus and
not hear a word of English.
That's not entirely accu
rate; it's just that you can't un
derstand even the British stu
dents sometimes. Example: in
Professor Berg's class, a student
said that a poem was
"pahstrool." After further dis
cussion, she realized he had
said "pastoral."
The campus is on 200
pahstrool acres. The academic

buildings, however, do not live
up to the setting. It was a bold
design: 5 open courts created
by linked buildings descending
down a slope.
But it's too much con
crete (no bricks at all), much
too cold. And, because the
buildings are interconnected,
the room numbering scheme is,
well, let's just say I wonder
what they were smoking when
they came up with it. For ex
ample, one of my history lec
tures is in 5N3.7, and the class

that follows is in 2.403. You
can walk from one to the other
without going outside; I just
follow the professor.
On the sides of the courts
are a post office (which also
handles dry cleaning and film
processing), a student travel
agency, banks, and "the largest
Students' Union Bar in East
Anglia" (legal drinking age
18). The residences, north and
south of the academic build
ings, consist of six 14 or 15
story towers and a number of
2 or 3 story dormitories.
There is also a mini-mart
on one of the courts, but for
real food shopping, it's Tesco,
sort of like a huge Weis/Giant.
It is, however, about a mile
away, by walking or by bus,
depending on how much you
have to buy and the weather.

And because Wivenhoe
and Colchester themselves are
about 2-3 miles away in oppo
site directions, we've all be
come acquainted with bus
schedules.

Time to call the Orkin man

by Jon Froehlich
Staff Writer
To put it simply, Starship
Troopers is an entertaining
movie.
I know what you're
thinking and, to answer you,
yes, Starship Troopers is the
movie about the over-sized
bugs at war with a futuristic
human race. But you'll notice
'
this movie as "good." The truth
, , talking
about movies, we use the words

"good" and "entertaining" in
terchangeably. But, there is a
profound and important differ
ence. Much of the time, for a
film to be considered "good"
by those who make it their busi
ness to review movies, it has to
be The Piano or The English
Patient. Starship Troopers is
neither of these. It is not artis
tic, it isn't terribly insightful
and it is definitely not going to
be up for Best Picture this year.
But, it is undeniably "entertain-

Beginning and ending
with a surprisingly creative
farce of an armed services re¬

cruiting commercial that one
might see on futuristic Monday
Night Football (which with any
luck will still be around by the
time big bugs begin taking
over), Starship Troop- ^^^^
ers plays it smart by _HJU
not taking itself too I
seriously. From the I
very beginning, audi- I
ences will most likely I
Starship
Troopers is really a I
.
This is not to I
say that it utilizes I
slapstick comedy as I a
in movies like The I m
Naked Gun, but it I I
does have a subtle I I
humor to it. By mak- I _^^
ing viewers laugh at _^^^H
the pure absurdity of _^^^H
many of the situa- _^^^M
tions, it makes it easy
for us to just sit back and enjoy
the movie for what is - and not
what it isn't.

The fact is, when taken at
face value, Starship Troopers is
a pretty good movie.
The plot is fairly simple
and, if you think about it too
much, you will most likely

question why you spent your
money to see this. So my ad
vice is, don't think - just watch.
Basically, a new race of
large arachnids is taking over
the uni¬

verse and threat
ening human life as we know.
Though an alien species
threatening Earth is by no
means a novel concept, direc
tor Paul Verhoven (Showgirls,
Robocop) does a pretty good
job making it seem almost revo
lutionary.

Using special effects that
will make audiences feel that
they've stumbled into a two
hour Epcot Center exhibit,
Starship Troopers seems a fresh
and fun movie that recog¬

nizes that what it proposes
to viewers is, like many sci
ence fiction movies, not
even close to conceivable.
We are presented
i*\ with Johnny Rico as

_^^^^_B there was a

IVn "«""" _;
|H L_^_l slightly less
whiny ver¬

sion of Luke Skywalker,
all we really get is a Baywatch
lifeguard with a military uni
form slapped on him.
Nevertheless, audiences
will more than likely find Rico
to be, though a little cheesy, an
amiable star for this movie.

Through Rico and co-star Neil
Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser
M.D.), Starship Troopers takes
a quick look at many of the di
lemmas faced by a young man
during war time.
Though Van Dien is pres
ently an unknown, he will no
doubt cash in on his good looks
in the near future with the three
projects he has planned for
1998. After all, he has co
starred on Beverly Hills 90210
- he's already half way there.
Though it is easy to be
snobbish about a movie that
contains battle cries of "Bugs!
Bugs!," Starship Troopers can be
enjoyed if considered with the
right attitude.
Though in some of the
battle scenes the weightless at
mosphere doesn't seem to be an
issue and we see soldiers run
ning around unhindered by
bocce -ball sized holes in their
bodies, it is still easy to have a
good time with this movie.

If Starship Troopers is
watched with the outlook
which was meant for it, it will
no doubt be a huge crowd
pleaser.

To Casey Dunn

You were a stranger to my eyes
But I know you touched a lot of lives
I wish I had a chance to hold your hand
To be with you in your difficult times
No one knows why you took your life
I do not question, no reasons why
I pray to God for you every night
For families and friends you left behind
Wherever you may be right now
Remember you left some tears behind
Within the hearts of your friends and peers
Those that cared and loved you dearly
Take care and rest in peace.

Be Your Own Best Defense

Being responsible for
by Jay Spiese
Contributing Writer
No matter how hard I
pray, no matter how much we
want to deny it, no matter how
many times it happens before,
someone on this campus will be
raped this year. As a freshman
last year I and my classmates
learned about the previous
springs events. Knowing that
a rape had happened made
many of us sensitive for the first
month or so. Afterwards the
possibility of rape was a threat
as intangible as the ghost sto-
ries I tell. Last year at this time
i was rudely shaken to hear
from a close friend that she had
been raped at a fraternity party.
Two days later another woman
wrote anonymous emails
claiming she had also been
raped. And the tragedy went
on.

Over much of this semes
ter I have thought about how
and why this can happen on
our campus. Before sitting
d,own to write this article I con
sulted with many people from
administration on down to stu
dents. Everything I see and
hear points to one conclusion.
The education end is not lack
ing, it's the action end that is.

yourself is the best solution

<*c

8 C r Each year the Freshmen
class is bombarded with rape
education programs. CHEERS
does one during orientation
week. Wellness classes cover it
to varying degrees. Special
speakers come in and occasion
ally classes are required to at
tend their lectures. Our hall
ways bare posters warning
about the chance of rape. I can
go on citing organizations, in
dividuals, and programs which
provide the information on
rape. Clearly education is not
lacking and I must applaud

_^ na ' cr '
_^
ca that. But our weakness in this
fight is on the action side. I
have found that in every case I
know of on this campus, cer
tain characteristics are com
mon. The woman and often
the attacker as well are intoxi
cated. No one is looking out
for the victim when sKe's at a
party. The woman believe they
were unable to fight their at
tacker. I put together six abso
lute truths about rape that if
taken to heart will decrease
your chances of being raped.

1.) Rape DOES happen
here. We often live in a bubble
on campus. Occasionally we
hear that it can happen here. I

am telling you it does. I know
at least three people personally
who were raped here in the
past two years. I am sure I
know many more who were
raped but do not let it show.
Sadly, before Christmas break
I can guarantee many freshmen
will find out a friend of theirs
was raped.
2.) Rape can happen to
you. Only the attacker knows
who is being targeted. You
don't know if this guy you met
at a party can be trusted. You
don't know if he slipped some
thing in your drink. Woman

must accept that they can be
come victims. It doesn't mat
ter how popular you are or
what sorority you belong to.
You are still a potential victim.
3.) You need to keep your
wits about you to avoid becom
ing a victim. Anything that
numbs your wits and slows
your reaction is dangerous. Act
responsibly when you drink. If
you want to have a drink go
ahead, but don't drink with the
intention of getting drunk.
Also drink with responsible
friends. Even better if you go
to a party designate someone
who won't drink but will watch
out for the others. I heard from

one woman how she and some
of her friends went out to a
party. They were going to
watch out for each other. Af
ter a few minutes and a few
drinks, they became more con
cerned about their personal
enjoyment. Unfortunately for
her, no one noticed when she
was grabbed by a drunk and
pushed into a room.
4.) The best defense is a
strong offense. This is a real
ity in life and in football. This
campus offers courses in self
defense at little or no charge.

There _aje two organized mar
tial arts clubs on campus,
Cuong Nhu and Tae Kwon Do.
In the bare year that I have
taken Cuong Nhu I learned
that size and strength cannot
match skill. So do not think
you aren't big enough or strong
enough. There are always op
tions. Additionally the RAD
program is offered. RAD
teaches ways to strike vulner
able points on the male body
allowing you to escape. Which
ever you choose, I must advise
you go into it with a full com¬

mitment.
5.) You are the only per
son who can prevent a rape
There will not always be a gal

lant knight waiting for a cry of
distress. No one will come to
your aid unless you take the
first steps. Make noise. Fight
back however you can, when
ever you can, with whatever
you can. Gouge eyes, pull hair,
punch, kick, just don't give up.
The moment you stop fighting
is the moment you will be
raped. I can't describe how
appalled I am to hear that
women are being taught, "If I
fight back he will only hurt me
more."
6.) There are stronger
ways of saying no than just say
ing "no". According to some of
the people I consulted, many of
the rapes on this campus are
not intentional crimes. The
attacker is usually too drunk to
understand that a woman really
doesn't want to have sex. In a
state like this he needs a clear
unambiguous no. Remember
a swift kick to the groin says a
lot very quickly.

I hope that some people
will take this to heart, but in
reality Gettysburg is very apa
thetic. No one attempts to
remedy a problem until it is
public and serious. By then it
is too late for someone.

by Erin Patterson and Kevin
Howard Public Relations Chairs Panhel
and IFC We just want to thank
everyone who came out and
registered for rush this past
Tuesday. We hope you could
find it in your budget to cough
up the five bucks, but we prom
ise it will be very much worth
it. If for some reason you for
got about registration, don't
worry, we figured there would
have been a few of you out
there, so there will be another

rush registration sometime be
fore Thanksgiving break.
TiberFest '97 was still a
great time although indoors.
We think everyone can agree
that it was still a blast and that
Chin Ho was great. We want
to take this time to specifically
thank all of the organizations
who helped make it all happen.
We especially want to thank the
Greek organizations who were
able to support TiberFest - Al
pha Xi Delta, Alpha Tau
Omega, FIJI, Theta Chi,
Lambda Chi Alpha, Sigma Chi,
Alph Chi Rho, Phi Sigma

Kappa, Delta Gamma, Gamma
Phi Beta, Sigma Nu, IFC,
Panhel, and of course Dean
Murphy.
This past weekend Fiji
held their third annual Run for
Leukemia to aid the Leukemia
Society of Pennsylvania. Every
year Gettysburg's Fiji chapter
teams up with Dickinson's Pi
Beta Phi sorority and runs the
game ball from Dickinson to
Gettysburg to be presented at
halftime. This year, the ball
was given to Rachel Stein, a
local girl who has been diag
nosed with Leukemia. This

year's efforts were the most
successful to date, the total
amount raised was nearly
$2,900. On behalf of of both
Fiji and Pi Beta Phi, thanks to
all who participated and helped
support the cause.
If you haven't heard
about it yet, don't forget to par
ticipate in the annual jail bail
sponsorored by TKE and Delta
Gamma. Basically the idea is
to raise money amongst friends
and place a warrant out for
someone to be arrested for the
amount of money you contrib
uted. The person who has been

placed in jail, has to bail them
selves out by raising that same
amount of money. This event
is always a lot of fun and a great
fundraiser for both of these
organizations.
Congratulations to those
recently inducted into the Or
der of Omega Honor Society.

Greek organizations across the
nation. The initiates were:

From the suggestion box

We've all been there:
it's noon on Wednesday,
you just got out of your
11:00 class, and all you
want to do is eat your lunch
and relax with your
friends. To your dismay,
however, you find that
Servo is packed with
people, all seemingly want
ing the exact same food
that you want. The
crowded space allows only
crawlspeed movement,
frustrating you even more.
To top it all off, everyone
has this 'I'm the only one
in Servo' attitude, not al
lowing any courtesy or
niceties, unaware of the
people around them, even
going so far as to stop traf
fic just to talk about last
night's ventures with a
friend. This could be a
commercial for Zantac 75.

Well, Chris Johnson
and I have come up with a
plan to help alleviate some
of the problems" we all ex
perience in Servo. Some of
the problems are due solely
to the layout of the build
ing and cannot be helped,
but at least we can make
the best of what we have
to work with.
Our first goal is to
have every first-year stu
dent go through an hour
long seminar/training

course in Servo Navigation
and Customs during orien
tation. This course would
familiarize the new stu
dents with the layout of the
food distribution area,
available seating arrange
ments, and so forth. It
would also teach the stu
dents some rules in how
one is to conduct oneself,
both in the food distribu
tion area and seating areas.
Since these rules have not
yet been established, Chris
and myself would like to

share with you some of our
ideas. 1. One-way traffic
around fhat big pillar. People
going from the entree side to
the sizzler side should go be
tween the salad bar and the pil
lar, people going from sizzler
to entree should move around
the silverware side of it. This
eliminates those awkward
bumps when two people try to
go through that tiny little space.
2. An entree line that mir
rors the Sizzler line. Follow
me, here, folks. The sizzler line
goes from left to right, so that
after people get their food, they
can immediately and easily go
to the drink area. The entree
line never forms that way, so
that people who have to get
their drinks after they get their
food have to go through the
line, increasing the risk of
dropped trays and crass com
ments. It just makes more
sense.

3. No stalling at the sil
verware distribution area. Be
lieve it or not, folks, it is pos
sible to obtain your silverware
AND look at the menu at the
same time, thereby reducing
the number of standees in front
of the troublesome pillar, help
ing traffic flow. Remember,
one-way traffic around the pil
lar, so you should go to your
left as you leave the silverware
area. However, exceptions can
be made for those who find the
entree and grill choices nause
ating. 4. No talking while in the
food distribution area. This is
a big one people. I know it will
be difficult, but if people would
simply wait until they got to
their tables to discuss the press
ing national concerns of the
day, a lot less stagnant traffic
would exist.
5. Eliminate those stupid
ice machines. This may require
the help of Servo people, but
this rule or a modification

thereof may seriously aid the
traffic flow problem. Even if we
used the ice bins, and you filled
your glasses before you got to
the drink machine, more
people would be spending less
time waiting for drinks. Be
sides, the drinks are already
cold anyway. The next rule
logically follows from the pre¬

one:
6. If there's a long line at
the drink machine closest to the
desserts, DON'T GO THERE!
How many times have you
tried to get to the entree line,
only to be blocked by a myriad
of people waiting for drinks?
Try to vary the drink machines
from which you get your
drinks, so that not everybody
is at the same machine.
Obviously, there would
have to be some kind of en
forcement for the first few
weeks that the new rules go
into effect, so perhaps someone

could volunteer to be a Servo
Nazi. ("No soup for you! You
went the wrong way around
the pole!!") Or, maybe, we
could implant electronic zap
ping devices in everyone's
heads, so that when they do
something wrong, "ZAP!", you
get "punished". Getting seri
ous, though, signage can go up
indicating traffic flow around
major obstacles, not only to
remind us of the rules, but to
aid visitors and guests, who,
although we appreciate and
understand their situation, in
variably clog up the system.

Chris and I do not claim
that these rules will solve all of
the problems, so we will wel
come any editions of these rules
or suggested new rules. We
firmly believe that educating
new students about Servo pro
cedures will help in the long
run. Sincerely, Chris Johnson
and Steve Harrell

Consider this

The new sexual assault
olicy has been presented to
lany campus groups over the
ast month with mixed reac-

10ns. The Positive Consent
J olicy clarifies many ambigu
ties 1 that marred the former
_>olicy.
For example, formerly
vhen a victim came forward
vith a charge, the burden of
>rot>f fell upon the weakened
shoulders of the victim.
The policy is simple to
mplement: talk before pro
ceeding to a higher level of
iexual intimacy. On a campus
)f supposedly well-educated

>eople where discussions are
mcouragedj • communication
hould not be an issue.
How will the policy affect
he campus? In an ideal world,
his policy would discourage all
vould-be assaulters from at
empting to. take advantage of
mother person. But in reality,
he policy would not reduce the
juber of sexual assault crimes
_iccuring on campus; at best it
vould only increase the num
>er of cases reported and hope
r ully punish any one found
milty.

Will the policy cause a
;ender division? While females
n general support the policy
vithout revision, some males

take offense to points that seem
to be directed at them. In or
der for the policy to be effec
tive in any way, everyone must
undrestand and agree on the
principles its sets forth.
While the goal of the
policy is not to dictate how
people interact, it does set up
guidelines to protect both par
ties. No longer will there be
the gray area of assumed con
sent that 'causes delays in deci
sive action.
But what is the decisive
action? There is no punish
ment, or even a range of pun
ishments, outlined for offenses.
The only way for a policy
to be effective is for its creators
to definitively state the conse
quences of one's actions.

Regardless of whether
this policy is implemented or
not, it is important for the cam
pus community to understand
that, as adults, we are all called
upon to take responsibility for
our own actions.
As a whole, when pre
sented with a situation, each
individual needs to be respon
sible enough to communicate
the acceptable bounds and be
an active participant in their
own security.
In short, no policy can do
as much as exerting your own
free will.

From The Donkey's Mouth

_College students and democrats, a perfect:t

by Libby Main
Staff Writer The Democratic Party is
more responsive than the Re
publican Party to issues that
effect college students. This
fact is evident in the policies of
the current administration,
from an historical perspective,
and even on our own college
campus.
Examples of Democratic
Party policies that address the
concerns of college students
include student loan reform,
increase in environmental pro
tection, creation of volunteer
programs, and efforts to make
voter registration easier. Presi
dent Clinton challenged Con
gress to make $10,000 of col
lege tuition tax deductible each
year and to expand work study
programs and Pell grants. He
includes passage of the Student

Loan Reform Act in his list of
accomplishments. This legisla
tion allows for flexible repay
options for college loans and
the cutting of red tape in the
loan process which saves mil
lions of taxpayer dollars. Un
fortunately, the 1996 House
Republican budget plan coun
teracted Clinton's efforts by
cutting 2.5 million students
from direct student loan pro
grams, and eliminating funding
for Perkins loans and the
Americorps program.
President Clinton has
openly expressed a concern for
leaving the environment safe
and clean for the next genera
tion. He has fought Congres
sional attempts to ease EPA re
strictions on safe food, in
creased protection of national
parks, and created a new ini
tiative called the Presidential

Forest Plan. Since 1993

match
twenty-one toxic waste sites
have been cleaned up in Penn
sylvania alone compared to
only twelve in the twelve years
previous to 1993 combined.
Hum, didn't President Bush
side with logger interests and
endanger the spotted owl?
This is of interest to college stu
dents because persons between
the ages of 18-25 are three
times as likely as their parents

to consider the environment an
important political issue.
President Clinton created
the Corporation for National
Service in 1993 which allowed
200,000 students to earn
money for college by partici
pating in formal volunteer ser
vice. The motor voter bill was
also passed in 1993. This leg
islation mandated that states
include voter registration forms
in the drivers license applica
tion and renewal process which

increased the franchise of per
son 16-25 years old.
As I stated previously, the
Democratic Party has estab
lished a precedent of looking
out for the interest of college
age persons. President
Roosevelt created the Civilian
Conservation Corps and the
Tennessee Valley Authority as
a part of his New Deal to pro
vide constructive work, food
and shelter for 18-25 year old
males during the Great Depres
sion. The G.I. Bill, which gave
countless veterans the ability to
go to college courtesy of the
federal government, was a
Democratic creation. President
Kennedy was also a proponent
of young adult involvement in
politics and he established the
Peace Corps specifically for
young adults.

The specific inclusion of
young adults in the political

process is a goal of the Demo
cratic Party as a whole. The
House Democratic Leadership
Committee specifically in
cludes information for students
on their Web page. In addition,
chapters of College Democrats
are active on college campuses
across the country.
Gettysburg's own chapter is in
the process of applying for Sen
ate re-recognition and national
affiliation. In the interim they
have participated in debates,
brought speakers to campus,
and hosted a political career
planning workshop. Persons
interested in getting involved
can come to the meetings ev
ery first and third Wednesday
of the month at 6:30p.m. in the
upstairs CUB lobby in front of
the Registrars office or contact
the current Gettysburg College
Democrats President, Andy
Zysk (he can add you to the e
mail alias).

An omn letter to President Haaland

On April 21,1997 Student Senate endorsed a letter brought to them by Students
for Ethical Action, addressed to Provost DeNicola concerning the
discriminatory policy for international students who study off campus. During
the 1995-1996 academic year, Alfonso Leon approached Student Senate about
the same issue. Because changes have still not occurred to this policy, Student
Senate endorses this letter to President Haaland.
Student Senate still feels that a revision is needed to the current policy that
disallows international students, unlike other students, from transferring their
Gettysburg College financial aid to affiliated, non-major off-campus programs.
The current policy inhibits a certain group of students, based on their national
origin, from this matchless opportunity which is often encouraged to Gettysburg
College students.
As the voice of the student body, Student Senate does not condone the current
policy. Student Senate does not want the international students of Gettysburg
College to look or feel like diversity tokens. Please reevaluate this policy with a
humane outlook. Also, please remember that the first page of the College's
1997-1998 handbook states, "It is the policy of Gettysburg College not to
discriminate improperly any matriculated student... on account of... national
origin..." Senate looks forward to hearing directly from you in a short time.

To the Editor:

Casey is gone. Her life
has been celebrated in
many wonderful ways this
past ten days. However we
should not forget all those
who went before her; those
students who died in auto
mobile and other accidents,
untimely losses like the
Biser boys, and faculty, stu
dents, staff and administra
tors who have died from
terminal illnesses or by
their own hand. Also on
Veterans or Armistice Day,
we cannot forget our Vets
who fought for us and
some of whom gave their
lives and did not return.
What about all the

other folks we know, fam
ily and friends, who suffer.
Shouldn't we celebrate
Casey's life by reaching out
to these folks before it is
too late? For many of us
Thanksgiving Break pro
vides our first big opportu
nity. Thanks 'Burgian staff
for a great last issue and to
all those who helped us
deal with our grief and
pain. Casey I know would
be proud of you as you gave
selflessly.

Conflict and Consensus -
The Pachyderm's Pulpit

Coming soon, a primary that means something

by John Dunlap
Staff Writer Last week the Gettysburg
College Republicans heard
form Charles Gerow_, who is a
republican candidate for Con
gress right here in the nine
teenth congressional district of
Pennsylvania. What is interest
ing about Mr. Gerow's candi
dacy is that this district already
has a republican congressman,
Bill Goodling. In the last elec
toral cycle, Mr. Gerow chal
lenged Congressman Goodling
and received a surprisingly
good 45 percent of the vote.
Now Charlie Gerow is back
and Bill Goodling is worried.
Today a battle is raging
inside both political parties
over their individual identities.

In the Democratic Party, as
President Bill Clinton attempts
to make his party become more
moderate he finds 80 percent
of the Democrats in Congress
abandoning him on trade and
siding with the left-wing labor
unions. In the GOP, New Jer
sey Governor Christine Todd
Whitman was almost defeated
earlier this month because 7
percent of the electorate who
was pro-life abandoned the
Governor for third-party can
didates because of her ardent
pro-choice stance. The ideo
logues in both parties are still
driving the parties and while
sometimes they may hurt in a
general election, they can not
be forgotten because they are
the foot soldiers in both major
political parties. Here in south
central Pennsylvania a battle is
will occur next spring over
what direction willhardcore

Republicans follow, a more stri
dent conservative approach or
the more moderate to conser
vative approach.
This primary will for all
intents and purposes decide
who will represent York,
Adams, and Cumberland
Counties in the United States
House of Representatives. Re
publicans have an almost two
to one registration edge and
Goodling won last year with
63% of the vote against his
Democrat challenger, Scott
Chronister. The last time this
district sent a democrat to
Washington was in 1964 when
Congressman George
Goodling, the father of the cur
rent incumbent, was defeated
in the Lyndon Johnson land
slide. Two years later George
Goodling took the seat back
and since then only he and his
son have held it. When George
Goodling retired in 1974, his
son, Bill, succeeded him.

Before Bill Goodling
came to Congress his life was
that of an educator. He was a
teacher, coach, and administra
tor. Eventually, he became a
York County School Superin
tendent. Goodling's life has
been teaching and in the Con
gress education issues are his
main areas of interest.
For years the congress
man was part of the Republi
can minority in the House. He
and his colleague's main duty
was defending Republican
Presidents of the United States
and fighting the Democrat ma
jority. Year after year, York,
Hanover, and Gettysburg sent
Bill Goodling back to Congress

with no trouble at all. In 1992,
however, Congressman
Goodling hit trouble when he
was part of the House check
bouncing scandal. He was still
reelected in a competitive
three-party race with 47per
cent of the vote. In 1994, the
role that Bill Goodling played
in Congress changed as the re
publican party won control of
Congress for the first time in
40 years. Goodling who ran
unopposed in '94 became the
Chairmen of the House Com
mittee on Education and Work
place. Goodling was part of the
republican team led by House
Speaker Newt Gingrich that
enacting the most comprehen
sive domestic reforms since the
1960_'s.

This year it was Bill
Goodling who received na
tional attention for his battle
with President Clinton over the
Administration's national stan
dardized testing plan. Last
week an agreement was
reached with the President to
hold off any testing for now.
Goodling, has had to defend
the Republican education and
labor agenda which have meant
that the liberal unions have hit
him hard.
For almost three years
chairman Goodling has stood
resolute. He is one of many Re
publicans who over the years
have moved to the right,with
the country and both major po
litical parties. Goodling under
went what I call the Reagan
change. In 1980, Bill Goodling
chaired George Bush's presi
dential campaign in Pennsylva
nia, but as we all know Ronald

Reagan swept the country that
year. Ronald Reagan moved
the whole country right, and he
went from being called extreme
to defining what was main
stream. Goodling was not
alone, three of Reagan's pri
mary opponents in 1980
moved rightward and to this
day sing the 40th President of
the United States praises,
George Bush, Bob Dole, and
Howard Baker.
On certain issues, Bill
Goodling stands alone among
most republicans. On educa
tion while he has lead the fight
against President Clinton's na
tional education agenda, he at

the same time believes there
should be a very limited federal
role in education. That is why
he opposes the abolishment of
the Federal Department of
Education. Other republicans,
such as Jim Gilmore who last
week was elected Governor of
Virginia are now adopting
Goodling's approach. Gilmore
instead of talking about cuts
talked about reforms and he
won resoundingly. Goodling
also differs with most of the
GOP on the death penalty. He
opposes the death penalty out
of conscience, which is an is
sue I respect him on since I
agree with him.

On most other issues, Bill
Goodling is your standard re
publican. He supports tax cuts,
reducing the size and scope of
the government, and is pro-life
on abortion. However, it is
that handful of issues along
with his 24 years in Congress
that Charlie Gerow is blasting
him on.

This race is close to home
since Charlie Gerow today is
teaching here in the Manage
ment Department. Some of his
fellow professors have raised
eyebrows over a candidate for
Congress being hired just as he
begins his campaign. Beyond
teaching, Gerow heads the
Pennsylvania Citizens Against
Government Waste. Charlie
Gerow is an articulate, commit
ted conservative and I respect
him for that. The College Re
publicans have met both and I
have come to spend a lot of
time with Chairmen Goodling.
He has spoken before our
campus's Student Senate and
has hosted the College Repub¬

licans in Washington. I have
come to like and respect him.
If Bill Goodling is un
seated in the primary than that
is a defeat for House Speaker
Gingrich and congressional re
publicans. The GOP will be
pushed even further right and
while I have not been happy
with republicans this year in
their failure take on the Presi
dent, I do understand that the
GOP must work to bring Bill
Clinton closer to our side if we
want to accomplish anything.
What Republicans do not need
now is an internal battle that
distracts from their agenda of
cutting taxes, balancing the
budget, and enacting common
sense education reforms. Since

a primary battle will occur all
around us then I look forward
to following it and, hopefully,
participating in it.

Hot tea in the morning—toast and

bloom. The sun is shining through a

on days like this. Enjoy existence.
Of course life is not without its little

Cross country team keeps on trucking....

by Peter Huminski
Staff Writer The heavy rains and
hilly course could not slow
down the Gettysburg College
cross country teams at the Cen
tennial Conference champion
ships on Saturday at Ursinus
College. The men's team had a
strong showing,they finished in
third place with 70 points.
Haverford won the team title
for the sixth consecutive time
scoring 22 points. F & M fin
ished second with 58 points.
Leading the Bullets
was junior Kris Weum who fin
ished sixth in a time of 28:56.
Weum's finish earned him first
team all-conference honors.
"It was an outstanding
meet for Weum," said Bullets
coach Robert Condon. "They
did a great job as a team. I
don't see how they could have
done anymore on that day."

The Bullet men also
had two other runners earn
honors on Saturday. Seniors Ja
son Smith and James Smith
earned all-conference second
team honors. Jason Smith fin
ished ninth in a time of 29:05,
while James Smith finished
number 13 in a time of 29:26.
Rounding out the Bul
lets top seven were Brendon
Clark (16, 29:32), Jon Catlett
(27 30:01), Dave Gary (29,
30:12), and Brian Rusignuolo
(37, 30:41).

"Jon gave a great ef
fort, despite coming off of an
injury," said Condon. "Brian
(Rusignuolo) has been making
steady progress and improve
ment, which is what he needs
to do. He has been pushing
harder in the workouts and he
may have been a little tired on
the hilly course."
Without their top two
runners because of the GRE's
the Bullet women were not able
to fair as well as the men fin
ishing in eighth place with 194
points. Dickinson won the
women's team title with 32
points. Leading the Bullet
women was senior Joyce
O'Neil. O'Neil finished 18 in
a time of 20:31.

"I was pleased with
Joyce," said Condon. "She re
ally ran well. She was up in the
top five for most of the race,
and then I think that the hills
caught up to her at the end.
That it was a nice solid effort,
she didn't sit back and play it
safe. Come regionals I think
she will be able to hang in there
and finish high up there."
The Bullets next fin
isher was Karen Helmick who
finished the tough 3.1 mile
course in Hunsberger Woods in
a time of 20:59. Her time was
good enough for placing.
Rounding out the rest
of the women's top finishers
were Kristin Mills (45, 21:55),
Kelley Lord (48, 22:01), Tracy

Swackhammer (53, 22:10),
Kim Heimerl (54, 22:11), and
Jen Wise (55, 22:16).
"We had a couple of
women sick,"said Condon.
"Kim Heimerl was really sick
on Monday. She had a sub-par
performance because of it.
When you are sick, and run
ning in the rain, and on a hilly
course it takes a lot out of your
performance."
The Bullets next race
is on November 15, when they
head up to Dickinson to com
pete in the NCAA East Re-

pnoto Dy MarkAstrom
All-World volleyball player Cat Schott (15) says, "Not in my house," to the opposing spike.

gional meet. In the guys race,
the top two teams qualify for
Nationals which will be held in
Boston. For the women, the
top four teams qualify.
Condon is optimistic
about his teams chances at the
meet. "We are looking forward
to the regional because we
know we have some room to
move," said Condon about the
guys team. "One of our goals
is to beat F&M. If we do that,
we should be in the running to
beat Carnegie Mellon, the team

right ahead of them. I think
we will be one of the top four
teams in the region."
In the girls race,
Condon is looking forward to
getting Wendy Johnston and
Martie Callelo back. "When we
get our top two runners back,
I think we will finish in the top
10 teams," said Condon. "I
also think that if we keep run
ning like we are, we could have
a couple of runners qualify in
dividually for nationals if we
don't qualify as a team."

As college basketball season begins, we reflect on the
Loss of a legend

by Peter Huminski
Staff Writer October 9, 1997 marked
the end of an era in college bas
ketball. This is the day that
Dean Edward Smith retired as
head basketball coach from the
University of North Carolina.
There is only one word to
describe Dean Smith: class. For
36 years he graced the sidelines
as coach in North Carolina. He
won 879, games more than any
other coach in college basket
ball history. He lead North
Carolina to two National
Championships, 11 Final Four
appearances, and 33 consecu
tive top three finishes in the
ACC (the Atlantic Coast Con
ference, the premier confer
ence in college basketball).
These statistics are amaz
ing, but the thing that is even
more amazing is that he did it
without ever having an NCAA
violation claim against him.

To his players Smith was
more than a coach, he was a
father figure and a mentor.
"He's a father figure to a lot of
players and a lot of people,"
said Michael Jordan. "That's
how he's always been, very
genuine in his attitude toward
the players."
Jordan became the star
player we all know today
thanks in part to Smith's tute
lage. Jordan led the Tar Heels
to their first NCAA title under
Smith in 1982. Jordan, then a
freshman, hit the game winning
shot to beat the Georgetown
Hoyas. Jordan came back to
Chapel Hill and won NCAA
player of the year for 1983 and
1984. Showing his unselfish
love for his players Smith ad
vised Jordan to leave school

after his junior year. He
thought that my skill level was
ready for the pros," said Jor
dan. "He felt I needed a big
ger challenge and advised me
to go."
Smith set up a scholarship
fund for his former players who
left UNC early to pursue a ca¬

reer in basketball. He knew the
true value of a college educa
tion. In his retirement press
conference, Smith said that it
is sad that the school did not
make this big a deal over a
Nobel laureate retiring.
Coach Smith had to be
convinced to return to Carolina
last season, becatise he was al
most embarrassed about break
ing the legendary Adolph
Rupp's record of 876 career
coaching victories.
In a show of his unself
ishness and his respect for the
game, Smith did not want to
break the record. People close
to Smith convinced him that his
success was the wrong reason
to leave the game, so Smith re
turned. On March 15, 1997, m
the Tar Heels defeated The
Fairfield Stags in the first round
of the NCAA tournament to
give coach Smith victory num
ber 877.

Tar Heel fans need not
worry about falling from the
top of the college basketball
world just yet. Smith has
handed over the coaching
reigns to his long time assistant
Bill Guthridge. "He
(Guthridge) has learned well
from the master and he is ready
and eager to do the job," said
UNC athletic director Dick
Baddour.
Guthridge, who was
Smith's assistant for 30 years at
UNC, has a lot of talented play
ers returning. Guthridge has
the support of the players so
UNC should be up to its old
winning ways down on To
bacco Road.
"It's like you're losing
your father, but he's being re
placed with your uncle," said
Tar Heels center Antawn
Jamison.

"He's not as soft-spoken
as he looks," said Ademola
Okulaja. "He's very active, es
pecially at practice, and he's got
everyone's respect because of
his knowledge of the game."
Guthridge was Smith's
first choice as his successor, and

Smith made sure his long time
assistant was rewarded with a
long term contract.
Guthridge's hiring epitomizes
Smith's loyalty and unselfish

class. "Coach Guthridge is one
of the great coaches," said
Smith. "He's turned down
head coaching jobs before, and
now he's got one."

Smith will always be
missed not because of his ac
complishments on the court
but for his respect, loyalty, and
friendship off it.

The first half of play was

member Name: Mike Graham
Age: 20

Major: History
Minor: Education
Year: Junior
Hobbies/Interests: Sports
& Movies Mike Graham is a jun
ior transfer student playing
middle linebacker for the Bul
lets football team this season.
What is different about Mike
is that he happens to also be
born and raised here in the
Gettysburg community. So,
this semester is a new beginning
in familiar settings for the Get
tysburg defenseman.

Mike began his ath
letic and academic career at
Gettysburg Area High School.
There, he played both football
and basketball, and was the
team captain of each team as
well. While at Gettysburg
High, due to his personality
and his ability to work well
with others, Mike was advised
to pursue a career in education.
(Even though, his original hope
was to attend film school, due
to his fondness of movies.)
During this time in his
childhood and young adult
hood, Mike had the opportu
nity to play with and become
friends of one Brandon
Streeter. Mike can still recall
meeting Brandon's father,
Coach Barry Streeter of the
Gettysburg Bullets football
team, around sixth or seventh

grade. This relationship with
Coach Streeter would end up
helping Mike in the future.
After finishing high
school, Mike looked at several
colleges, including Gettysburg
College, but chose
Susquehanna University. Mike
based his whole coHege deci
sion on the best financial aid
package that he received. That
decision would eventually
come back to haunt him in the
future. After two years of
school and football in
Susquehanna, Mike decided
that he needed a change. He
described it as, " ...the situation
just didn't feel right. After two

nences at Gettysburg College
are much better than those at
Susquehanna.
When comparing the
schools, he believes that the
college community is much
more personable, the campus is
kept up better, and the academ
ics are more challenging.
Mike is also enjoying his
football career a lot more . In
contrasting his two college
football teams, he feels the Bul
lets are closer and more orga
nized than his old Susquehanna
squad. Mike also favors the

Gettysburg football program's
dedication to guide its players
athletically and academically.
Mike Graham has seen
his college move as, " A new
beginning for me." This view
happens to also be the reason
why Mike now sports a shaved
head for new college experi
ence in Gettysburg. As for his
plans for the future, Mike
could actually see himself liv
ing and teaching in Gettysburg.
(Even though he insists, "I am
not afraid to go anywhere
else!")

years, I felt as though I had to
do something else."
As Mike began exploring
his options, Gettysburg College
became his clear choice. In ad
dition to it being not so foreign
to him, he already had personal
relationships with some of the
faculty, including Coach
Streeter. Mike had no problem
going to college close to his
home, because he feels, "A
myth about college is that
people believe 'the further
away, the better'; but in all ac
tuality, fifteen minutes away
could be like going to college
in another state."
So far, Mike's new expe-

Mike says he has matured
a lot since his earlier days in
Gettysburg, and hopes that
Gettysburg College will con
tinue to make his transfer de
cision worthwhile.

WHERE IT'S AT...

With all of her talent, and skills to hoot, this BECK(y) is anything but a loser.

Field hockey has been a
way of life for senior Becky
Griffith for as long as she can
remember. AH through el
ementary school Becky went to
field hockey games with her
mom, Kris, who was a field
hockey player in high school.
Even Becky's baby-sitter played
field hockey. When Griffith
was finally old enough to join
her own team it seemed the
natural thing to do.
Griffith began her field
hockey career in the seventh
grade. "I played on the fresh
man team," Becky said, "they
put all the seventh and eighth
graders on that team." Being a
part of a team was not new to
Griffith, who had been playing
soccer since third grade.

Staff Writer

Becky continued to play
soccer in the spring and field
hockey in the fall through out
her four years at Cedar Cliff
High School in Camp Hill,
Pennsylvania. In addition to
playing field hockey and soc
cer, Griffith was a gymnast for
ten years.
In high school, Becky
longed to play forward, but
since so many others also
wanted to play that position,
she stepped back. "I played
link," she explained, "it is just
like midfield- [the position] I
played in soccer." In 1994,
when Becky came to Gettys
burg ,she was finally able to live
out her dream and play for
ward. Griffith followed her

mother to her alma mater, Get
tysburg, but insists it was not a
family tradition. "I didn't even
want to go to Gettysburg," said
Becky, "but, when I came to see
the campus, took a tour and
meet coach- I loved it."
Becky has had quite an
impressive field hockey career
in Gettysburg. She was a
starter for all four years and
started and played in every
game since her freshman year.
As a junior, Becky broke the

record for most assists in a sea
son (15), along with the record
for most assists in a career (25).
As a forward who con
stantly scored, Becky broke the
record for most goals in a sea
son (14) her senior year, and
was just shy of attaining the
record for most goals in a ca
reer. Griffith scored 39 goals
in her career, four goals short
of the record 43.
Becky, a "scoring ma
chine", as Gettysburg field
hockey coach Carol Daly calls
her, has also won a number of
honors for her excellent play
ing. Griffith was named as a
first-team Centennial Confer
ence All-Star as a sophomore
and junior, and will probably
receive the same honor this sea
son as a senior (the teams have
not yet been chosen).

Despite all of her awards and accomplishments, Becky Griffith is a big fan of humble pie.

As a sophomore, Becky
was selected as a Regional Ail
American, and her junior year
she was named a National All
American, an honor she will
most likely repeat this year.
This week Becky learned
that she made the North/South
Division III All-Star Game. She
will play at the University of

Connecticut on November 21st
in connection with the Division
I National Championships. In
addition to this huge honor,
Coach Daly nominated Becky
for the Centennial Conference
Player of the Year, a nomina
tion which is in itself a great
accolade.
A two-year team captain,
Becky displays her leadership
skills both on and off the field.
"Becky demonstrates her lead
ership through her playing and
[her] work ethic," explained
Coach Daly. "It is hard to dif
ferentiate between a game and
practice with Becky."
"In practice I always want
to do my best," explained
Griffith. "I try to impress my
coaches so that they know that
I am always trying."
Coaching Becky has been
a delight for Coach Daly. "It is
a pleasure to coach a kid with
a game face on every moment,"
said Daly.

We have been very lor
tunate to have her, she has been
a large help to the success of
our team." Becky was always a
large threat to any opponent.
For Gettysburg field hockey,
Becky played many key roles.

"She was a rusher on de
fensive corners and a hitter-out
on offensive corners," ex
plained Coach Daly, "[she also]
often took the penalty stroke."
Becky's athletic
ability_.though great is not her
most memorable trait. Her
sportsmanship and humble na
ture stand out most. "She is a
very high caliber athlete," com
mented Coach Daly. "Becky is
one of the finest hockey play
ers to go through our program
and she handles it all very hum
bly. [She] is very unassuming."
"We focus on one game at
a time and that got us where
we want to be," said Griffith,
talking about the field hockey
team making the ECAC tour
nament this past weekend.

Griffith was very excited
with the opportunity to play in
the post season playoffs. Go
ing into the game she had the
chance to break the record for
most goals in a career, but as is
her nature Griffith was not
worried about that.
"Getting the goal record
is not something I would like
to focus on," she said, "I don't
want to put that kind of pres
sure on myself." Becky would

rather focus on the close knit
friendships formed on the play
ing field.
When she came to Get
tysburg, as a freshman, the field
hockey team was much closer
than her team had been in high
school. "I really looked up to
all the seniors my freshman
year," she said, "we still talk
about that season."
Becky was impressed
with the mutual respect on the
team and how the upperclass
men took the time to teach re
spect to the freshmen. "Now I

really enjoy teaching that [re
spect] to the underclass,"
Griffith noted. This season
Becky was especially excited
that Kristen Stuckel joined
Gettysburg's field hockey
coaching staff. Stuckel was a
senior on Gettysburg's team
when Griffith was a freshman.
Becky works very hard in
all aspects of her life. A health
and exercise science major,
Griffith puts a lot of time and
hard work into her academic
work. "I try as hard as I can
and take school very seriously,"
she said, "I have to work hard
for my grades."

In addition to her great
role on the field hockey team,
Becky finds time to be a mem
ber of Chi Omega, and to be a
part of the Senior Scholarship
Committee. Griffith is also em
ployed by Campus Recreation
where she works at the infor
mation desk, in the weight
room and does the statistics for
the men's basketball games.
"[Becky] is a true sports
man, I don't want her to gradu
ate," said Coach Daly fondly.
Becky will miss playing field
hockey just as her coaches and
teammates will miss playing
with her.
"It's hard to believe it's
almost over, some of my best
memories come from playing
on this team," said Becky. As
Becky goes into the North/
South Division III All-Star
Game and then out into the
"real world" those memories
will keep her happy.

Football cursed by Red Devils, burn 35-14

by Chris Lunardi
Contributing Writer
In a game that was built
up as a battle for pride, the
Gettysburg Bullets football
team lost to Dickinson, their
long time rivals from Carlisle.
Coming into the game, neither
team had a chance to win the
Centennial Conference as Get
tysburg and Dickinson had
records of 4-5 and 3-6, respec
tively. This traditional game is
about much more that records
or conference championships,
however, and both teams knew
the game would be a war.

Neither team scored on
an opening drive, but
Dickinson was the first to crack
the Scoreboard with a touch
down midway through the first
quarter. The two teams went
back and forth for much of the
second half, until Dickinson
threatened to score with time
running down in the half. With
only a few minutes to go, a Red
Devil receiver made a fingertip
catch in the corner of the
endzone to give the visitors a
two touchdown lead going into
halftime.
The Gettysburg offense

took the ball to start the sec
ond half, but put a bullet in its
own foot by turning the ball
over to the Devils. Dickinson
went on to score and take a 21
0 lead early in the second half.
From then on the two teams
battled, trading hard hit for
hard hit all through the rest of
the game. The Bullet offense
began clicking and the result
was a Paul Smith touchdown to
cut the lead to 14. The other
Buiiet touchdown came at the
end of a long drive in which
Smith carried the load, and
many Red Devil defenders, to
move the ball down the field.
Matt Helwig capped the drive
by getting into endzone on a
handoff from the QB Dennis
Flaherty.

Despite the Bullets best
efforts, the final score was
Dickinson 35, Gettysburg 14.
Although it was a disappoint
ing loss, there were some sil
ver linings on this cloudy day.
Seniors Kevin Gurski, Joe
Hodakoski and Junior Jason
Osborn had big days on de
fense, and there were some
outstanding performances
turned in on the offensive side

of the ball. Junior Jeff Closz
had ten catches for 137 yards,
and came up with many crucial
first down catches. Sophomore
Paul Smith continued his great
season by breaking 1000 rush
ing yards and 2000 all-purpose
yards with a 35 yard romp
through the Dickinson defense.
The most impressive statistic
about Smith this season is that
he currently leads the nation,
yes, the nation, in Division III
ail-purpose-yards.
These individual perfor
mances do not take the sting
away from this loss for the Bul
lets. The unfortunate thing
about football is that you only
get one chance to play a team
each year. This means that the
Bullets will have to wait an
other year to avenge this loss.
The great thing about football
is that you always get to come
back and play again next week
(well, not after this week, but
almost always). The team has
now turned its attention to this

weeks game with Franklin and
Marshall. F & M is
Gettysburg's oldest rivalry, and
also one of its most bitter. De
spite the ups and downs that

this team has gone through this
year, there is no question that
a win in Lancaster this week
will make this season for the
Bullets. In case you needed a
reason to come see the game
on Saturday, it will be the last

Freshman rocket-arm QB Dennis Flaherty looks downfield

time that this class of seniors
will lead the Bullets onto the
field. This writer will certainly
have a front row seat for the
game, and I would also like to
thank all the seniors for all they
have done. We'll miss you.

SENIORS SAY GOODBYE

Josh Eyler
Assistant Sports Editor
Good-bye. It is a word
that we have all said so many
times in our lives that we no
longer think about what it re
ally means. In fact we say it
everyday in some form or an
other. We've all said good-bye
to friends, family,
acquaintances,and people we
knew that we would never see
again. Most of the time it is easy
to say, other times it is not. The
Senior Bullets who have partici
pated on Fall Sports Teams are
arriving at one of the more dif
ficult times not as the season is
almost finished.
But how do you say
good-bye to something that

you have put so much time in
through the years. Something
that you've trained for day in
and day out. Something that
you've practiced since you
could remember. Something
that has made you rejoice in
victory and cry in defeat.
Something that has been
a part of you for so long that it
almost defines the person that
you are. It is not easy.
The time has passed that
these men and women will
wear the Bullet orange and blue
to score a goal, throw a touch
down, run a race, or spike a
volleyball.
So many different seniors
that I asked said much of the
same things when asked about
their time here at Gettysburg.
Many said that they would miss
the friends that they had made,

the closeness of the teams, the
wins. Some said that their re
spective sports had taught them
a lot about life, even the blow
out losses. I think that Rob
Sena, senior captain and defen
sive back of the football team,
expresses these sentiments the
best, though: "I don't know
what I'm going to do now that
I don't have it (football) to train
for. I've loved it, it has meant
the world to me, and nothing,
I don't think, will ever compare
to it." On behalf of all the se
niors, from the stars to the un
sung heroes, for whom this ar
ticle was written...
Good-bye.
"I do not fear tomorrow
because I have seen yesterday
and I love today."
