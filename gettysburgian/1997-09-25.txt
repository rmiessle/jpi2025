Senate works?

Budget reduction leads to 20 percent budget cuts for Senate-sponsored student organizations

In 1994, Student Senate succeeded in getting the library to stay open 24 hours. Is the current budget situation preventing Senate from working?

by Ann Marie Bielli
Staffwriter

Due to a budget cut from the Office
of College Life, outstanding bills from last
year, and the formation of new organiza
tions, Gettysburg's Student Senate has had
to cut its own budget and those of various
organizations on campus by about 20%.
There are some discrepancies con
cerning the actual amount that was cut from
Senate's overall budget.
A memo issued at the first senate
meeting of the semester by Student Senate
Treasurer Sara Zalewski stated "when I re
ceived the budget for Student Senate this
year, I was aware that it had been cut by
about 5%."
But according to Julie Ramsey, Dean
of College Life, the actual amount that was

cut from the budget was one percent.
Zalewski's memo continued "There
were also outstanding bills I had to pay from
last year. After paying the bills, I began to
look at the allocations for the organizations.
Everyone was cut 20% of their last budget."
While the cuts have caused some com
motion, both Ramsey and Zalewski believe
these cuts may have actually done more
harm than good.
Traditionally, Student _Senate has been
given a budget of around $80,000 at the start
of the school year. This money is then allo
cated to sponsor various entertainment ac
tivities for the student body and also to fund
approximately 27 student-run organizations
on campus.
Each organization is allocated a cer
tain amount of money from the $80,000 to
help pay for their programming and activi¬

ties. If organizations find they need more
money, they are able to request this money
at Senate meetings and are usually granted
the amount asked for.
This system has worked fairly well for
a long time now, with one major flaw. Sen
ate usually does not use all the money in
their budget. This unused money, which
Dean Ramsey reported as being close to
$10,000 to $20,000 each year, is returned
to the College in may and placed in a "gen
eral college fund" to pay for extraneous
things such as utility bills for the school.
Dean Ramsey feels that such money
would be better spent on the students, for
whom the money was originally intended.
Ramsey emphasizes the fact that the budget
cut does not mean Student Senate cannot
do certain things. "There is no reason for a
good program to go to the wayside," she

said, "if more money is needed there is more
money available."
Ramsey believes that the situation has
"nothing to do with budget cuts, it has to do
with budget management." In the past,
money has been wasted by not being used
by the students and instead ending up in
"general college funds" to pay for bills.
Under this new system, student orga
nizations and Senate must now learn to be
better managers and to be accountable for
the money they spend.

Future looks bright to commission

Task force members optimistic about direction of College

by Rebecca M.Schantzenbach
staff writer

Nine different task forces,
composed of successful parents,
students, and alumni, were put to
gether to form Gettysburg's Com
mission on the Future.
The Commission was
formed by the College as part of a
plan to better prepare the students
of the next century. Members
meet to plan and discuss improve
ments that need to be made to the
College, as well a.s some improve
ments that have already been
made. The nine task forces are
as follows:

Collaborative Learning & Teamwork
Culture & the Arts
Economics &
Management Enhancing Residence
Life
Excellence in Science
and Technology
Public Affairs &
Public Service
Student Recruitment
& Retention
Supporting Student
Success.

Following the
Commission's luncheon last Sat
urday_.Sept. 20, several committee
members were asked to discuss
their role, and main objective for
the Commission. Most members
seemed positive an and optimis
tic about the future of Gettysburg.
Professor John Committo
and Kathy Falkenstein '72 were
on the Science & Psychology task
force. They both agreeed that the
sciences were strong at
Gettysburg, and both intended to
see that they are kept that way.
Jean Kirchoff '64 of the
Residence Life task force, and Bill
Kirchoff '63 of the Economics &
Management task force, both
agreeed that "There is more inter
action between students and fac
ulty than ever before."
Both felt that Gettysburg

can be a better place when stu
dents, faculty, and administration
are incorporated together more
closely.
Another alumnus returning
for the Commission was Greg
Islan '70, of the Information Tech
nology task force. The goal of this
group is to incorporate technology
into the curriculum.
He said "After 21 years, the
same issues are still coming up.
We need to find a way for the fac
ulty and students to use informa
tion technology most effectively."
John Cook '85, who served
on the Public Service task force,
was very impressed with the pub
lic service programs here on cam
pus. He spoke enthusiastically
about, recognizing its importance.
However, he sated that he would
like to see Gettysburg "expand the
awareness of publicaffairs on cam
pus." This would entail a focus on
civic responsibilities, voting, in
volvement, and other such areas.

Charles Black '60, of the
Economics & Management task
force, wants to see more global
ization of the Management and
Economics departments.
He stated that "it is impor
tant to realize that there are cul
tural differences all over the world.
It is necessary, especially for busi
ness majors, to know about these
differences and be aware of them."
„ One way in which he would
suggest promoting this would be
to have speakers come in from
companies that have experience
dealing with people with different
cultural backgrounds.
"It could also be beneficial
to listen to some professors and
students discuss the differences
they saw when they came here,"
he said.

These Committee members
all seemed optimistic about the
future of the College, and encour
aged the current state of the cam
pus environment.

'Burgian finalist in Pacemaker

FromStaf fRepor ts
When the Gettysburgian
published its first issue on March
9,1897, one of the goals it set for
itself was "to place the name
Gettysburg second to none."
One hundred years later, the
student newspaper is fulfilling that
goal. The Gettysburgian was
named a finalist for the National
Pacemaker Award, an honor that
is often described as "the Pulitzer
of student journalism."
Although the Gettysburgian
has won numerous local and na
tional awards in its long history, it
has never won the coveted Pace
maker.
Only 40 student newspapers
from colleges and universities
across the United States were se
lected as finalists. Winners will be
announced at the Associated Col¬

legiate Press Conference in Chi
cago on November 1.
"It is a great honor to be fi
nalists for such a prestigious
award," said Editor-in-Chief,
Rebecca Babbitt. "And it's nice to
have our hard work appreciated,
not just on campus, but by students
and professionals all over
America."
The Associated Collegiate
Press began presenting ' the award
in 1925. The Newspaper Associa
tion of America Foundation and
the ACP have cosponsored the
Pacemaker competition since
1971. A panel of judges lead by
Margaret Holt from the Chicago
Tribune judged the competition.
Entries were judged on coverage
and content, quality of writing and
reporting, leadership on the opin
ion page, evidence of in-depth re
porting, design, photography, art
and graphics.

edgeable criticism can show us
ways to begin measuring the ac
complishments of our poetic age.
Stitt's interest in these
poets is intellectual and aesthetic.
He uses his understanding of the
philosophical implications inher
ent in modern physics, as they ap
ply to both content and form, as
the basis of his close analysis.
He attends to the poets'
writerly strategies so that we may
discover in their poetry where "sur
face form" intersects and comple
ments meaning and thus becomes,
in John Berryman's terms, "deep
form." He explains what these po
ets say and how they say it and
what relationships lie between. He
shows how humor plays a part in
some of their work.
Stitt's previous book of
poetry criticism was selected as
one of the Outstanding Academic
Books of the Year by Choice maga¬

. Donald Hall says, ""Peter
Stitt writes with a warm familiar
ity of poetry that he admires, and
he is also willing to make distinc
tions in the work of poets he on
the whole admires, and by his
negatives gives us some chance to

determine the justice of his gen
eral judgements."
In addition to editing the
Gettysburg Review, Peter Stitt is
professor of English at
Gettysburg College. In 1993 he
was chosen as the first recipient
of the PEN/Nora Magid Award
for excellence in editing. His
writings appear regularly in the
Paris Review, New York Times
Book Review, Georgia Review,
and many other publications.

BUDGET

from p 1
Sara Zalewski also be
lieves the budget cuts are a good
learning experience. When asked
about how she felt about the cuts,
she responded by saying, "I was
disappointed but it is just one of
those things you have to deal
with. . , these budget puts ,are
teaching organizations how ' to_^e
more responsible with their
spending."
Senate has not had to cut
any activities that they usually
sponsor. They recently spon
sored the very successful Shrimp
Fest, and major events such as
the Snow Ball are still yet to

come. Senate is currently looking
into cosponsoring social events
with the Student Activities Coun
cil. By combining ' forces, Sara
believes that they can bring lo
geth'6r l 'their mo'ney and their
ideas to have larger, higher qual
ity social events.
Jen Miluk, president of
SAC, agrees. She said that SAC

is interested in increasing the num
ber of all-campus events, in order to
incorporate more groups.
She feels that with the social
scene rapidly changing on campus,
it is important to provide more op
tions to the student body.
Individual organizations on
campus funded by Senate have made
changes to adapt to the budget cuts.

... these budget
cuts are teaching
organizations how
to be more re
sponsible with
their spending."
Sara Zalewski
Bryan Roberts, treasurer of
the Gettysburg Environmental
Concerns Organization (GECO),
said the cuts were "kindof a shock,
but they were understandable."
GECO plans to make up the reduc¬ r _Y

tion in its budget through fund
raising activities. When asked if
the organization was going to have
to cut certain programs this year,
Roberts replied, "No, we are plan
ning more activities this year."
Jaime Foanio, treasurer of
Alpha Phi Omega, the coe.d service
fraternity on campus believed that
the cuts weren't that big of a prob
lem. Alpha J?hi Omega is
/ planning a _little differently
and watching their spending
closely.

Zalewski's memo noted
that "We are all being com
promised here. However, I

r . .•
feel all will work out fine.. My
best advice is to spend what you
need, not what you want. To lower
further costs, look to /our fellow

Surfing the' Burg with CNAV

by Melodie Foster
Staff Writer
How do they do that? You
know, those people who knew
your phone number before you
did, the ones who seem to be
around every time you get out of
class, who know more about you
than you yourself do? How did
they get all this information?
Maybe they're working for the
FBI, maybe they're a spy, or
maybe they just logged on to
Gettysburg's new computer sys
tem, CNAV.
Affectionately know as
StalkerNet, the system allows stu
dents to search for people by
name, email address, interests, and
can match them up with classes,
clubs, and events compatible with
their interests.

Gettysburg's newest technological advancement proving itself useful to students and faculty

_oe useu
the inactivity and apathy that can
be found on campus.
The program allows students
to access a vast amount of informa
tion pertinent to them simply,
quickly and conveniently, in many
cases without ever leaving their
rooms. Sophomore Alex Caswell
had this to say about CNAV: "It's a
very handy tool to look up people's
phone numbers, see upcoming
events, explore aliases, and put
events on calendar."
Caswell has spent a lot of
time with the program, so knows
very well how it works. "I've
worked with it a lot, so it's handy. I
like the versatility of the program,
how you can customize it to your
personal preferences. You can find
out about everyone in your classes,
email them, and get their numbers.
The survey function is pretty cool,
too." com

Though new to most of the
student body this fall, CNAV, the
Curriculum Navigation Tool, has
been in the works for almost two
years. The development team,
headed by Mike Martys, set up
CNAV with the hopes of reducing
the effects of the common "stu
dents don't know what they don't
know" syndrome.
To silence the cries of "oh,
I wish I'd know about that two
years ago," and "well, I didn't
know that was this Tuesday," and
to bring students out of hiding by
presenting them with options
rather than making them search
for them.
CNAV works on a principle
of puzzle pieces, says Martys. It
takes all the information about
clubs, classes, activities, and
people on campus and, using these
bits of information it knows about
you (from your official records
and what you provide), arranges
the 'pieces' in a way that corre
sponds to what you would be most
interested in.

"We try to make good acci
dents happen," says CNAV team
member Don Redman.
Every student has a CNAV
account. First-year students au
tomatically have access, but up
perclassmen must sign up. This
can be done simply by emailing

cnav@gettysburg.edu with a
short note saying you would
like to access your CNAV ac
count. You will be emailed
back a temporary password that
will allow you to log-on for the
first time.
Some upperclassmen,
though, do know how to use
CNAV. Some learned last year.
This summer, the RAs, Orien¬

tation Lead
ers, and the
sports teams
all learned
to use the
system be
fore regis
tration.

The Cool Stuff page dis
plays a schedule of events occur

to the interests you have chosen
from the multitude supplied on
lists under various subject head
ings. CNAV also gives students
the ability to create special in¬

announcing meetings and send

organizations much easier. All
you have to do is get a name for
your group, add the email ad

By tilling out the Interests sec
tion in My Place, you can find other
people with similar interests. This
fulfills one of the goals of CNAV,
which is to help the campus commu
nity grow closer.
Out of 258 responses to a sur
vey posted on the program (yet an
other use of CNAV), less than twenty
people found any aspect of CNAV to
be completely negative. 197 of the

I responses were
very positive,
I saying that they
liked the concept
of CNAV "very
much." Over
200 of the re
sponses were
quite positive on
everything: the
student informa
tion, the search
engines, the sur
vey tool, the look
and the feel, and
the layout.
91 of the
I respondants think that the
people in charge
of CNAV should
focus on the stu
dent information
part of CNAV; 73
believe the focus
should be on the
surveys.
C o m -
plaints con
cerned issues
such as the limi
tations of the in
formation avail
able, the interest
lists and privacy.
This is the most
commonly heard
complaint; stu
dents fear com¬

plete strangers can discover too much
about them, even that the network aids
stalkers.
This may be true, but much of
the information now available on
CNAV was available on the gopher
system beforehand. There is also a

cumuai
system ol checks and balances built
into the program to ensure the se
curity of the information made
available. There are four types of
accounts: student, faculty, admin
istrator, and staff, each with its own
level of access.
With the exception of a pic
ture in your class rosters (where
people will see you anyway), no in
formation about you can be made
available about you if you do not
want it to be.
It is possible to keep almost
everything private, but this defeats
the purpose of the program, which
is supposed to link people, places
and events together by collecting
and matching information about
them. Overall, the addition of
CNAV to the campus computer sys
tem has been a successful endeavor.
The program has fallen remarkably
close to its original goals and in
tentions, and, if used properly,
could he used to bat much of

CNAV is a program that was
created to benefit the campus and
the students; the development team
is open to suggestions, comments
and questions. They eagerly await
your thoughts at

Big names shake up Cop Land

byJonFr oehlich
Staff Writer
"Half the men I watch live
across my line of jurisdiction,
where no one's watching." - Moe
Tilden Cop Lan, starring Sylvester
Stallone, is dramatic from start to
finish. With a cast boasting names
like Harvey Keitel, Robert DeNiro
and Ray Liotta, Cop Land brings
people to the theaters and really
delivers what they want.
Freddy Heflin, played ex
cellently by Sylvester Stallone
(Rocky, Cliffhangef) is a New Jer¬

sey sheriff who has fallen about
as low as he can go. Kept out off
the police force on account of be
ing legally deaf in one ear after
saving a young girl from drown
ing, Freddy has started to expect
as little of himself as everyone else
does. Because his jurisdiction is
Cop Land (Garrison, NJ), a town
occupied almost exclusively by
dirty NYPD cops, Freddy is con
stantly being told to turn his back
and to "just go home." Under
standably, Freddy's life has worn
him down into a shell of a man
who has seemingly stopped car
ing.

Stallone plays this role to
perfection (he even put on 40
pounds for it) and lets all that is

Freddy Heflin project out to audi
ences. Freddy is calm and seem
ingly too laid back on the outside,
but Stallone makes it easy for
viewers to sense the frustrations
that eventually lead to the climax
of Cop Land.
On the other side of the law
is Ray Donlan, played by Harvey
Keitel (Pulp Fiction, Smoke). As
the head of all crime in Garrison,
Donlan takes the form of a NYPD
officer and apparent orchestrator
of Cop Land. He sees Freddy the
way most people do, a pushover
who is nothing to worry about. It
is with this attitude that Donlan
runs Garrison as a nest of crime

for dirty NYPD and assumes the
law can't reach him from across
the George Washington bridge.
The plot of "Cop Land" ig
nites when police officer Murray
"Super-Boy" Babitch jumps sus
piciously to his supposed demise
after it becomes apparent that he
may be under investigation. Un
der heavy cover, Babitch is taken
to Garrison where he is to be killed
and prevented from talking, as was
planned out by Donlan, his uncle.
It is this scandalous event that
causes the world of the small town
sheriff and that of a mob-infested
group of cops to collide and meld
into a movie full of drama, sus¬

pense and raw acting power.
Through Stallone's por
trayal, audiences are able to see
and appreciate Freddy's transfor
mation from a small time nobody
to what he has alwayswanted to
be: a real cop with real power.
After it is clear that Babitch is
alive, Freddy, with a new-found
realization of who he has become
and who he wants to be, vows to
go after "Super-Boy" and bring all
the various evils of Cop Land to
justice.
Though this theme may
seem like one synonymous with
the name Stallone, viewers get just
what they don't expect. We see in
Cop Land a different kind of re
venge-bent Stallone from what
we've become accustomed to in
movies such as Rambo and Co
bra. The rough edges that have
often stereotyped former Stallone
movies have been filed away in
Cop Land to reveal a truly tal
ented and composed actor.

Along with Stallone, other
good performances accentuate the
brilliant plot of Cop Land. Most
notable of these were those of
Robert DeNiro (Heat, Sleepers) as
Internal Affairs officer Moe
Tilden, and Ray Liotta (No Es
cape) as Freddy's apparent best
friend and fellow cop.

Though many of the events
of Cop Land involving the mob,
murder, scandal, justice, dirty
cops, clean cops and personal duty
are difficult ones, this movie
handles them well. With an ex
plosive scene near the end, in
which Director James Mangold

(who comes up big with this, only
his second movie) chooses to
simulate Freddy's near deafness
by turning the sound down to a
minimum, Cop Land turns out to
be a fantastically made movie with
a satisfying conclusion and a cast
to match.

The Craft

by Glen Beck
StaffWriter Imagine a movie that com
bines the sophistication and magic
of the Witches of Eastwick with
the teen appeal of Clueless. The
product of that merge would be
director Andrew Flemming's The
Craft. Now, I may have exagger
ated this comparison, but the film
is a sure draw for the college and
high school crowd. Many viewers
will recognize the actresses: Robin
Tunney (Empire Records) as Sa
rah, FairuzaBalk (The Island of Dr
Moreau, Return to Oz) as Nancy,
Neve Campbell (Scream) as
Bonnie, and Rachel True (No
where) as Rochelle.
Some people might sympa
thize with the theme and situation
of the film. The story unfolds as
the new kid in town, Sarah, finds
herself a misfit at her new high
school. After facing the jerk of the
school who recently spread rumors

In Case You Missed It...

about a nonsexual encounter, Sa
rah falls into a group of three other
social outcasts who dabble in the
occult.
When these four girls join up
together, they achieve unstoppable
power. Anything they want can be
accomplished, from snagging the
boy of their dreams to humiliating
the school's token stuck-up snob.
However, as with any
"ideal" situation, problems arise
and, as with any good movie, a
fight ensues (The Craft did win
the 1997 MTV Movie Award for
Best Fight Scene).
I won't give away who
emerges victorious. I will men
tion, though, that anyone who has
a fear of bugs or snakes might want
to refrain from watching the end
scene of the movie.
The film requires a "willing
suspension of disbelief' (a theater
term which implies that the viewer
must put aside some conventions

of reality and delve into the world
of the film or play) on the part of
the audience at a couple of points.
The four actresses playing
the leads look more college age
than high school. And, according
to a friend, some of the witchcraft
is highly exaggerated. However,
there are instances where the ac
tors enact the rituals correctly.
In any case, the film uses
some spectacular visual effects. In
one scene in particular, the cinema
tographer achieves a highly dra
matic shot where a mirror reflects
the opposite image of what should
be seen—very eerie.
Various tight shots express
the idea of being trapped, and
close-ups allow for expressive
moments.
All-in-all, the film offers
thrills, chills, and laughs. Go rent
the video and watch it with a
couple of friends. But watch out
for those snakes.

Coral reefs find anemone in man

byStephanieBusch
GECO Columnist
Coral reefs, which are found
in 109 countries throughout the
world, are in great danger. Mosl
have been damaged or completely
destroyed by human activity.
There are two major areas
of coral reefs in the world: the
Indo-Pacific region, which
stretches from southeast Asia
through Polynesia and Australia
eastward across the Indian Ocean
to Africa; and the Western Atlan
tic region, which stretches from
Florida to Brazil and the Red Sea,
located between Africa and Saudia
Arabia.
Two of the more popular
reef spots in the world are the
Great Barrier Reef near Australia,
and those in the Carnbean.

There are many threats to
the coral reefs, but the most dam
aging are sedimentation, human
run-off, fishing with explosives,
cyanide fishing, careless recre
ation, and global warming.
Sedimentation is the effect
when soil erosion occurs from log
ging, fanning, mining or inshore
construction, and the soil runs
downstream into the ocean. The
dirt, silt, or sand causes the water
to become turbid, cloudy and
muddy, which in turn prevents
sunlight from reaching the coral.

Without light, the coral reefs can
not survive.
Human run-off is caused by
the dumping of fertilizers and sew
age into the coastal waters. This
waste causes algae to rapidly pro
duce and use up a great deal of the
oxygen, as well as block the sun
light from reaching the coral, con
sequently chocking the reefs.
Fishing with explosives and
cyanide are also extremely detri
mental to the reefs. Fishing with
explosives is when fisherpeople
prepare bombs, place them in or
near the coral reef areas and when
the bombs explode it kills the fish.
These fish are then harvested, and
the reefs are to destroyed to a fine
crumble.
The cyanide fishing is when
commercial fishing fleets use cya
nide or other chemicals to capture
the fish by stunning them so that
the fish are still are alive when
they are sold. These poisons de
stroy the reefs as well as the other
creatures which live among the
reefs.

Recreation such as boating,
diving, and fishing can also be a
large contributor to destroying the
reefs, if not done carefully.
While vacationing, many
people take the chance and snor
kel, scuba dive, or just swim
around coral reefs. These beauti
ful natural wonders are huge tour¬

ist attractions in many popular va
cation spots.
Global warming is a tre
mendous threat to coral reefs be
cause not only does warming in
crease the water temperature,
which "bleaches" the reefs, but
heavy storm activity, which often
occurs due to global warming, can
also have an ill effect on the reefs
and their inhabitants.
When the ocean water be
comes too warm, the "coral pol
yps lose the symbiotic algae in
side of them causing the reefs to
turn white or "bleached' and even
tually die," according to the Coral
Reef Alliance.
Coral reefs are extremely
important because they provide
habitats for more than 25% of the
ocean's species. Coral reefs serve
many purposes in the maintaining
of marine life, such as a provider
of food, shelter, and protection to
various marine species, as well as
a nursery to growing fish, and
much more.

Roosters to crow
in Kline

by Ashley Br own
Contributing Writer
The Owl and Nightingale
Players are proud to present this
fall's main stage production of
Milcha Sanchez-Scott's Roosters
. This fiery and humorous drama
illustrates contemporary domes
tic life in the American South¬

west. Roosters, directed by Pro
fessor George Muschamp, set de
sign by Professor Jerome O.
Hanson, and choreographed by
Paula Kellinger, is geared to cap
tivate audiences with its sense of
"magical realism."
Performances will be held
in Kline Theater of Brua Hall at
8 o'clock on October 2, 3, 4, 6,
and 7. There will also be a mati
nee performance at 2 p.m. on
Sunday, October 5. Free tickets
may be obtained for Friday and
Saturday's shows beginning Sep
tember 25 in the Theater Office
at x6064.
Roosters is a story of love,
power, dreams, and delusions in
a Latino-American family. The
setting: a simple, pueblo-style
home in the American Southwest.
The family: a complexly diverse
group of confused individuals
searching for answers in a world
where help is unobtainable.

Legendary breeder of fight
ing cocks Gallo Morales (Robert
Thompson) returns home after
seven years in jail for manslaugh
ter. On the day of his return, his
20 year old son Hector (Dave
Shoffner) decides to fight a prize
bird inherited from his grandfa¬

ther (Jeremy Katz), and then ei
ther "eat it or sell it" for enough
money to get out of the valley.
The play centers on the
battle of supremacy between fa
ther and son. Drawn into the dis
pute are Hector's innocent sister
Angela (Jennifer MacMurtrie), his
lusty aunt Chata (Megan
Manthey), and his martyred
mother Juana (Samantha Gregg),
who only wants her family to live
in peace.
Rounding out the cast are
Paul Lapato as Adan, James Kohn,

Jeffrey Jones, Mary Cordero, and
Mike Ferrer as Shadows, Alec
Beekmans as Zapata, and Phil
Anderson as San Juan.
This slice of life, an explo
sive drama, attempts to answer
some of life's biggest mysteries
regarding power and survival.
Roosters asks whether any of us
can ever escape the fear of grow
ing up. The play also probes the
issues of forbidden lusts and pas
sions, such as gambling, and how
these passions are bound up in the
human experiences of family and
sexuality.

The production staff in
cludes Glen Beck as assistant di
rector, Zachary Alderfer as prop
manager, Duncan Niederer as
stage manager, Ashley Brown as
publicity, Tim Johnsen as the pro
duction coordinator/sound engi
neer, Jody Robertson as the stu

Documentary quilts together
woman's life experiences

Lunch Theater

by Justin Ether edge
Staff Writer
Professor Lynn _Hanley has
uncovered a rare and remarkable
jewel. With her documentary,
Penny Sisto: Fiber Artist, she has
done more than simply profile an
unusual artist, she has introduced
us to an extraordinary soul.
The subject of Professor
Hanley's first film project was
once an artist-in-residence here
nearly a decade ago. It didn't take
long, however, for Hanley to re
alize that Sisto was far more than
just an artist. And within the first
few minutes of the film, you find
out exactly what kind of lady she
really is.
First and foremost, Penny
Sisto is a storyteller. With a win
some Scottish accent and a

breezy, carefree manner, she re
calls with vivid accuracy tales of
her childhood, her extensive trav
els, and the history of her quilts.
She is brutally honest and open,
and seems just out of touch with
reality, which only makes her all
the more endearing.
But her stories cover the
gamut of emotions, often simul
taneously combining profound
sadness with a sobering humor.
In one of her most harrowing sto
ries, she tells with unflinching
realism of her days as a midwife
for an African tribe whose
women's vaginas had been gro¬

tesquely disligured in ritualized
circumcisions.
Sisto, who by her own ad
mission drops babies like flies,
also recollects squirting a
tribeswoman in the face with the
milk from her breast soon after
one of her own pregnancies, as if
that was the most natural thing in
the world to do.
Within each of her quilts lies
extensive stories, as well, both in

First and

teller."
the fabric and in the content of the
piece. She receives fabrics from
all over the world, from African
dresses to Indian silks to cuts of
Japanese wedding veils.
She is incredibly politically
minded, and one of her favorite
quilts features the image of Anita
Hill, crucified, hands impaled by
erect penises. That piece, at least
by the end of the filming, was still
unsold.
She has never had profes¬

sional training and works strictly
from memory. The most remark
able feature of her quilts may be,
however, the faces of the subjects.
She has an unusual sense of the
human essence that she manages
to capture in (he eyes of her work.
They truly are beautiful, but all the
more astonishing is that she
doesn't seem to have any real un
derstanding of what she creates.
Professor Hanley's project,
funded by a grant from Gettysburg
College, took a vision over two
years in the making and helped
turn it into a reality.
With her daughter Jasmine
to assist her with sound and cam
era work, Professor Hanley visited
Sisto this summer at her home
outside of Louisville, Kentucky.
Filming took less than a week, and
while the editing took much
longer, there is still a bit of sound
work to be done.
Nevertheless, Professor
Hanley is optimistic about the
commercial value of her docu¬

mentary.
Once all the sound problems
are resolved, she plans on send
ing copies to distributors in New
York City who specialize in films
both produced by and featuring
women. Also look for a copy
which soon will be made available
in the Musselman Library.

Dear Casey,
I have been dating this guy

my friends just don't seem to

Thanks,

Dear Lost in Love,
I think you need to get your
new man to drive you to Wal-Mart
so you can buy yourself a clue.
Don't procrastinate; I think they're
having a discount!
There a couple of things you
need to realize. First, unfortu
nately, the world is not centered
around you and not everyone
thinks you are God's gift to the
universe, even if you do.

friends. They arc most likely the
ones who are going to pick up the
pieces when things fall apart.
There's a saying that men
come and go, but your friends stay
with you through thick and thin.
Your boyfriend may be Mr. Right
for now, but in a month he could
be Mr. Wrong.
In the long run, two weeks
is not a long time, and it usually
takes much longer to form deep
bonds. If I were you, I would
watch your step and not go diving
into the pool of love, because you
might find it is a puddle.
Dear Casey,
Itseemsthatallther eisto

then, most of the parties seem

into dorm rooms, where the main
activity is drinking. This cannot
only often get boring, but can of
ten become dangerous.
I admire your strength in not
wanting to bend your belief sys
tem, even in the most pressured of
all drinking scenes, college. It
seems that more and more people
are taking a stand against the dan
gers of "binge drinking." Did you
know that one person every seven
minutes dies from an alcohol re
lated death?
So you might think that
there is nothing else to do on cam
pus except to drink. My best ad
vice is to get involved with clubs
and activities. Through this you
will be able to meet people who
perhaps have similar interests as
you do.

Dear Dry and Bored,
It does seem that in this day
and age, alcohol is the lubricant
to almost all socialization. I can
not count how many of my friends
have met their significant others
when either one or the other of
them was drunk. It is a sad, but
true. Of course, their ever-so-fond
memories of their first meeting are
often blurry and sometimes non
existent.
Also, it seems that many

There are also many school
sponsored events on the weekends
that are a lot of fun, and totally dry.
Try going to the Coffeehouse, start
dancing, and you're bound to meet
a lot of cool people.
It is all right to go to parties
and actually not drink. Some
people tend to think there are ta
boos attached to sober people at
parties, but I guarantee that you
can have a blast at a party without -
drinking, and not feel sick in the
morning. Besides, somebody has

people.

Conflict and Consensus

From the Donkey's The Pachyderm's Pulpit: First

Mouth: What's in a Lady isn't very lady like

name ?

by AndyZysk
Contributing Writer
"It's those liberals down in
Washington!...It's the liberals'
fault!" How many times have we
all heard these accusations, con
stantly thrown about by such po
litical figures as Rush Limbaugh
and Newt Gingrich? If we were
to actually believe all of these
statements, it would probably
seem that everything was the fault
of "those liberals." It almost seems
as if conservatives hide behind
these accusations in order to avoid
actual discussions of the issues.
Nowadays, it is a common re
sponse of many conservatives and
Republicans to say to a person,
"Oh, you're such a bleeding-heart
liberal!", when they are confronted
with ideas which actually portray
a humanistic side. What, however,
is in a name?

According to Webster's Dic
tionary of the English Language,
a liberal is an individual charac
terized by "a general enlarging of
the mind beyond the merely
professional...not subject to the
common prejudices or conven
tions" and is "in favor of individual
liberty and social reform." If you
ask me, this supposed insult really
doesn't hold up to close inspection.
In a world that is constantly chang
ing along national and interna
tional lines, those with the title
"liberal" will fair much better than
those with the name "conserva
tive." For can we really continue
to hold onto all of the beliefs of
the past like a security blanket
when confronted with a changing
global environment? I am not say
ing that it is necessary to totally
disregard the wisdom of our fore
fathers in the political and religious
realm

Unlike the conservative,
though, the liberal is willing to re
view the beliefs of the past for their
continued validity no matter what
the outcome. The liberal asks,
'Are there new ways to approach
this issue?" Throughout the devel¬

opment of humankind, an expand
ing and open mind has been a ne
cessity. What i f no one dared ques
tion the racial policies of the 60's
or attempted to see the potential
economic role of the nation's gov
ernment during the Great Depres
sion? For the benefit of all the
people who live within our
country's borders, we should at all
times attempt to see every side of
an issue and be willing to push the
limits toward a positive goal.
In the past year or so, Demo
crats across the nation have been
labeled as "bleeding-heart liber¬

als" for their earlier opposition to
dramatic changes in the national
welfare system. Due to President
Clinton's intervention, a bill was
recently passed which was a great
deal less harsh as originally
planned by Congressional Repub
licans. The Administration contin
ues to attempt to make changes in
order to guarantee benefits for the
children of legal immigrants. Con
servatives also like to label envi
ronmentalists as bleeding-heart
liberals for their continued struggle
to oppose policies which destroy
the environment in the best inter¬

ests of industry.
Why do I bring up these two
recent examples to prove my
point? I raise these issues to dem
onstrate the irony and stupidity of
such "insults." The majority of
conservatives would like to pre
tend that nothing is wrong with the
environment. They can be pre
sented with an abundance of evi
dence from scientists around the
globe that attests to such problems
as global warming and deforesta
tion. Yet all they can do, with the
backing of a few other minimal
studies, is stick to their contention
that nothing is wrong. When con
fronted with verified statistics
which state that many people, es
pecially children, due to extreme
changes in the welfare system,
could be left on the street when the

byJohnDunlap
Staff Writer It may be just me, but it
seems that First Lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton has disappeared.
We recently saw Mrs. Clinton at
the funeral for the Princesses of
Whales, Diana, but for the most
part, Mrs. Clinton has remained in
exile, an exile that was forced by
the voters in the Republican land
slide of 1994. Not only was elec
tion night 1994 a rebuke of Presi
dent Clinton but was an attack
upon the First Lady herself.
The President and Mrs.
Clinton have always been a team,
that has helped and hurt each of
them. Both are intelligent, ambi
tious people who have worked on
accomplishing a set of goals which
reached their pinnacle with the
President's reelection last year.
However, it was the same Hillary
Rodham Clinton who had to be put
aside for the 1996 Clinton-Gore
campaign.

What I expected did not oc
cur, now that Bill Clinton does not
have to worry about elections or
campaigning, it was my belief that
Mrs. Clinton would take front and
center again. Instead she has
stayed in the shadows picking and
choosing when to stand out. The
Hillary Clinton (Excuse me,
Hillary Rodham Clinton) of today
is like the Hillary Clinton of the
eighties. After Bill Clinton was
elected the youngest governor in
the nation in 1978, in Arkansas, his
wife played a large public and pri
vate role. She did not take his name
and remained simply Hillary
Rodham. That did not play well
in conservative Arkansas. In 1980
because of the Governor's liberal
agenda, lack of leadership, and,
yes, in part liberal wife, Bill
Clinton became the nation's
youngest unemployed governor.

No one has ever been able
to keep Bill Clinton down and in
1982 with his wife's help, he came
back. The former Governor apolo
gized to the voters, promised to
govern from the middle, and
Hillary Rodham added the name
Clinton. He won and the Illinois
native who was now Arkansas's

First Lady worked on helping the
plight of children, a popular cause,
through the Children's Defense
Fund. At the same time, she built
a reputation as one of the best law
yers in the nation with the Rose
Law Firm.
Despite what is reported to
have been bitter marital problems
the Clinton's remained together,
raised their daughter and hit the
campaign trail for the White
House. During the 1992 cam
paign, Mrs. Clinton became an is
sue when she insulted housewives
when she said that she did not want
to stay home and bake cookies but

to get out and do something with
her life.
Both of the Clintons caught
fire when Candidate Bill Clinton
saidby electing him, you "are get
ting two for the price of one with
Hillary." Mrs. Clinton's writings
from college on, where she met her
future husband and President, were
slammed. Her comparisons of
marriage to slavery was hit hard,
and her financial dealings were
under scrutiny by Mr. Clinton's
opponent, former California Gov
ernor Jerry Brown. She would be
attacked at the '92 Republican
National Convention by the Party's
Chairmen Rich Bond and Pat

Buchanan. It was clear in 1992
that this former Young Republican
had become a lightning rod.
Team Clinton won, and the
old Hillary was back. Unlike ev
ery other First Lady, Mrs. Clinton
moved her office from the White
House East Wing to the President's
West Wing. She wanted to be
closer to the power center, and she
clearly was with the announcement
that she would head up the Com
mission on National Health-career
Reform. When the plan was in
troduced, it was clear that the First
Lady was one of the President's
most liberal advisors. The plan
rationed care, took away choice,
and let government takeover one
sixth of the American economy.
Republicans for food reasons ar
dently opposed the plan, and
Democrats ran away from it to save
their political lives. When Mrs.
Clinton by bus traveled the coun
try to rally support for "Socialized

Medicine" the public greeted her
with protest from Seattle to Balti
more. In the end the Administra
tion could not even get the Con
gress to even vote on it.
It was not that the American
people did not just dislike the plan,
the disliked the idea of a co-Presi
dency. Bill, not Hillary Clinton,
had to face the voters. Strong First
Ladies have always been attacked
throughout, not every First spouse
can be a Barbara Bush, perhaps the
most popular woman in America.
Unlike, Hillary Clinton though,
most First Ladies do not come
close if not break the law.
Now at the center of national
attention, Hillary's dark side began
to appear. With the breaking of
Whitewater scandal, the nation
saw how Mrs. Clinton got rich by
skirting with the law.

Journalist James Stewart's
book Blood Sport gave a devastat
ing account of Mrs. Clinton's eth
ics and her trouble telling truth, a
problem that seems to run in the
Clinton family. New York Times
columnist Bill Safire even called
her a, "Congenital liar." Stories of
shredded documents, big money,
and lies associated with Hillary
Rodham Clinton were ironic con
sidering a much younger Hillary
worked to impeach President
Nixon in 1974 over the Watergate
Scandal.

New scandals arose over
Mrs. Clinton's role in the
Travelgate Scandal, for which she
was perhaps the central figure. The
story was basically that the long
time White House Travel Office
was fired and replaced withfriends
of the First Family. The FBI was
abused to attack the head of the
Travel Office. In virtually every
White House scandal, the First
Lady was forced to appear before
a Grand Jury to answer questions
about missing documents appear
ing in the White House's private
quarters.

The people around Mrs.
Clinton have not fared will in the
national spotlight. Her Chief of

I This Side of Cynicism

nual all campus formal is an ex
cellent event, but it could be just
as much fun without hiring some
one to tell them where the balloons
should go.
The budget cut is under
standable; the fact that Senate
passed that cut on to organizations
rather than tightening their own
belt is not.
Senate works, but it could
work more efficiently.
We are fortunate to attend a
private college where there is of
ten enough money to go around,
but thousands of college students
do not enjoy many of the extrava
gances that we have available to
us. We could learn a lesson from
schools where money is not always
taken for granted.

Everyone in every organiza
tion should be mindful of how their
money is spent. After all, it is the
tuition money that we are all pay
ing; money that we and our par
ents have worked hard for and that
should not be squandered mind
lessly. Student organizations that
use their money for worthwhile
causes should not be punished by
Senate.
Student Senate should re
evaluate its budget more seriously
and cut the unnecessary perks and
extras that cost us so much.

us...
Consider this....

"Senate works" has been the
theme of Student Senate for sev
eral years. And over the years Sen
ate has made some positive
changes on campus. The round the
clock service at the library is prob
ably their most famous improve
ment. But how well does Senate
work? Senate's budget for the
1997-98 school year was reduced.
But rather than suck up the differ
ence, Senators passed most of the
the cut on to the many student or
ganizations they support finan
cially. These organizations will feel
the pinch. In some cases they will
be working with budgets under
$ 1,000 for the year. These groups
provide valuable campus pro
gramming and offer a plethora of
opportunities to their students.
Money well spent.

Senate, on the other hand,
uses part of its budget for perks
such as name plates, banners, and
special scholarships open only to
Senators.
Senate also spends money
on projects where they could eas
ily find ways to cut costs.
For example, in the past,
Senate has hired a professional
decorator to transform the ball
room for the Snowball. The an-

Staff Writer
I would like to provide a
brief response to one of the letters
rebutting my last column, pertain
ing to the "Red Zone" before I con
tinue with this essay. It appears
that there may have been a misrep
resentation of my words. If so, I
don't understand because I usually
try to be quite honest and frank
with my language and opinions. I
commend the work of the
Women's Center and other orga
nizations for trying very hard to
end this issue, but my primary
complaint is purely societal, for

which little can be done without a
drastic reversal. If one looks
closely at the title of this column
it is called "This Side of Cynicism"
not "This Side of Solutions". I
suppose that I could think of some
harebrained scheme to change our
culture, but it would be terribly
idealistic and would trivialize the
issue. So then, I view the job of
the press to raise issues (which I
have) and communicate a certain
opinion concerning those issues
(which I did), so that they can be
debated. Simply, by raising a con
cern, one is taking a step toward a
solution to that concern. Mr.

Hirsch, whose assault was appre
ciated, has "no need" for my col
umn, but such a column has caused
him and others to write in offering
solutions and practical advice
about the issue. Thus the pen be
comes a chief instigator of change,
as per history, and is serving its due
purpose for action.
It seems as though the new
concern, which dominated these
pages last week, was the need for
more student involvement in ac
tivities. I believe that involved stu
dents are a very positive attribute

to college life, but we need to be a
bit careful where involvement is
directed on our campus. We must
remember that such involvement
has created a strong, yet gridlocked
bureaucracy, in which most issues
are not adequately addressed or
never brought up to the adminis
tration for debate. We see many
organizations on campus, all with
specific duties and roles, but sel
dom do we see any concrete pro
posals or actions directed toward
the administrative policies with
which we see problems. Now, be
fore you take out your pen and at¬

tack me, realize that I am not
speaking of all organizations, just
those which deal with student is
sues on campus. Call such orga
nizations "Student Leadership" or
"Student Concern" or whatever
you want. It is not necessarily the
fault of those organizations, for
they are only as strong as the stu
dents who use them. My com
plaint is two pronged: first towards
the student body and second to
wards the administration and bu
reaucracy.
Most of the time in college
life the same people serve in lead
ership positions across campus.
Thus we see the same exact people
bearing the burden of involvement
in multiple organizations and com
mittees. We need a more diverse
group of people involved and not
the same people dictating student
policy. Rather than having more
students involved, we need more

diverse students involved. Not
everyone on campus has the time
or the will for involvement in lead
ership. Some people are not prone
to holding positions and others just
hate meetings or are timid in so
cial situations. There is nothing
wrong with such behavior, but we
need not all feel a certain obliga
tion for involvement. Most of
those who are not involved do not
wish to be and could probably care
less, but there are some who do
wish but do not have the opportu
nity. A more diverse student fo
rum for ideas is what is needed.
The organizations which represent
student interests on campus need
to focus a good bit of time to con¬

structive criticism and open debate
over new ideas. Historically, col
leges and universities have been
forums of intellectual debate con
cerning societal or political issues.
Thus, Gettysburg needs to accom
modate such debates and encour
age the spread of diverse thought.
How does the college go about
doing that? Well, if I knew I would
write some legislation or plan a
forum. I suppose the issue of stu
dent involvement is as old as col
leges, but that doesn't mean we can
not work out something to cure the
apathy plague. The people need
to present a voice, and if that voice
is not possible, then what is the
point of student leadership? To
whom are our class officers and
senators representing if not the
people? The student body and

their organizations are useless un
less the administration utilizes their
input and respects their views when
policy is discussed. We have a
plethora of committees, but what
really comes out of such routine
meetings? Maybe (if we are lucky)
a new recycling bin, or in extreme
cases, a new committee is formed
to address the problems of the pre
vious committee. Thus Gettysburg
has formed over the years a very
long bureaucracy which would
make Imperial Russia green with
envy. If a student organization
would propose a policy reform,
what chance would their be of that

policy being accepted? It would
be reviewed and then probably shot
down a year after it was proposed.
For example, last year we had a
long debate over communication
between administrators and stu
dents. What did we see from such
a debate? A few sessions at the
Junction and suggestions at town
meetings which were not taken
very seriously. Is communication
any better now than it was last
year? The answer to my question
might be: "We formed a commit
tee to investigate these issues."
Thus the bureaucracy is expanded
and I am exhausted.

This is an issue for which I
do (for once) have a few construc
tive solutions. Students need to be
aware of the issues concerning their
campus and voice their opinions
accordingly within the student
body. We have all elected officials
whose primary concern is student
welfare and such official need to
be utilized. Seek out your sena
tors, class officers, or organization
leaders. Voice your concerns to
such officials. Come to senate
meetings or talk to a committee
chairperson and let your voice be
known. If you have an interest,

then follow such an interest and
seek out a student organization
which such an interest fits. By do
ing so, we can utilize the existing
student organizations, while be
coming more involved, to accom
modate change, if we utilize the
avenues we have, then their effi
ciency will be demonstrated so that
we do not need multiple investiga
tive committees, or the rest of the
red tape in which we are so deeply
entrenched. We need to show our
concerns and the responsibility to
act according to those concerns so
that something constructive can
actually be done.

The moment we have been
waiting for all year is upon us.
This Saturday will commence the
best Greek Week ever. Check out
the new T-shirts as well as mugs,
which are a new idea for this year
The mugs and T-shirts will be
available in the CUB during Greek
Week, and hopefully, there will be
a deal with the mugs so that you

will be able to get cheap refills in
the Bullet Hole during the week
and during finals week as well.
That is still in the works, so don't
get too hyped about it. We
wouldn't want to disappoint any
one. If you thought the Greeks on
campus only acted silly on the
weekends, are you in for a surprise.

Wednesday, October 1 will be the
much anticipated Greek Olympics
in the heart of campus, Stine Lake.
Greeks, it's time to flex your
muscles in the tug-of-war, peddle
away in the tricycle race, hop along
in the three-legged race and pray
for an antidote for vertigo in the
dizzy bat race. It just might be the
funniest thing you ever see this
side of airbands.

A democrat is a
democrat is a
democrat

economy hits a recessional cycle,
many conservatives just refuse to
discuss that side of the issue and
stick to the issue of welfare abuse.
Well, excuse me for being a bleed
ing-heart liberal, but shouldn't
policymakers and voters have an
open mind to issues such as the
aforementioned ones? If being a
bleeding-heart liberal means car
ing about the environment around
me or caring about the nutritional
and material needs of a poor child,
please continue to label me with
this accusation.
What exactly is a "bleeding
heart liberal" anyway? The term
denotes someone who obviously
has too much sympathy for another
human being. Now, let me get this
straight: this is a bad thing? If so,
I worry about the future of our so
ciety. With regards to those who
label us pejoratively, "bleeding
hearts", I know that the conserva
tive Christian Coalition would
have us believe that Jesus would
also be a conservative. In all seri-

continued from page 12

think the Jesus of the Bible would
say to a hungry child or a destitute
mother? Get off your butt and get
a job? I think not.
In conclusion, I hope we all
someday carry the label "liberal."
We need to have an open mind
to ponder the serious questions that
confront our society in the present
day and age. Hopefully, unlike the
conservatives who simply quote an
accepted party line, (i.e. "Reagan's
economic policies had nothing to
do with the debt of the 80's), vot¬

ers and policymakers will view is
sues from every angle. In a 1939
radio address, President Franklin
D. Roosevelt made the following
quote: "A radical is a man with
both feet firmly planted - in the air;
a conservative is a man with two
perfectly good legs who, however,
has never learned to walk
forward;...a liberal is aman who
uses his legs and his hands at the
behest - at the command - of his
head." So next time someone ac
cuses you of being a "bleeding
heart liberal, say "thank-you."

ousness, though, whether you are
a Christian or not, what do you

Bullets Bucked
by Bison, 17-7

from Staff Reports
Rugby. Many people look
at this sport as a way of making
oneself dumber. A bunch of beer
drinking meatheads running
around chasing a football that was
inflated too much. This is a com
mon misconception of these grid
iron warriors. They fight hard,
play dirty, and don't complain
about twised ankles.
The men's rugby team
kicked off their fall season this
weekend against Bucknell. In the
first half, Gettysburg busted loose
on a quick try by rookie fullback
Shaw Talley. " Shaw played well
for his first game," said Senior
Center Matt Eisenberg, "The team,
in general, looks to have enough
talent for a prosperous season."
After the Bullets "Tally - d"
their first try, they continued to
dominate the trenches. The Bul
lets won almost every scrumdown,
and Hooker Jaime Schmoyer,
booted all the balls back to scrum
half Steve Acuri.

Arcuri was another battler
for the Bullets, and ran wild on the
tricky Bison. Although he ended
up a bit bruised Acuri was
definitley a force for this "never
say die," squad.
In the second half, the Bison
backfield finessed the ball up and
down the field and confused many
of the new starters for the Bullets.

The Bison took control of the field
with their "scissor" play, and took
advantage of the less experienced
Bullets.
The Bullets could not pre
vent Bucknell from scoring twice
in the second half and the match
ended 17-7.
"There are some things that
we still may need to improve on,"
emphasized Eisenberg, "like con
ditioning, and ball control." So, as
the Bullets prepare for some wind
sprints and the ever popular "Four
Corners, " drill, the rest of the
teams on the Bullets schedule had
better beware. With the expert
coaching of Kirby Smith, and the
leadership of Acuri and Eisenberg,
there is definite reason for the foes
of these Bullets to beware.

Bullets squash the "Melon" and win 6-3

Fiom staff reports ,
On Sunday, September
14, the women's tennis team
started their fall season on the right
foot. The Lady Bullets hosted
Carnegie Melon and defeated them
with a team score of 6-3. Two first
year students, Masako Yoshida and
Kay Cofrancesco, both had wins
at numbers one and six, respec
tively. Yoshida smoked Carrie
Mills 7-6(7-5), 6-3, who has been
a finalist in the National Rolex

Tournament for the last two years
and was ranked number three
among Division III. Cofrancesco,
at number six, defeated Whitney
Brooks 6-3, 6-0 in her first colle
giate match.
Also winning for the
Bullets were junior Lesley Kunzier
(#3) and Bev-Freda Jackson (#4).
Tara Schmilt (#2) and Kate
Goodall (#5) were both defeated
by Carnegie Melon opponents
Elizabeth Brown and Julie Balch.
Coach Pfitzinger emphasized the
wins that Gettysburg obtained at

numbers two and three doubles
were ver important to the team's
success. Kunzier and
Cofrancesco, playing at number
two, defeated Watkins and Tuxen

in a tough match with a final score
of 9-7. Also with the same tough
score was the number three team
of Goodall and Jackson, who de
feated Colcha and Cheu. Both of
these matches were very important

for the team to obtain their overall
win. The Lady Bullets will con
tinue to have practice this fall un
til mid-October, and their regulai
season will resume again in the
spring.

Bullets sink "Sho'emen's" shin , roll 5-0

by Marty "Moose" Masar
Contributing writer
The men's soccer team
improved their overall record to 4
3-0 with an impressive 5-0 win
over Washington College last Sat
urday. The team was lead by se
nior captain Greg Stevcic and
sophomore Chris Pryor. Both
players set school records in this
game. On his way to being
named to the Centennial Confer
ence Honor Roll, Stevcic scored
twice, and had two assists to the
lead the scoring for the Bullets.
Greg, who already has the record
for most career goals (37 and
counting), can now add the mosl
career assists in Gettysburg soccer
history to his resume (23) as well.
He broke Scott Stoddard's ('90)
record of 22. Stevcic also has the
most career points with a whop
ping, and he still has twelve games
to play in this, his final, season.

Chris Pryor became the
fifth person in Bullet history to
have three assists in one game. If
he keeps this up, Stevcic's record
will not last very long. Pryor said
of his performance, "In the Mes
siah game we had our problems
scoring, I am just glad that we were
able to put the ball in the net against
Washington, especially, because
they are in our conference."
Though fighting off the
boredom, goalkeeper Jon Katerba
managed to handle all that was put
near him (0 shots) as he recorded
his second shutout of the year (12.5
in his career). A big part of the
shutout was the defense. Katerba
said, "The defense has really been
picking up lately, as well as the rest
of the team. We had our problems
early in the year, but our play has
really picked up and hopefully will
continue for the rest of the season."
Also scoring in the game
was senior midfielder Brian Hull,
and two freshmen midfielders, Bret
Coulson and Geoff Dolan. Fresh¬

men Jim Nastasi also had an assist
late in the game. It seems as
though the Bullets have good stock
for the years to come.
The team's next home
game is this Saturday against Cen
tennial Conference foe,
Muhlenberg at 3:00 pm.
Muhlenberg is currently

ranked #12 in the nation and #2
in the region. This is a key game
to the Bullets' season and hopes
to be nationally ranked. So, come
out, and support these guys in theit
quest for the Centennial Confer
ence. Note: Jumpin' John
Malcolm turned in another spar
kling performance, and cohort Ja
son Vishio also showed off his
fancy feet.

Big Wins for the Bullets.

Lady Bul
lets keep
on Firin'

To none of the Lady Bullets
surprise, the Gettysburg Women's
Soccer team has opened up their
best season in five years. Despite
a 0-3 setback to powerhouse Mary
Washington in their season opener,
the Lady Bullets have pulled off a
string of six straight wins. The
Bullets have knocked off Cortland,
arch-rival Messiah, and they also
took second place (due to point dif
ferential) at the Spalding Cup in
Oneonta, NY by defeating
Oneonta and Hartwick.
In Oneonta, freshman Ryan
Rodriguez earned defensive MVP
honors. The Bullets'great turnout
in this out-of-region tournament
resulted in regional and national
rankings. In the region, the Bul
lets are only behind the College of
New Jersey and Elizabethtown.

by contributing writers

In the opening week of Cen
tennial Conference play, the Lady
Bullets went 2-0. They narrowly
escaped Franklin & Marshall by a
5-3 tally. Their latest battle was
against the Mules of Muhlenburg.
The Lady Bullets showed their re
silience by coming from behind
and pulling off a win in overtime. '
Centennial Conference Player of
the Week, Amy Brewster, slotted
the winning goal only 4:48 into the
overtime period off of a pass from
Shannon Blair. The Bullets are
grateful for Brewster's return af
ter being sidelined for a year due
to an ankle injury.
The Lady Bullets' toughest
tests are yet to come. One of the
most pivotal matches of the sea
son was played here yesterday ver
sus Elizabethtown. The outcome
could change regional rankings.

Despite injuries to three key
players, the Bullets have weath
ered the storm by using their full
roster to win games. Unfortu
nately, Laura Zinck is out for the
season due ' to a knee injury but
Emily Brown and Paula Connard
will return to the field this week.

Sport Spotlight

Advantage Yoshida

by Chesha Miller
StaffWriter Masako Yoshida is the most
talented and experienced player
ever to join Gettysburg's women's
tennis program. The first year stu
dent, from outside of Tokyo, Ja
pan, cannot remember the first
time she held a racket in her hands.
Perhaps her family may have
something to do with that.
Yoshida's father owns the local
tennis center, where she began
practicing every single day at the
age of 12. In addition to that, her
mother, Kazuko Yoshida, is the
only Japanese woman to ever win
Wimbledon. She accomplished
this feat in 1975. Yoshida says her
mother's success did not force a
tennis career on her. In fact, un
der her mother's influence, she de
cided not to play professional ten
nis.

Yoshida had her brush with
the pros during high school when
she toured internationally as a Jun
ior player. Junior players are the
professionals under the age of 18.
Yoshida toured, playing in 13 or
14 different countries during her
school vacations when she was
between the ages of 15 and 17.
She practiced every day on
indoor and outdoor courts. She
was given programs of playing,
running, and weightlifting.
Yoshida did not play tennis her
senior year of high school, as she
felt she needed a break before
playing again at Gettysburg.
During her years touring she
learned to speak English, which
she believes is the language you
need to know to get around in the
world today. Yoshida's coach at
this time was Canadian, and the
only form of communication be
tween the pair could be English.

Yoshida had three different
personal coaches in her career be
fore coming to Gettysburg. Two
of the three were Davis Cup play
ers and the third, a friend of her
mother's, was ranked third in Ja
pan in addition to being interna
tionally ranked.
Yoshida was too busy tour
ing all over the world in high
school to play for her high school
team. She did, however, play for
her team at Gakushuin Girls Jun
ior and Senior High School dur
ing her junior high years. Yoshida
had hoped to attend high school in
the United States, but her parents
thought she would be too far away.

She finally got her wish when she
was applying to colleges.
Yoshida thought that it
would be a great experience for her
to study in the United States, and
an especially wonderful way to
brush up on her English. Yoshida's
first decision was to study on the
east coast, as she wanted a real
taste of American life. She be
lieves that there are a large num
ber of Japanese people living on
the west coast, and she would,
therefore, remain in a form of her
own culture instead of learning
true American culture.
In addition to this, for
Yoshida the most important aspect
of college life is an education. It
was this notion and the campus'
beautiful countryside location that
led Yoshida to Gettysburg. She
visited Gettysburg, as well as some
other small Division III schools
last spring and, as they say, the rest
is history.

So far, Yoshida's career as a
collegiate athlete has gotten off to
a great start. Last weekend, she
defeated the second seeded player
in the Centennial Conference in a
dual meet against Carnegie
Mellon. Yoshida was worried as
to what the outcome of the game
would be, as it was really close
throughout the match, but she
thought, "It was a lot of fun. It is
really great to concentrate on
something competitive. It is a real
way to challenge myself."
Gettysburg Women's tennis
coach Bill Pfitizinger is very proud
of Yoshida's game. "She has a
very, very good all around game,"
said Pfitizinger, "She is a very
mature and intelligent player." The
coach is impressed that she doesn't
get flustered or angry at herself
when she makes mistakes, nor
does she get too excited when she
is playing well.

Pfitizinger is looking for
ward to the Rolex Intercollegiate
tournament to be held at The Col
lege of New Jersey this weekend.
He believes that Yoshida, who is
ranked third in the region, after
only playing one game, has the
ability and talent to win this tour
nament. He also has high hopes
for Yoshida and her doubles part
ner, senior Tara Schmitt.
If the pair, or either one of
them in their singles game, win the
tournament they will advance to
the National Rolex tournament
which will be held in late October.

Speed and grace-Misako Yoshida serves
up some of the best tennis in the country.

Masako has the ability and the
talent to advance to the nationals,"
according to Pfitizinger, "We don't
want to put too much pressure on
her though. I certainly won't be
disappointed in her however she
finishes [this weekend]."
Yoshida is very excited
about the tournament this week
end, but she does not want to think
about it too much. This will be her
first time playing, so she simply

plans to do her best. "I'm a bit
behind since I didn't play all sum
mer, but I will do what I can. It
will be a learning experience," says
Yoshida.
Masako Yoshida is doing
very well for herself at Gettysburg.
She is concentrating on her stud
ies as much as possible. It is a bit
more time consuming and difficult
for her than the average Gettysburg
student, as this is her first time

studying in English.
In addition to her studies and
playing tennis, Yoshida has found
the time to join the International
club and start a Japan Club on cam
pus. Yoshida deserves recogni
tion, not only for her superior ath
letic talent, but also for her dedi
cated determination so far away
from home.

The Gettysburg Bullets foot
ball game this past weekend
against Western Maryland was, in
a word, disappointing. The Green
Terror put on an offensive show
that culminated in a 55-7 win over
our Bullets. Even expert analyst
Chris "Sweet Lou" Lunardi was
speechless about the loss.
The Green Terrors of West
ern Maryland came ready for a war
on Saturday, and battle they did.
The offense, led by Nate DeFreitas
and Mike Sermarini, chalked up
474 yards and scored a total of nine
times including field goals. The
defense held the Bullets to 203
yards and one touchdown.
Although the Bullet offense
was uncharacteristically quiet this
game, Paul Smith still managed to
gather 178 all purpose yards.
Matt Helwig scored the lone
Bullet touchdown on a five yard
run early in the second quarter.
Turnovers hurt the offense
the most, however. The Bullets
lost the ball eight times through
fumbles and interceptions, while

the Green Terrors only gave up the
pigskin once. This turnover ratio
was a key in the Bullet loss.
The defense walked away
from Musselman Stadium a bit
battered as well. Despite the per
formances of Kevin Gurski and
Jason Osborn, with 14 and 10 tack
les respectively, the Bullets just
could not contain Western Mary
land. This week the Bullets are
trying hard, as Derek Reed says,
"To learn from the loss and move
on." This was made a bit tougher
with the losses of Jay Jablonski
and Don McNellis.
However, they are gearing
up to travel to Swarthmore (0-2)
this Saturday at 1:00, undoubtedly
thinking about revenge for the last
game the whole time. And, as we
all know: Paybacks are hell.
In other action : The JV
football team won 27-6 against
Dickinson on Monday. Pete
Devlin, Brian Pojanowski, Jeff
Boyd, and Pat Jordan were all scor
ers for the Bullets. The

ond teamers, were stars on the of-
