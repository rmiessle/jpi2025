News Editor
This week, Gettysburg College's
fraternities and sororities unite to take
part in the various events of Greek
Week, an annual series of activities
sponsored by the Inter Fraternal
Council and Panhellenic Council.
Junior Nicole Hanko (Delta
Gamma), Greek Week co-chair, ex¬

pressed
that "Greek
week is a
way that
all the
Greek or
g a n i z a -
tions can
come to
g e t h e r
and be
more
unified for the
purpose of show
ing the
College
and cam-

corn- The College's annual Greek Week gives fraternities and sororities to participate in a series of
n i t y competitions and philanthrophic events for the purpose of uniting as a community and raising

pus m u

what a money for charity
positive influence we can have."
Co-chair Steve Wyhe (sopho
more, FIJI), added that Greek Week
is designed to "bolster the commu
nity and portray it in a more positive
light than usual, while giving Greeks
a chance to interact with each other,
not just as members of their own fra
ternity or sorority."
Greek Week kicked off on Mon
day with speaker Rick Barnes, who
addressed the Greek community in
Christ Chapel, giving a presentation

on the responsible use of alcohol. This
event was sponsored in part by FIJI.
On Tuesday, CHEERS offered a
program for pledges, including hot
topics skits on drinking and sexual ac
tivity. Later that evening, fi atei nity and
sorority presidents were sold to the
highest bidders during the charity auc
tion, in which Greek leaders donated
their time to raise money foi philan
thropy. This year's auction yielded a

total of $683.
Wednesday's main event was a
faculty forum, where faculty members
met with Greeks to discuss pertinent
issues regarding the College's percep
tion of fraternity and sorority mem
bers. Hanko explained that the Greek
contingent to the forum gathered a lot
of valuable feedback during the session
on how the faculty views Greek life,
and especially on how to mold a more
positive image of it.
Today's main event consists of a
mud volleyball tournament.

Airbands are scheduled for Fri
day, March 3, at 8:00 p.m., in the CUB
Ballroom. Tickets are _^ available for $3;
the proceeds of the event will go to
chanty.
Saturday marks the last day of
this theme week and will feature all
Greek football.
Bed laces, an activity included in
past years, was excluded from this
year's Gieek Week. The reason: un
cooperative weathei conditions.

This is
the first time
that the week
has fallen this
eaily in the
year, says co
chair Wyhe.
"It's usually
in April."
Through
out the week,
each frater
nity and so
lority has
been as
signed points
for winning
various com
petitions as
well as for
their partici
pation in
each event_,
so
sorority with

The fraternity or
the highest total number of points at
the end of the week will be named the
winner of Greek Week and will receive
a monetary award. The champion will
then allocate thus money to benefit its
favorite philanthropic organization.
Greek Week's theme of unity is
intended to promote a closer, more
tightly-knit Greek community within
the general College community, cre
ating a sense of togetherness and en
abling fraternities and sororities to
achieve positive results for charity.

This is an excerpt from
one of many reports by the
Truth and Reconciliation Com
mission (TRC) of South Africa.
It comes from one of the offic¬

ers who tortured and murdered
Champion Galela, an activist in
the banned African National
Congiess (ANC). The TRC was
given the monumental task of
sorring through the violations
of the apartheid era in South
Africa. With the election of
Nelson Mandela in 1994, the
new government felt the need
to come to terms with the past.
Years of apartheid had meant
abductions and killings by the
police as well as bombings,
sabotage and terrorism. Moie
over, it was apparent that the
entire system of apartheid was
itself a violation of human
rights and dignity.

Last Tuesday, Pumla
Gobodo-Madikizela, a clinical
psychologist who served on the
TRC, came to Gettysburg and

Gettysburg graduate named
director of Alumni Relations

From GCPR
Joe Lynch, a 1985 gradu
ate of Gettysburg College, has
been named director of alumni
relations at his alma mater.
Prior to returning to
Gettysburg, Lynch worked for
the ATP Tour - the governing
body for the men's professional
tennis circuit - in Ponte Vedra
Beach, Fl., for more than six
years. While there, he served
as communications manager,
senior communications man
ager, director of media services

and opeutions and director of
communications. He also
served as media directoi for the
Intercollegiate Tennis Associa
tion in Princeton, N.J., and in
formation specialist for the
Metro Atlantic Athletic Confer
ence in Bridgeport, Conn.
As a student at
Gettysburg College, Lynch was
a four-year starter for the Bul
lets varsity basketball team and
earned All-America status in
1983 as a member of the swim

talked about the conflicting
needs to know the truth but
avoid painful memories of the
past. Many families had no idea
what happened to disappeared
relatives or loved ones or had
been told that they had "es
caped" or committed suicide.
The Truth and Reconcili
ation Commission represented
a middle road between
Nuremburg-like trials or blan
ket amnesty to all human rights
violators. In exchange foi ie
vealing the truth of their in
volvement in abuses, applicants
would receive amnesty from
prosecution for their crimes if
they had been politically moti
vated. The TRC's investigation
consideied the time period be¬

tween 1960, when police killed
69 people peacefully protesting
the restrictive Pass Laws in the
Sharpeville massacre, and
1994, when democratic elec
tions brought an end to apait
heid. They received over
20,000 reports. The
Commission's final report
spans several
volumes.Although the TRC
earned the nickname "the
Kleenex Commission" from
some critics because of the
number of witnesses who broke
down during testimony, televi
sion and radio stations brought
the proceedings to the eyes and
ears of the public. It made it
very difficult for anyone to
claim ignorance of their
country's sad legacy.

The Kenan Charitable Trust was established in 1965 by the late
William Rand Kenan, Jr. as a perpetual trust. A chemist,
" '•• " _V _«S _* * '*" ' engineer, and industrialist, William Kenan joined Henry M. Flagler, a

cofounder of the Standard Oil and Florida in his

Company developer,
Florida business enterprises. Shared business and family interests
ultimately resulted in Mr. Kenan and his two surviving sisters inheriting the
major por tion of the Flagler estate.
After Flagler's death, Kenan assumed control of the Flagler financial
empire. Already successful on his own, he became a multi-millionaire with

controlling interest in railroads (including
hotels (including the Breakers), electric
companies, and banking operations. In
Lockport, New York, where he made his

During his later years, Kenan's interests turned to philanthropy. In keeping with his wishes
the focus of the Kenan Trust is on education, primarily at private colleges, universities, and
schools in the United States.
At Gettysburg, the Kenan Trust has moved the College forward in dramatic ways. A
challenge grant of $1.5 million in 1991 helped the College attract substantial new gifts to
increase the endowment in support of academic programs.

Supporting the Orange & Blue

Bv Kristin Roberts
Features Editor
If most athletes think the way I
do, they have probably wondered now
and then where exactly the money to
pay for their uniforms, equipment,
buses for away competitions, and meals
on overnight trips comes from. Ath
letes and non-athletes alike may have
pondered the illusion that certain
teamseem very well endowed, while
others subsist on meager financial por
tions. As a member of a less conspicu
ous and little publicized team whose
obvious, concrete monetary needs ap¬

pear very small, I have been curious as
to the sources and distribution of
Gettysburg College's athletic funds.
As this week the Orange and Blue
Club Phon-a-thon is in full swing, I
thought it would be appropriate to in
vestigate this substantial source of ath
letic financial support. I spoke with
Craig Diehl, the Executive Director of
the Orange and Blue Club, in the hope
that I would not only satisfy my own
curiosity, but also enlighten some other
inquiring mindsDiehl was more than
eager to talk with me, and he disproved
many of my misconceptions about the
athletic department

The Orange and Blue Club began
in the late 1970's as a booster club for
the football team. The booster club
provided money to pay for equipment
and for travel expenses. This distinctly
football-funding organization expanded
in the late 1980's to the official Orange
and Blue Club; this new association at
tended to all existing sports at the Col
lege. Modification came about when
Chuck Winters, our present Athletic
Director, arrived at Gettysburg. At the
same time, Title IX, the legislation that
essentially declares women's sports
equal to men's, was prominent in the
athletic sphere. Winters reformed the
Club, so that its funds became more
evenly distributed among all twenty
four sports teams, both men's and
women's. For a long time, the former
director of the Club, Jack Bream, had
the decision-making power as to how
the money earned by the Club was
spent. Now, however, Winters, in con
junction with the College Public Rela¬

tions, determines how endowments die
distributed and spent. Diehl is respon
sible for creating and directing the
Club's fund-raising programs, as well
as advertising them.
The College has an annual bud
get of which a certain portion is allot
ted to the athletic department. The
budget contains 24 bylines, one for each
sport, which dictate the amount of in
stitutional money bestowed upon each
team. These institutional sums cover
the fundamental expenses of the ath
letic programs, such as uniforms, offi
cials,
and _axxhss 1 k""«>»""«"-"«~-»» «-««-w—*—»

The O & B Club's latest major contribution to Gettysburg
Athletics, a Scoreboard for the field hockey team, can be
seen on Memorial Field, behind Apple Hall.
pholo by Steve

come
from several other sources; the O 6c B
utilizes its finances solely for the ath
letic programs.
Diehl summed up the aim of the O
&C B: "In a nutshell, the O &C B protects
the financial stability of the athletic de
partment as it exists today and seeks to
improve and ensure the competitiveness
of Gettysburg athletics through mon
etary gifts and alumni volunteerism."
The Orange and Blue Club is
funded predominantly by alumni.
That's where the Phon-a-thon is comes
in. Current student-athletes are asked
to work one night a year phoning
alumni and asking for donations. The
contributing alum decides the amount
of money donated, but the callers are
instructed to suggest gifts of specific in
crements. Through the action of the
Phon-a-thon and other charitable gifts,
Gettysburg alumni bequeath 65% of the
total money raised by the Club each
year.

In addition to alumni gifts, the
Club receives significant contributions

from coipoiations In 1990, the O 6c
B Club established an annual golf tour
nament. The tournament, which takes
place in June, is Gettysburg's biggest
one-day fund raising event. Members
of local corporations participate in the
tournament in order to raise money that
goes solely to the athletic department.
Last year, from monetary dona
tions by alumni, corporations, and cur
rent and former parents of athletes, the
Orange and Blue Club collected

$222,000. The Club's goal for
fiscal year (July 1-June 30) is t(

the 2000
increase that
amount t o
$300,000

that go
beyond

the ba
sics paid for by the College. The Club
plays a weighty role in the recruitment
of quality student-ahtletes. They supply
money for recruiting brochures printed
by every team to attract prospective ath
letes. Other types of sport hteiatuie are
included in the O & B budget, as well.
The O &C B also buys the plaques
honoring All-American athletes and the
plaques commemorating former ath
letes inducted into the Hall ot Athletic
Honor. These are all prominently dis
played at various locations m Bream
_Wnght Hausei. Also, O &C B funds buy
the watches presented at the Senior Ath
letic Awards banquet.
One more significant function of
the O tk B Club is its contribution to
the Graduate Assistant program.
Graduate assistants aie former
Gettysburg athletes who return to help
their former coaches with recruiting and
with actual coaching. Many of our
coaches would be unable to cany out
all their duties with out the valuable
_Ct.A'x.

Throughout oui interview, Diehl
assured me several times that the O &C
B's funds are allocated equally among
teams The reason for the misleading
notion that the larger, more recognized
teams acquire greater endowment lies
in the process of alumni giving. Alumni
may donate sport-specific money to
teams of which they have been mem
bers. Teams such as football and field
hockey have more team members each
year, and therefore more alumni,
whereas the smaller Bams, like tennis,
produce fewer graduates. The elder
alumni may also make donations to
teams m recollection of successes expe
lrenced back when they were students;
the teams with longer histories benefit
in that way, as well.
Each year, the O & B Club makes
one especially expensive purchase. For
example, many people may have no
ticed the newly erected Scoreboard on
Memorial Field, the hockey field lo
cated between Masters and Apple. To
purchase this replacement for the old
sign, the field hockey team was allotted
$10,000 last year.

Diehl explained to me the proce
duie for distributing funds among teams
when costly items enter the budget. If
a large purchase is made by the O &C B
Club to benefit one team, then that
team's overall share of the total athletic
budget will be reduced for the year.
Diehl is enthusiastic about his job;
he seems very concerned with the wel
fare of each athletic team at Gettysburg.
Himself a 1995 G'burg graduate, Diehl
is well aware of every team's needs for
essentials, like equipment, and luxuries,
like extia money for dinner at far-away
competitions. He feels our athletes are
"veiy lucky to have the Orange and Blue

Club. Gettysburg is one of the 5 larg
est Division III schools m the nation, in
teims of athletic funding." He adds,
"We have veiy good athletic facilities
compared with most D3 schools."
I must say, I was pleasantly sur
prised, aftei talking with Diehl, how
well the Orange and Blue Club moni
tors the apportioning of athletic funds.
I'll admit 1 was under the impression
that the Club focused on the football
team, but fortunately I was wrong. I've
gained a new appreciation for the ef
forts of Gettysburg's athletic depart
ment: they work hard for their sports
women and men.

Th Although the

For many tutors,
their reward is seeing a
look of accomplishment on
a child's face after he or she
conquers a new word or
reads a difficult sentence.
Getting to know the chil
dren is also a rewarding
experience. After they have
worked hard throughout
the morning there is usu
ally an opportunity to play
a few games; this enjoyable
interaction also improves
the tutors' bonds with the
children.
Last week the activ
ity of choice was a para
chute came, and it was dif¬

ficult to tell whether the
kids or the college students
enjoyed it more. It is ap
parent that all of the tutors
really enjoy working with
the kids and spending time
with them. Many of the
tutois are considering el
ementary education as a
career; some just want to
make a difference in the
lives of these children.
Despite all the moans
and groans about getting
up early on Saturday
mornings, tutoring is a
worthwhile experience for

those who par
ticipate. Some
times it can be
frustrating to
see a child who
has the poten
tial to go far in
life but
stumbles through even

,
tutors cannot
instantly teach children to
read long words and spell
correctly, the impact they
are making is visible in the
faces and attitudes of the
children.
Currently, the atten
dance of children in the
program is not as high as
Coleman's administrators
and Gettysburg students
had hoped. Steps are be
ing taken to make an ef
fort to publicize and at
tract more students to the
program. The benefits of
the Sandtown tutoring
program are shared
equally by both the tutors
and the children.

Lemmel Middle School. We ar
rive at the school at about 10:30
a.m. and greet the students in the
library room. We find the stu
dents whom we have worked
with during past sessions. The
tutors hope that by always work
ing with the same students, we
will establish trusting friend
ships. Every week, program co
ordinator Emily Russin presents
us with creative activities. .Dur
ing the tutoring sessions, the
middle-school students may
bring any homework assign
ments that have challenged them
during the school week. But for
the most part, we help them cre
ate projects that they share with
their peers. To celebrate Black
History Month, we studied
award-winning poet Langston
Hughes' works, and we helped
the students create original po¬

ems. Last week, tutors and their
students thought of interesting
question to ask their classmates.
The girl whom I helped, an
eighth-grader named Temira,
presented her friends with a list
of five male singers and asked
them whom they thought sang
best. After collecting the data,
we compiled it into a colorful
bar graph. Temira enjoyed col
oring the graph, but she felt a
bit nervous about the final aspect
of the project. Each student had

to present his or her findings in
front of the other students. I lis
tened as she rehearsed for me,
and I wished her luck as she gath
ered courage. When her peers
applauded her presentation, she
and I felt very proud.
I first felt interested in the
Sandtown program because I
thought it would provide me
with something challenging to do
each weekend. Pnoi to meeting
Temira, I felt nervous because I
thought that she would not want
to learn. But I soon found that
Temira and the other students
joined the program because they
want to succeed in middle school
and continue their education in
both high school and college.
I feel that the projects that
we complete together give the
students confidence. They come
together each week and support
each other's ideas. They also see
that learning wili lead them to
enjoyable successes.

I respect and admire
Temira. Despite a dismal envi
ronment, Temira seems very
motivated to learn about as many
subjects as possible. She has al
ready taken Standardized
Achievement Tests, and in a year
she will apply for a full-tuition
scholarship to a private high
school in Baltimore.
I hope that our hours to
gether each week encourage her
and help her progress toward her
goals. They certainly provide me
with a valuable experience.

In 1995, the Center tor
Public Sen ice at Gettysburg Col
lege developed the Sandtown Part
nership with the Woodboutne
Foundation in Baltimore, Md.
This 200-year-old Foundation
works to improve the lives and
futures or emotionally and behav
lorallv troubled children and their
families.
CPS and the Woodbourne
Foundation began working to sup
port thiee schools m the
Sandrown area in 1997 Coleman
Elementary School, Lemmel
Middle School, and Douglas High

School. The Woodbourne
Foundation oversees the pro
grams tamed our by CPS and
Gemsburg students so that
the_\ best meet the needs or
the children m the commu
nit\. The kev person in
volved m creating tutoring
programs from the
Gettvslnng end is Kevin Lee,
the Program Coordinator for
the CPS\ Sandtown projects.
He communicates and coor
dinates plans with the princi
pals or the three schools and
with the CEO's of
Woodbourne He also works
closely with _EmiU Russm, a
1996 graduate of Gem sburg

who reaches in the Baltimore
area. _Accoidmg to Lee, the un
derlying objective or these pro
grams is to raise the academic
competencies or the children in
the Sandtown schools Several
disturbing facts about the scho
lastic system stand out, one is that
90 % of these children fail to
meet Maryland's minimum re
quirements on standardized tests.
Another is that the highest late
of student dropout occurs during
the transition from elementary
school to middle school (between
the 5th and 6th grades).
Lee epitomued the pur
pose ot the Sandtown pro|ects
"We design our _mroiint! pio-

i.uns to fosrei good lelarionslnps
etween the kids and then tutors (idc
lly, we do this by ci eating a one-to
ne utio) and to help build then skills
l the areas of literacy, math, and
loup work. We also try to make the
_lograms tun for the kids, since then

If#t|||j

Monday to Friday school can often
be drill-like and unenjoyable."
The following two accounts
shed some light on the goals, the ben
efits, and the experiences ot working
to create a positive environment for
children who badly need one

The original tutoring
program in Sandtown began at
Coleman Elementary School,
where Gettysburg College also
participates in a pen-pal pro
gram. The elementary tutoring
program consists of 31 volun
teers from Gettysburg, and al
most 150 students cooperate in
the pen-pal program.
The students at Coleman
who participate in this Satur
day morning program are gen
erally between third and fifth
grade, and they truly seem to
enjoy the attention and rela-

nonships with Gettysburg
students. The tutoring
program is designed to as
sist the students with read
ing comprehension and
other skills that might need
further development.
This semester, the el
ementary students have
been reading Roald Dahl's
Charlie and the Chocolate
Factory. They have also
learned about biographies
and have written autobio
graphical poems using two
word lines to describe

As Gettysburg College
students, we all know that oiu
dining service is ranked among
the best in the entire nation,
and many of us can appreciate
how lucky we really are. How
ever, sometimes a meal pur
chased using the imaginary
meal ticket engrained in a mag
netic strip on the back of our
ID cards just doesn't cut it. At
these times, we like to use the
imaginary emergency money
engrained in the magnetic strip
on the back of our credit cards.
That is why I will be
reviewing different restaurants
in the Gettysburg aiea. Hope¬

fully I can help Gettysburgian
readers sort thiough the mynad
of dining options oui commu
nity presents. I am here to sac
rifice my waistline for you, and
it is my privilege to do so.
This week the eatery that
I have chosen to review is
Hoss's Steak and Sea House,
located on Rt. 30 East next to
Wal-Mart. Hoss's is a chain of
family restaurants familial to
many throughout Pennsylvania
and parts of Maiyland and
West Viiginia. This style of
restaurant does not appeal to
everyone, nor is it maiketed to
appeal to everyone.

Noted eaterv patioi
Daniel Jewett, a.k.a. "Pneumo
nia Jew," remarked, "Any eat
ing patron Daniel Jewett, a.k.j
"Pneumonia Jew," remaiked
"Any eating establishment tha
has a sign saying 'Only a Tei

Mmute Wait horn Here,' as
you walk in, is not my kind
of restaurant." However,
for those of us seeking an
affordable steak, Hoss's is a
viable option. You will not
find a creamy Bainaise
drizzled ovei youi filet mi
gnon, but you will find a
choice cut of beef piepaied
to your liking.
Hoss's is a casual les
taurant with an extremely
relaxed atmospheie. From
the tin signs of yesteiyear
adorning the walls to the
mason jars covering the light
bulbs in the overhead lamps,

Hoss's exudes a rustic charm
that is meant to make the
customei feel at home
Most impoitantly, though,
they have beef, and Hoss's
does that veiy well
Hoss's has a fine selec
tion of steaks, as well as
chicken, poik, ham, and sea
food it one is not a fan of
red meat. Upon walking
down the long entiance coi
ndoi one is _gieeted by two
laige menu _boaids listing a
wide vanetv of appeti/ing
(.linnet options. Unlike most
restamants, at Hoss's one
ordeis then meal betoie they
are seared.

After oi dei ing a
hiendly membei of the
Hoss's wait staff will guide
you to your seat, and leave
you fiee to commence eat
ing. All meals include un¬

limited trips to Hoss's extensive
Hosspitahty bar. Salad, soup,
breads, desserts (including pud
ding), are all there for the taking.
After finishing youi salad, at least
the first round, it is time for your
meal to appear
For the sake-of this column

and two of the establishments sea

Dear Libby,
Please consider a bath

_J Dear Erin,
• Libby shares your frus
• tration because when she is
• studying on the fourth floor
• and has just finished off her
_, second or third drink (in a
• covered container of course)
• she wishes there was a
restroom in the vicinity.
• Unfortunately the fel
• low who designed the build
ing (the very same one who
• didn't think library users re
• quired heat in the little study
° bays, or a normal sized el
• evator, adequate lights in the

s same gentleman with an iron
• bladder, who didn't think it
• was necessary to put
_, restrooms on each floor.
• Unfortunately there is no
• plumbing in the upper floors
_• and installing restrooms
• would cost a fortune.

• On top of that we don't
_J even have room for all the
• books and journals, so we're
• hoping you and your friends
_• can hike down the two
• flights and visit the limited,
_• but well appointed restroom
• facilities, on the second or
• ground floors. Sorry we
1 can't be more helpful on this

" one. Dear Libby,
• Can you please make
• people stop using the red
• phones for extended conver
• sations. Or rip them out.
• The quiet floors are for
• studying. Annoyed
a Dear Annoyed,
• Libby has addressed
• this question at least two
_• times this year. These

phones are for security.
Apparently these inconsid
erate yackers can't read.
So once more, for the
record: The red phones are
for an emergency. Get it?
Unless you see a fire, or you,
yourself are on fire, or
somebody is attacking you,
don't you dare to even think
about picking up the red
phones to arrange your so
cial calendar. You are dis
turbing the people around
you. Here's an idea. You
know how Ann Landers
tells her readers to cut out
her columns and paste them
on the refrigerator door?
Well, maybe you can cut out
this Libby column and hang
it by the emergency phones
so these big mouths will see
it and shut up already. It is
worth a try.

Dear Libby,
I think the periodical
The Utne Reader would be
a valuable addition to the
library's collection. I was
surprised to find that it isn't
currently subscribed to. Is
there any particular reason?
Thank you, Erin
Dear Erin,
Are you the same Erin
of the limited restroom
complaint? If so, Libby can
give you happy news on this
request. We do subscribe to
the Utne Reader. You will
find it alphabetically under
U on the ground floor. Back
issues in the stacks are at
PN4784.U53. Even though
the Utne Reader has been
published since 1984, the
library only started sub
scribing in 1999.

Second call for your
bottom line: Libby is look
ing for a few good behinds.
Put your posterior into
action. Libby is testing out
some replacement
furniture in the library

and you can help.
Vote with your seat.
Come try out the possibilities
for new lounge
furniture and desk
chairs. (And yes we'll also be
replacing the tables and
carrels eventually.)
Bring your behind to the new
books area, across from
the circulation desk, and

_oulered my meat medium-raie, cooked through, yet warm
and pink in the middle. This is the most difficult way to
prepaie any cut of beef, and _tequires a chef with a good
deal of skill, especially with a relatively thin cut of beef.
My steak certainly qualified as a thin cut of beef, but the
middle was still warm and pink, piecisely the way I had
ordered it.
I then pioceeded to take that first wonderful bite of
beef, and my palate was greeted by a flavorful cut of beef,
with a hint of a light Worcestershire marinade.
I then turned my attention to the fried clams. Having
originally been born in Massachusetts, fried clams are one
of my favorite foods. I have also found it very difficult to
find good fried clams outside of the New England region.
The texture and taste of good, fresh fried clams is some
thing that is nearly impossible to explain; yet once you have

had the best, all others pale in comparison. I am sorry to
say that the clams I sampled at Hoss's were not of the qual
ity that I have come to expect. The tartar sauce that I was
served with the clams was adequate for the meal, but noth
ing truly special.
The langastinos were not as fresh as one may like,
but we are too far from the ocean to hold Hoss's account
able. I was impressed with how the langastinos were pre
pared. I had a choice of having my langastinos fried, broiled,
or scampied. I chose the scampi since it is more difficult to
prepare. I must say, I am a big fan of almost any seafood
prepared in a scampi and have had many scampies through
out my life. The scampi at Hoss's is excellent. It has the
right amount of garlic without being too overpowering. I
actually had to get more of Hoss's fresh bread so that I
could soak up the remaining scampi butter.

One of Hoss's strongest points is its Hosspitality Bar.
The salad bar is extensive and extremely fresh. There is
always a selection of three or more homemade breads, as
well as a nacho bar. Also, Hoss's has two or three soups
each day, and a different featured soup for every day of the
week. There is also a desert bar with cookies, brownies,
souffls, pudding, fresh fruit, frozen yogurt with sundae top
pings, and more. The Hosspitality Bar has many items to
offer every customer perfect accompaniments to their meal.
Many also order the Hosspitality Bar as a meal in itself.
All in all Hoss's is a fine dining experience for those
seeking a moderately priced meal. The average price of a
meal, including a beverage, and a cup of coffee, is roughly
fourteen dollars. This is a price that most students can
easily afford every once in a while. And in my opinion,
Hoss's is well worth the cost.

UPINION
Letter to the Editor

Liberal feminist
strikes back at
radical remarks
I am writing this letter in
response to Mr. Stephen
Cassanno's letter that appeared
in last week's Gettysburgian.
Mr. Cassarmo wrote in re
sponse to my column "Women
Should Not Fear Feminism,"
that appeared in the February
17 edition of The Gettysburg
ian. I read Mr. Cassanno's let
ter seriously, as I would to any
critique of my work. After I
was finished, I went back and
reread my column from the
previous week.

I think that he was right
with his first point— I should
not have written that I expect
derogatory remarks from all
men—just some men. I should
not have placed all men into
one group. It may have seemed
that I was judging others by
their gender, but that was to
tally unintentional. I also be
lieve that men can be feminists.
I never said that men could not
be, and actually, I am a very
strong supporter of the theory.
The sad fact is that there are
not a lot of men like Mr.
Cassarino who are willing to
admit they are feminists.

In addition, I purposely
addressed my column to
women. Like other opinion
columns that have run in this
paper, my column addressed a
certain audience. The week of
February 17, it just happened
to be women. As for my "bla
tant disregard" for equality, I
completely disagree with Mr.
Cassarino's opinion. I do not
believe that my column was
addressing the issue of gender
equality, it was promoting femi
nism in one form or another.
As for the different forms
of feminism, Mr. Cassarino
seems to be confused in that de
partment. He states that
"many people consider" me "to
be a radical feminist." Well, I
suggest that both Mr. Cassarino
and those other people all take
a class on the different forms

of feminism— like radical, lib
eral, and conservative feminism
(the list does not end there). If
he had made an educated guess
at what a radical feminist is, he
would know that I am not one.
Radical feminists are mostly
concerned with violence
against women. They do not
really trust men, because they
see men as possible threats
against their physical well-be
ing. They also go so far as to
blame men for women's op
pression within society. They
also are concerned with women
being seen as simply mindless
bodies that were put on earth
to do tend to domestic things
without any opinions. Also,
they are concerned with the
protection of lesbianism.
Instead of being incor
rectly labelled a radical femi
nist by the highly misinformed
Mr, Cassarino, I would like to

set the record straight by say
ing that I am a liberal feminist.
Liberal feminists, like myself,
are concerned with issues like
human rights, equality between
the sexes, and economic issues
concerning women. Liberal
feminists believe that the un
equal treatment of women has
not come from men as indi
viduals (like radical feminists
would believe), but instead
from institutions. Liberal femi
nists also believe that women
should be seen as equal to men.
Even though Mr.
Cassarino believes that I am
"fighting a war that has already

been won," I disagree. Women
in the year 2000 may be more
equal to men than in the year
1900, and most probably even
1999, but we are still not fully
equal. Mr. Cassarino says that
women like me should stop
feeling badly for myself, but I
don't think he understands
what I am saying. I do not feel
badly for myself. I am not sit
ting in a corner thinking that
women will never be equal to
men. Instead, I am taking ad
vantage of the situation that I
am in, and informing others
that while things are better for
women, much MUCH better

than in previous generations,
things can still get better for

women.
I am not looking at |ust
women in the United States,
where there is no question that
women are treated very well; I
am also concerned about the
well being of women all around
the globe, from women who
are beaten for going out in pub
lic without covering their heads
in the Middle East to 12 and
13 year old girls who are sold
into prostitution to relieve fam
ily debts in Southeast Asia to
girls who never get to become
women because of the immense
amount of female infanticide in
developing nations around the
world.
Even in North America,
women are looked down upon.
In 1989, a lone gunman walked
into a classroom at a Canadian
university. After requesting all
the men to leave, he shot and
killed the women that were in
the class because he was bitter
that he had not been accepted
to the engineering school and
these women had.

Things like this happen
when people seem to get a dis
torted view of feminism, espe
cially "radical" feminism. To
bring things closer to home,
there are women on this cam
pus who have male advisors
who have discouraged them
from seeking any higher edu
cation and suggesting that they
resign themselves to domestic
life. There are women who will
not speak up in a classroom
setting because their male
counterparts have discouraged
them from doing so, either di
rectly with a comment, or in
directly, by snickering at them.
So, until all evidence of
this discrimination against
women is gone, Mr. Cassarino,
do not be so condescending as
to suggest that my "war" is
over. The fight for women's
rights is far from over.

As for the statement that
says that I am not pro-woman,
but instead anti-man, I would
have to strongly disagree with
Mr. Cassarino again. Some

people feel that being pro
woman and anti-man go hand
m hand— you can't have one
without the othei. I disagree.
If I were so anti-man, how
could I possibly get along at a
coed school? Howcanlwoik
well with men in the classroom
and in other activities that I am
involved with? How can I say
that in the group of people that
I hold in high esteem and see
as role models, a good percent
age of them are men? How
could I trust my academic ad
visors (who are both male) and
trust the advice they have given
to me? How could I even have
friends that are men? If I hated
men so much, then I would
hate all the men that I love, in
cluding some of my closest rela
tives. Don't make such judge
ments, Mr. Cassarino. Blatant
personal attacks with no facts
to back them up have never
done any good to anyone.

And as for the patroniz
ing tone that Mr. Cassarino
claims to have detected in my
column, I do not detect it any
where. Mr. Cassarino seems to
have discerned innuendos
where there were none. He
states that I see my female
counterparts at this college as
"stupid." If anything, it is he
who thinks that he can manipu
late them by writing such a re
sponse to my column. As for
my "putting down of another
woman for ... her choice to
be a stay at home mom," Mr.
Cassarino obviously did not
finish reading the paragraph, or
chose to ignore my statement
stating that I have no problem
with being a stay at home
mother. In fact, my mother was
a stay at home mom for the first
eight years of my life. I think
that it is a very noble thing for
someone to do. My point was
to make your own decision, but
to not prevent other women
from having a job by taking
away daycare.

He also claimed that I
was trying to "win . . . people
over to the feminist cause." If
Mr. Cassarmo had taken the
time to carefully read my ar¬

ticle, he would know that I did
ask women to find the kind of
feminism they are comfortable
with. I did not try to "convert"
anyone over to liberal femi
nism. I would like women to
be more informed about femi
nism, and all its different vari
eties. I encourage everyone—
men and women— to read a
book, take a class, just get in
formed about the various typed
of feminism. Do not stay ig
norant to such an important
political facet in the United
States and around the world.
If anyone's thoughts were
"confused and bigoted," it was
Mr. Cassarino's in his letter.
He took my words and twisted
them to use as he wanted to.
And, as he claimed that many
people complemented him for
standing up to "illogical"

people like myself, I had many
people— students, administra
tors, and support staff— ap
proach me in the same fashion
and criticize Mr. Cassarino's
distortion of my words.
So, Mr. Cassarino, I
would like to thank you. First
of all, thank you for making my
column the focus of the cam
pus for the past two weeks.
Thank you for the free public
ity that you have so generously
given me. Thank you for mak
ing people want to read what I
write. I now know that many
people will be reading my
words more carefully next
time. Also, I would like to chal
lenge you to write your own
column. It is much easier to sit
back and rip apart another
person's ideas; it is much
harder to come up with your

own. Sincerely,

Environmental plan
could redeem Clinton
President Clinton has not had the
presidency that he dreamed of, nor one
the American people may be proud of.
His latest years have been wrought with
scandal and unfinished or shaky inter
national business and negotiations. But
there is still some hope for tins man.
With only a few months left in his final
term, President Clinton is looking to
make a lasting impression on the future,
to create a new legacy by doing the most
practical and noble thing he could pos
sibly do: protect America's wild forests.
The President has announced his

Wild Forest Protection Plan (also known
as the President's Roadless Initiative)
which would protect 60 million acres
of pristine wilderness. These acres are
public lands set aside by the government
over the years for the American people.
The lands are protected in National
Forests, but can still be invaded by ex
tractive industries, off-road vehicles,
and the construction of roads. Keep
ing these invasions, especially roads, out
of natural places will prevent further
degradation of America's last wild
places and prevent the severing of habi
tat for grizzlies, salmon, wolves, and
other threatened wildlife.

This initiative could be the great
est piece of environmental legislature
since 1980, and has the potential to
keep millions of acres in their natural
state for eternity. Please support the
President in this bold move to protect
more land across the nation than ever
before. You can email the President
from the following website: Imp://
www.whitehouse.gov/WH/Mail/html/
Mail_President.html Your comments
will help protect America's wild lands
indefinitely.

The bubble is thick,
but we can look
through it
It is often said that we live in a
bubble at Gettysburg College. Two
years ago, this comment did not bother
me. Leaving the safety net of my small,
affluent Long Island hometown, I felt
safe knowing that Gettysburg College
was not quite reality. I took comfort in
the thought of being shielded from the
real world for another four years.
I did not realize, however, that the
bubble would be so dense. Many would
argue that all colleges are bubbles.
There is no other time jn our lives when
our biggest concerns will be papers,
laundry, and who hooked up with
whom on Saturday night. So, perhaps,
we are not alone.
Every now and again, however, a
comment strikes me in such a way that
I know that our bubble is too protec
tive. "My parents send me 50 bucks a
week, so that covers my pot."

"The first thing I did when I got
here was hook up my computer and go
to www.jcrew.com. Thank God, it still
worked."
"I drove drunk and crashed my
Jeep Wrangler last summer, so my par
ents got me a Jeep Grand Cherokee in
stead."
How about this one offered in a
debate about helping the poor or the
discriminated against? "If they want to
get anywhere, then they have to get off
their butts and do something about it.
Most of them are just lazy; if they
worked hard, they could get to the top,
too." Aie the people who go to Gettys
burg College so sheltered that they do
not undeistand that the poor are not
given the same rights as the wealthy?
Do they not understand that the poor

Steps must be taken to ensure that future generations grow up
safely, recognizing that our right to bear arms is not a default but a
product of a society responsible enough to understand the dan
ger that firearms can pose.

a firearm: self-defense and hunting. There
are many people who feel safer in a house
that has a gun, just in case armed robbery
was attempted while someone was home.
That is not an unreasonable viewpoint, but I
question whether the majority of people who
keep a gun are trained adequately enough
to use it when it matters. If someone breaks
into your house, having a gun doesn't mean
automatic safety: you have to get the
weapon, load it, confront the intruders and
hope they don't outnumber you. There are
many variables in such a situation.
It's important to remember, however,
that a person has to pull the trigger. There
are some people who, for whatever reason,
are mentally unstable and are a significant
liability to society when given a firearm. Since
we can't single out individual people's rights,
we either need eliminate the right to carry
firearms (a precedent I wouldn't be willing to
take) or institute much better control over
public access to weapons.

More extensive background checks
longer waiting periods and home gun stor
age safety laws are a start. No one needs a
gun immediately; owning a firearm is a right
and all rights carry responsibilities.
In fifty years, will we still have the same
problems with guns? Will school shootings

Horrible practice

by Rachel Hanson
Columnist
While thinking about
possible topics to discuss in my
column this week, female geni
tal mutilation (FGM) came to
mind as a possibility. However,
I had serious reservations about
writing about FGM because I
get physically ill just thinking
about it, never mind reading up
on it and then writing about it.
I then realized that I have a re
sponsibility to make as many
people as possible aware of this
heinous practice that absolutely
must be put to an end.
Female genital mutilation
is practiced mainly in Africa
and the Middle East, though it
also occurs in immigrant com
munities all over the world.
FGM most often occurs on
girls between the ages of four
and eight and approximately
6,000 girls are mutilated every
day. Currently, there are 135
million girls and women who
have undergone FGM.

FGM ranges from cuts
around the clitoris, which is
rarely performed, to the more
common practice of infibula
tion. During infibujation, the

but then you become "that
guy" who lives with his patents
and knows every high school
chick on a first name basis even
though he is thirty-five. Not
the type of life 1 would recom
mend, but at least for you I
hope that your parents live in
a state with loose laws concern
ing such things.
To be perfectly honest, I
hated this place to begin with,
and even after spending more
time here, my own personal
negativity got to me and my
transfer applications were sent
out. I suppose my greatest criti
cism was moie social than aca
demic, and it took me a while
to find my own place in this
small campus community. I
never was one for loud music

entire clitoris, and sometimes
the labia minora or the labia
majora (or both) are removed
as well.
The girls are cut with lit
erally anything—broken glass,
tin lids, scissors and razor
blades. The procedures are far
from sanitary and anesthetics
are almost never used. Often
girls are told to sit in cold wa
ter to make the area numb be
fore FGM is carried out. Fol
lowing FGM, the girls are sewn
up with either thorns or
stitches, and their legs may be
bound together for as long as
40 days. Infibulation leaves an

opening no larger than the
head of a match.
The physical side effects
of FGM are quite extensive.
During FGM, shock, hemor
rhaging and damage to organs
surrounding the clitoris can
occur. Also, the samt cutting
instrument is often used on
numerous girls, leading to the
spread of HIV. The openings
left are insufficient for urine or
menstrual blood to pass
through, which leads to
blocked urination and painful
periods. Other complications
include chronic infections,
painful or impossible sexual

or dancing, and, for some rea
son, warm Natural Light in a
can doesn't suit my palate.
Being a first-year in the fall of
1996, except for a few events
brought to us by SAC, there
wasn't all that much to do on
the weekends and I didn't like
fraternity houses all that much.
It just never was really my
thing. It seemed as though I
made a poor choice in coming
here. Even when my social op
tions became broader, Gettys
burg College seemed way too
limited, and less diverse than 1
wanted, and all of the usual
complaints that fill the file of
transfer students. Rather than
trying to help the problem, I
decided to bitch and moan

intercourse, infertility, and rup
tures into the urethra or rec
tum during intercourse. Often,
women need to be cut before
they can have sexual inter
course. Also, because scar tis
sue is not as flexible as regular
tissue, childbirth can become
dangerous and many times re
sults in the death of both
women and babies.
I am sure that many aie
asking why such a terrible and
medically unnecessary proce
dure occurs. FGM has actually
been carried out for several
thousand years. Reasons cited
for FGM include marital fidel
ity, controlling the woman's sex
drive, preventing lesbianism,
"calming" her personality, and
hygiene. In many of these cul
tures, women are not supposed
to enjoy sex, and the removal
of the clitoris will ensure this.
FGM is also done in some cul
tures to enhance men's sexual
pleasure.

Many also feel that FGM
is necessary to make their
daughters healthy and because
they fear that if they do not
"circumcise" the girls, their
genitals will grow until they
hang down between their legs,
and some actually believe that

about how desperately unin
spired I was and how I felt suf
focated. Although these feel
ings were completely genuine,
with some good advice I real
ized that a social reason al
though valid for some, was no
reason for my transfer. Al
though the pettiness, vagrant
materialism and apathy of
many of our fine peers annoyed
me, it was no reason for me to
leave. Thus I stayed and I have
tried, since I made that deci
sion, to at least have some soit
of impact (positive or negative)
on our sunoundings. I knew
that as long as admissions kept
up the fine standards of the
"Gettysburg" look that not a
whole lot was going to change.

they may eventually drag on
the ground. Some also view the
clitoris and labia as "male
parts" of a woman's body,
which therefore need to be re
moved to make them more
feminine.
The importance of soci
etal pressures must not be for
gotten when discussing "lea
sons" for FGM to occui. In
many cultures, women who
have not undergone FGM are
unmarnageable, oi at the very
least, "circumcised" brides will
yield a higher price when mar
ried. It is also felt in some so
cieties that if a man should
touch the clitoris during sex or
if a baby should come in con
tact with the clitoris during
childbirth, he could die as a
result. Finally, in some societ
ies, women who are
unmutilated are seen as being
unclean and are even forbidden
to handle food of water.

While there are no statis
tics that show how prominent
FGM is m the United States, it
is clear that it is being practiced
in many immigrant communi
ties. A number of doctors have
been asked to perform FGM,

People were angered years ago
when the Princeton review
came down on the College for
being too homogeneous, but
who can really blame them?
When the Review called us a
J.Crew catalogue it wasn't all
that far from the truth, and
when they exposed the fact that
we have some of the worse
town/gown relations in the
country it was no fallacy.
So I was bitter, and argu
ably still am, but not for the
same reasons as before. This
whole experience has taught
me that people are people,
whether in London or in Get¬

tysburg, and there will be those
petty conversations in the CUB
or Uni Pub or wherever you go.
Rather than becoming broader,
more diverse, or exposed to
different ideas and people, I
have become more tolerant and
patient - two virtues with which
I will always struggle. Still
though, this whole experience
which seemed so stagnant has
become for me, at least a way
to learn and grow as a human
being. I figured our that while
most won't listen, a few will,
and those are the people who
will raise the standards of this
fine institution in the future.

I suppose that this messy
glob of rambling makes little
sense to most of you. In many
ways I am confused by my own
nostalgia as I try desperately to
piece together these last few
months. It is hard to realize
where this time has gone, even
though I detest that cliche be
cause we all know it has gone
down my throat, washed away
like a nicely chilled Bombay.
There is so much really to ab
sorb - from the leadership and
social skills I have learned, to
how to make the perfect Savoy
Martini. Needless to say, I
don't regret wanting to trans
fer oi questioning my place
here because without asking
myself those important ques
tions, I would have been lost
amongst the masses of
Abercrombie with nothing to
do but complain. Well, maybe
I haven't learned all that much.

When I was in tenth
grade, a classmate of mine
brought a gun to school and hid
it in a gym locker. When the
gym teacher found out, he
brought the young man to the
disciplinary office, where they
found that the student had been
the target of some ridiculing
during the gym period the day
before and he just brought the
gun to school to scare a few
people. The teachers thought
nothing of it. They suspended
the boy for a week, and two
years later, he walked across the
same stage that I did and re¬

ceived his high school diploma
with our class. He was a gifted
artist, and actually painted a
beautiful banner that my high
school hung inside the main
rotunda where it still hangs
there today. By the time we
graduated, it seemed as though
that angry young man who
brought the gun to school had
changed. But that incident
never left the minds of the
other students who were in
school that day.
Fast forward five years
into the future. If that incident
were to happen today, that
young man would most prob
ably have been expelled from

ever, any good biologist could
tell you that the fetus is actu
ally a separate being that feeds
off the mother through the pla
centa. I also remind the read
ers that many groups in the past
have tried to justify the killing
of others by claiming them not
to be human. Nazis said that
Jews are less than human and
the Ku Klux Klan often tried
to make blacks out as not-hu
man, so, how is the pro-choice
argument any different? It is
nor. This brings me to my next
point: the term "pro-choice".
I have only used it to this point
because it is more familiar for

school, and charged with some
kind of crime. It is sad to say
that even though I have been
out of high school for only
three years now, the experience
of high school students in 2000
is much different than the one
that I experienced in the mid
1990s. Students coming into
schools have to wonder if one
of their classmates is carrying
a gun. Words like "school
shootings" and "Trench Coat
Mafia" have invaded the
thoughts of the nation. Last
spring's images of the atrocity
at Columbine High School re
pulsed the nation. Who would
ever think that two boys— not

even old enough to buy ciga
rettes— could plan and carry
out the calculated killings of
twelve of their classmates, a
brave teacher, and then com
mit suicide? The siege that oc
curred in Columbine did not
only affect those who were in
nocently murdered, but rippled
outward, affecting the families,
the school's surviving students,
the community, the nation, and
the world. The disgusting
thought that anyone could just
walk into a gun show, buy the
weapons and hand them over
to their "friends" to mercilessly
kill others is beyond many
people.
On Tuesday, a six year old

Cassarino

the readers, but from now on I
will use the term "anti-life". I
do this because I do not think
"pro-choice" accurately de
scribes the real views of these
people. Libertarians are "pro
choice", liberals are not. They
are not pro-choice because they
only believe in the woman's
choice in this particular matter
while on many other issues they
believe the government has the
right to tell them what to do.
For example, many anti-life
people support gun control;
they believe the government
can tell you what guns you can
and cannot own. They also
oppose school voucher pro
grams, which would give par
ents the right to choose which

boy walked into his first grade
classroom outside of Flint
Michigan and killed one of his
classmates, a six year old girl.
Because the boy is only six, he
will not be facing any charges
for the murder of his classmate.
According to a country pros
ecutor, they do not believe that
the boy had any criminal intent.
Instead, the person who "sup
plied" the stolen weapon to the
boy could be facing manslaugh
ter charges, and the boy's
mother could be charged with
neglect. And what about the

boy? No, I'm not suggesting
that we throw him in jail. I
suggest that we start figuring
out what is wrong with him,
why he felt he had to bring a
gun to school, why he thought
that it would be okay to shoot
at another student. I believe
that, as a nation, we have to
stand back and look at what
society has become. Why are
children killing other children?
Why are guns made so readily
available to them? Why do
children feel that they can't
work out their problems in a
less deadly matter '

I am not going to waste
space by criticizing the NRA or
those who hide behind the Sec
ond Amendment. What I am
suggesting is that we look at the
root of this problem. Should

school to send their children to.
Thus, it seems they subscribe to
the belief that it is just fine for
the government to tell them
where to send their progeny to
school, but it is not in their
place to keep them from kill
ing their young.
The arguments against
both affirmative action and
abortion are overwhelming.
The fact is, Ms. Hanson and
Ms. Dickert probably know
that they are wrong or they
would not have to lie about it
so much. If the facts were on
their side they could tell the
truth. The problem is th.it
people are naturally stubborn
and do not like to admit their
mistakes. However, it is vital

there be child locks on guns
Should new technology be de
veloped to stop other people
from using a gun that belongs
to another? I believe so. If we
do not start looking at this
problem of children killing
children now, how big will this
problem be in another five
years? I understand that people
use guns for other things, like
hunting, and I think that it
would be impractical of me to
suggest a ban on guns. But I
do think that it is imperative
that we as a nation start put
ting up road blocks to the ac
cess of guns.
I like Ptesident Clinton's
suggestion of requiring gun li¬

censes. You have to register to
vote, why not register to use a
gun? This would not be im
peding on Second Amendment
rights— it seems like common
sense to me. I think that we
need to start talking to our chil
dren and finding out what
kinds of anger they are hiding
and stop the problem before it
begins. I believe that the com
bination of some kind of gun
control and attention given to
our children would start this
process of rehabilitation that
our country needs after the
numerous school shootings
that have occurred in just the
past three years. Our children
deserve better, do they not?

for rhe well being of this soci
ety for people to admit they are
wrong when their incorrect
beliefs help keep policies in
place that perpetuate racism
and lead to the slaughter of in
nocent lives. In conclusion, I
expect that neither Ms. Dickert
nor Ms. Hanson will change
their positions since that would
entail them revealing the flaws
in their beliefs. And for them,
disclosing the fault in their
views would be tantamount to
acknowledging their racism or
owning up to murder, and no
body wants to do that.

FGM

- continued from page 12 -
and some actually do. Women
have asked obstetricians to
reinfibulate them after child
birth because it is the custom
and the women fear retribution
from their husbands if it is not
done. A number of states have
passed laws making FGM ille
gal, including Minnesota,
North Dakota, Tennessee and
Delaware. Similar bills have
been introduced in other states,
though some have not been

nearly as successful.
In Rhode Island, State
Representative Ellen Kellner
introduced a bill that would
criminalize FGM. The chair of
the House Judiciary Commit
tee, Charles Knowles, failed to
see the importance of such a
bill. He said that Kellner was
"trivializing the [judicial] pro
cess by submitting a meaning
less, pointless piece of legisla
tion." He went on to say that
the number of the bill, House
Bill 7769, was "fitting, consid
ering the subject."

Many have said that
FGM is just as bad as the very
common practice of male cir
cumcision and that the cultural
practices of other people
should not be controlled ac
cording to American standards.
However, in actuality, the onlv
male equivalent to even the
least severe form of FGM
would be "the complete cutting
off of the entire head_^of the
penis." Surely if this were he
ing practiced as widely as
FGM, there would be an even
larger outcry and which would
put it to an end very quickly.
In order for female geni
tal mutilation to be stopped,
everyone needs to learn about
and speak out against if, even
those who are not affected by
it and never will be. Education
is rhe most important step to
ending this horrible and unnec
essary practice.

through trade and "construc
tive engagement" relations
would be smoothed over. This
in turn has led to a disaster foi
US foreign policy, with China
becoming more and more as
sertive and aggressive and with

the Clinton Administration
clinging harder and harder to
its policy, as though trying to
prop-up this communist state
Before getting into the
details of the failure of
Clinton's China Policy, it is nec
essary to discuss the historical
and common sense flaws in the
policy. These two flaws are, in
fact, exactly the same: govern
ments that rule during good
economic times are more stable
and secure than bad ones. This
is just plain common sense,
which is why the Clinton ad
ministration and its supporters
have such a hard time with that
fact. He says that by trading
and making them prosperous
we can bring them democracy
and capitalism.

Historically, this policy
makes no sense. American
Presidents from Martin van
Buren_.to Herbert Hoover to
George Bush have lost elections
due to poor economic times,
whether or not it was their
fault. Also, Presidents like
Clinton who accomplished
nothing positive for America
were reelected due to good eco
nomic times, which he had
nothing to do with. But per
haps the best example is that
of the Soviet Union. The Soviet
Government was most secure

m the 1950s and 1960s when
the economy was good, but
collapsed in the 198O.s when
the econoni) tell apart trying
to keep up with the economic
and military giowth of Ronald
Reagan. Despite this, the
Clinton administration has
gone ahead with "constructive
engagement" and despite cam
paign promises to the contrary,
has reapproved Most Favored
Nation status for China with
plans to eventually bring China
into the World Trade Organi
zation. Entry was originally
made conditional on improve
ment of human lights in China,
however this wns Inter

dropped. In fact, human rights
disputes with China were never
really a factor, as the Clinton
administration accepted all the
trade agreements. They were
accepted even though the ad
vantage in them was given to
the PRC, and always accepted
the assurances that China
would improve its human
rights record, while in actual
ity doing nothing because the
Chinese know that Clinton will
not stand up to them. In effect,
the Clinton administrators and
the supporters of its China
policy were indirectly support
ing, whether they knew it or
not, the human rights abuses of
the PRC.

In this atmosphere
rose the Chinagate scandal and
the Cox Report. The scandal
began as fund-raising abuses in
which the Loral and Hughes
Corporation gave donations to
the Democratic National Com
mittee and the Clinton-Gore
'96 reelection campaign for
waivers to launch satellites into
space on Chinese rockets. De
spite the advice of the Secre
taries of State and Defense and
the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, and despite the
fact that Loral was under inves
tigation by the Justice Depart
ment, the waiver was granted.
Then names like John Huang,
Johnny Chung, Charlie Trie,
etc. enter the picture, it having
been discovered that they laun¬

dered millions of dollais of
Chinese mone), money that
originated horn the intelligence
and rocket toices aims of the
People's Libeiation Aimy
(PLA), or the Chinese mihtaiy.
Then comes the Wen Ho
Lee, and the Los Alamos spy
ing fiasco, followed by the Cox
Report which details how
China has essentially lifted the
plans for our entile nuclear ar
senal, beginning in the late
1970s, and receiving the key
parts to make it all work under
Bill Clinton. As a result, China
deployed its fust multiple-war
head rocket under Clinton,
which uses warheads very simi
lar to our W-88 warhead, as
well as rockets that can now hit
the majority of the United
States and at this minute have
24 aimed at us, with more im
provements to come in the fu
ture.

From this comes the de
cline in support for Taiwan by
the Clinton Administiation in
its second term. When, m [996
(an American election yeai),
China threatened to invade
Taiwan not long before its first
democratic presidential elec
tion, Clinton sent the Seventh
Fleet to China as a show of sup
port for the democratic state of
Taiwan against Communist
Chinese forces. Unfortunately,
support from this administra
tion for Taiwan has fallen off
in recent years culminating in
Clinton's statement in his infa
mous trip to China in 1998 that
Taiwan was part of the PRC.
Clinton suspended the sale of
US warplanes to Taiwan while
concluding yet anothei trade
agreement with China.
During this time too,
China has become more threat
ening to Taiwan. China has be
come more and more insistent
on final reunification talks be¬

tween Taiwan and the PRC,
and targeting missiles on the
island. Finally, just a few weeks
ago, again near a Taiwanese
presidential election, China
said that Taiwan must no
longer put off reunification
talks indefinitely, and that any¬

thing tantamount to a declaia
tion of independence would he
consideied an act ot wai
If all this was not enough,
China has, especially in the last
few weeks, become more hos
tile towauls the United States.
After the accidental bombing of
the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade during the illegal
Kosovo War, Chinese citizens
attacked the US Embassy, and
the PLA, which effectively de
stioyed a pio-democracy pro
test with tanks, was unable to
act when it was an Ann-Ameri
can protest. In January, in a
statement not carried widely m
the American Press, the Chi
nese Foreign Minister said,
"war with the United States was
inevitable." If that was not
chilling enough, on Tuesday of
this week the Washington
Times reporred that China has
threatened to use nuclear
weapons on the United States
if it came to the defense of _Tai¬

wan. To sum up the lesults of
this policy, China is more eco
nomically secure than before,
and its military, especially its
nuclear forces, becomes more
advanced every day thanks to
Ameiican technology. Taiwan
and the United States aie
threatened more by China than
evei before, and the US tiade
deficit with China is biggei
than the deficit with Japan evei
was, and is the only tiade defi
cit climbing. In othei words,
Clinton has propped up a ty
rannical Communist regime at

the expense of two democra
cies, Taiwan and the United
States.
The time has come foi a
new policy towauls China Tai
wan must be recognized foi the
independent democracy that it
is. Great democratic nations do
not throw othei demociatic
nations to the wolves of tyr
anny, and for Amenca to be the
great democratic nation that I
know she is, she must stand
beside Taiwan. Also, we must
recognize China for what it is,
the Soviet Union of the Post
Cold War world. Our polices

must leflect that. Some sup
potteis of MFN for China or
"constructive engagement" say
that if we treat China as a
friend, they will be a friend.
Well, that may sound good, but
we've been treating them as a
ft lend now for at least 7 years
and then they wanted to trade
with us, now they tlneaten to
nuke our homes. This is not the
action of a friend, or even a
competitor, but an enemy, un
fortunately.

Racism and homicide: accepted practices at Gettysburg?

Last week, as I was read
ing the aggressive attacks
against decency and tolerance
by the more liberal columnists
of The Gettysburgian, I realized
that I have only responded to
Ms. Christina Dickert's col
umns for the last two weeks.
As I thought about it, I came to
the conclusion that it is unfair
to only concentrate on her lies
and misconceptions when there
are so many others each week
in The Gettysburgian. Thus,
this week I will respond to Ms.
Rachel Hanson's column in

addition to Ms. Dickert's,
thereby writing an equal oppor
tunity retort.
Actually, the idea of equal
opportunity leads me directly
into the first half of my reply.
Ms. Dickert's column "Affirma
tive action confirms action is
still necessary", in the Febru
ary 24 Gettysburgian, is, to put
it bluntly, lacking in thought,
logic, and truth. She gives the
same tired, worn-out, liberal
line we have been hearing for
years: "Affirmative action is
NOT filling quotas - it is giv¬

ing groups that are not as privi
leged a chance to move up in
the social strata." How many
times have liberal politicians,
seeking to keep minority
groups dependent on the
Democratic party, dished out
this line? The answer: too
many. The truth is, affirmative
action is a terribly racist policy
that discriminates against
whites and insults blacks. Affir
mative action keeps qualified
people from getting jobs in
some cases and tells minorities
that they are not good enough
or intelligent enough to get a
job on their own. I cannot think
of a plank of the Democratic
platform that is weaker or more
detrimental to society as a
whole (except for abortion, but
I will get to that in a moment).
In fact, if one would like more
explanation of why affirmative
action should not be accepted
by society, one need look no
further than Dr. Martin Luther

King, Jr., the great advocate of
civil rights. Dr. King said he
had a dream that someday

people would "not be judged
by the color of their skin, but
by the content of their charac
ter." So, let me pose this ques
tion: Which form of judgment
does affirmative action utilize;
skin color or character? I think
the answer is obvious, although
many liberals like Ms. Dickert
would not like you to think so.
Now, we shall proceed to
the more exciting, and frankly
more appalling, issue of abor
tion. According to Ms.
Hanson: I or anyone else who
is pro-life should be considered
"the most feared and distrusted
members of society." She
claims that pro-life people view
women simply as machines that
are used for the production of
babies. Frankly, I cannot believe
she would make such an out¬

rageous statement in a pub
lished column. My mother is
pro-life and I think she would
be very offended to read what
Ms. Hanson thinks of her. I can
tell you that my mother cer
tainly does not think of herself
as merely an incubator for a
fetus. Rather, she regards her¬

self and other women as the
most important members of
society because they have the
ability to bung life into the
world.
Apparently Ms. Hanson
has a problem with rights to
life. She claims that it is wrong
to put the rights of a "fetus"
above the rights of a woman.
Now, I certainly support rights
for women, but there is a line
that must be drawn when dis
cussing any type of rights.
Someone once said "The right
for me to swing my fist stops
where the next man's nose be
gins." Basically, this backs up
what the constitution states:
that a person's rights are only
protected so long as they do not
infringe upon anyone else's
rights. Certainly a woman's so
called "right to choose" im
poses on the baby's right to
live!

If this is not enough to
convince Ms. Hanson, maybe
she should check her history
(or herstory). Many heroic
feminists were pro-life. Alice
Paul, author of the Equal

Rights Amendment, called
abortion "the ultimate exploi
tation of women." And Eliza
beth Cady Stanton said the fol
lowing of abortion: "When we
consider that women are
treated as property, it is degrad
ing to women that we should
treat our children as property
to dispose of as we see fit."
Would Ms. Hanson like
to be treated as property and
stripped of her right to live
without any say in the matter?
Would she rather her mother
had an abortion, so she could
not be here to push her fright
ening agenda of murdering
children simply because they
are not wanted? Does she sup
port the Holocaust? Like abor
tion, it is the practice of mass
extermination of unwanted
human beings.
I already know what Ms.
Hanson's response will be to
these questions. She will say
that a fetus is not human, rather
it is part of the mother. How-

the ViuhiitU'Sm ' s Vulpit
Bush and McCain race for Republican

by John Dunlap
Political Columnist
Senator John McCain has
begun handing Governor
George W Bush victories in the
race for the Republican presi
dential nomination. By attack
ing the founder of the Chris
tian Coalition, Pat Robertson,
a key figure among religious
conservatives, the Arizona
Senator is alienating the Repub
lican base. On top of criticiz
ing key figures in the religious
right, Senator McCain has ac
cused Governor Bush of being
anti-Catholic, despite the fact
that Bush's brother is a Catho
lic. While I may not agiee
with Senator McCain on cer
tain key issues, I have always
respected him, but in his cam
paign to take down the Gover
nor of Texas, McCain has re
sorted to pitting religious
groups against one another. It

is ironic that McCain is angry
over taped telephoned calls
that Pat Robertson made to
Michigan voters when McCain
approved and paid for scripted
calls made in numerous states
insinuating that Bush is anti
Cathohc. John McCain should
read his history and learn a les
son from John Kennedy's 1960
presidential campaign. At
tempting to divide Americans
on the basis of religion is
wrong.
What John McCain has
done is alienate himself from a
key element in the Republican
coalition. In 1980 and 1984,
Ronald Reagan put together a
winning coalition where he
united Republicans with like
minded Independents and con
servative Democrats. In e _. very
election since, Republicans to
be elected have had to put that
coalition together to carry the
west, the south, and the Mid
west. In 1992 and 1996 Bill
Clinton was able to win Cali¬

fornia by moving to the light
which allowed him to pick
apait the Republican coalition.
The problem with John
McCain is that, while he wants
to reach out, he will be destioy
mg Ronald Reagan's winning
coalition. Conservatives, par
ticularly religious conserva
tives, will flock to Pat
Buchanan's candidacy. The
media forgets this key fact
when they talk about the po
tential strength of the McCain
campaign in the general elec
tion. George W. Bush believed
that he would be attacked from
the right in this campaign, but
he has been attacked from the
left. It is ironic considering the
fact that Bush has biought
people together and been a
fighter for free and expanded
trade. His sweep of Virginia,
Washington and North Dakota
put him in a good position for
next week's national primary.
Chairman McCain ex¬

pected to win Washington,
but Governor Bush was jible to
easily defeat him in all thiee
states. He has been able to win
across the nation b > receiving
landslide victories among Re
publicans while building sup
port among Independents _antl
Democrats. Governor Bush can
put together a winning coali
tion against Vice Piesident Al
Gore. In Ins last campaign for
Governor, like President
Reagan, Bush was able to win
over a third of Hispanic vot
ers, which will be key in win
ning California.
His popularity among
conservatives means that he
will be able to leach out and
expand the Republican vote in
2000. Geoige W Bush is a re
formei who gave Texas its laig
est tax cut m history. In Texas
he has focused on reforming
education while being tough on
crime. The Governor's mes
sage of compassionate conser
vatism reaches out to Ameri¬

cans _^^fl _^^M
a n d _^ m ^"
will help re-spark the conser
vative movement in the United
States.
A final note about the
lace for presidency is that,
while Al Gore seems to have
almost easily walked into the
Democratic nomination, the
Republicans have had a spirited
contest that has led to massive
turnout. During their cam
paigns, both Bush and McCain
have continued to have high
approval ratings among the
American people while Al Gore
continues to lag behind both.
It is great to see George W
Bush and John McCain call
themselves proud conserva
tives, while Al Gore and Bill
Bradley are afraid to call them
selves what they are, liberals.
Good for the GOP

Top 5 Reasons to give to the Senior Scholarship
Before Spring Break!

avidson becomes 17th player in Bullet
history to join elite 1,000 point club

***

Senior forward Bill Davidson led the Centennial Conference
in scoring this season at 18.2 ppq.

He feels that the suc
cess he's enjoyed stems
from years of practice.
"I've worked very hard at
becoming a good player,
both in skill work and in
the weight room," he said.
But he is also quick to
credit others. "I've had
great teachers and great
teammates at every level,"
he said. "Coach Petrie, the
rest of the coaching staff,
and all my teammates
played a big part in help
ing me reach the mile
stone. I look at it as a team
award."
In addition to his
coaches and teammates,
Davidson says his family is
largely responsible for
helping him develop into
a good athlete.

"In ninth grade,
looked up to one of the
seniors, who eventually
became my brother-in
law," recalls Davidson.
"He showed me how to
act, both on and off the

court.
"I developed a good
work ethic by watching my
parents work. I often saw
my dad come home from
a 12-hour day at the office,
eat dinner, and then work
around the house until
nine or ten at night."
His parents, who
went to most of his games,
and his older sister were in
attendance the night be
reached the 1,000 point
milestone.
Aside from playing
basketball, Davidson
works for various other
campus organizations. He
serves as the student rep
resentative on the Interde
partmental Studies Com¬

mittee.
He will graduate in
May with an English de
gree and as of now is un
sure of what he'll be do
ing. For now, it appears
that his impact on the
basketball program has
been significant.
"Bill is awesome,"
said sophomore guard
Curtis McNeil. "He led
us on and off the court.
He always tried to keep
us organized'and steered
us in the right direction."
"I'll definitely miss
playing with everyone,"
said Davidson. I'm not
sure what I'll do with my

winters now

Two weeks ago, se
nior forward Bill
Davidson joined
Gettysburg's elite 1,000
point club, a distinction
he shares with only 17
other players in the his
tory of Bullet basketball.
Davidson entered
the final home game of
the year versus Ursinus
needing 20 points to
reach the milestone. He
scored points 1,000 and
1,001 on a driving layup
in the second half and
finished the game with

23. Three days later, he
scored a career-high 32 at
Dickinson to finish his
career with 1,035 points.
"I was happy to do
it in the last home game,"
said Davidson. "That
made it sort of special. It
had been a goal of mine
for a long time and I was
very happy to reach it."
A native of Annville,
PA, Davidson began play
ing basketball while in el
ementary school and
continued throughout
junior high. Although he
only played varsity for
two years in high school,
he became a member of
Annville-Cleona's 1,000
point club as well.

"I found it [reaching
the milestone] a little
more difficult in college,"
said Davidson. "We play
a slow down offense and
really spread the ball
around a lot."
Davidson began col
lege at Susquehanna Uni
versity, but soon realized

playing for the Crusaders
might never happen.
Basketball among
other things led him to
Gettysburg, where he was
a varsity starter for three
years.
"I've really enjoyed
it here," he said. "Join
ing the team eased the
transition."
Besides his difficult
freshman year at
Susquehanna, basketball
hasn't always been kind
to Davidson. He has suf¬

fered multiple severe
sprains to both ankles
and has had them both
surgically repaired.
They still irritate him
from time to time and
he tapes them before
each game.
Despite the bad
luck, Davidson still
looks at himself as for
tunate. "I'm just happy
that I've been able to
play and enjoy success
with basketball," he
said.

Women finish 3rd, men 4th at CC indoor meet
Durst and company win gold in pole vault, 4x400

Lauren Davis
Assistant Sports Ediior
There's an old athletic pioverb
that says records are made to be bro
ken, and the Gettyburg track and field
team is no exception. Numerous per
sonal bests were established and med
als were won as 14 athletes added their
names to the Gettysburg track &C field
record books at the Centennial Con
ference Championships at Haverford
last weekend. These performances
added up to a third place finish for the
Lady Bullets and a fouith place for the
men's team.
The women finished behind
Dickinson (152 points) and Haveiford
(118 points) with 68 points on the
weekend, overcoming Swarthmore by
just 3 points, proving that every place
does count. The contributions of ev
ery athlete on the team were needed to
assure the women of their third-place
status.

Senior Erika Durst sparked the
Bullets' scoring in the pole vault with a
gold-medal vault of 9-0, a meet record.
Haverford's Heidi Creel cleared the
height as well, but missed on her first
attempt to clinch Durst's victory.
The women's only other victory
came in the meet's final event, the
4x400. The team of senior Andit
Thent, juniors Courtney Hurd and Keri
Hymen, and first-year Joanna Silver ran
a school record time of 4:12.29 to out
distance Haverford by 3 seconds.
It was Silver's second school
record of the weekend, as she had ear
lier finished 3rd in the open 400 with
a time of 61.11, closely followed by Hy
men, fifth in 61.90.
The Lady Bullets also got fifth-

place finishes
from Hymen
in the 200
(27.48) and
senior Anne
Schenck in the
55-meter dash

(7.74).
Schenck's
diversity on
the track as
well as in the
field were es
sential to the
team's perfor
mance, as she
collected points m the
long jump,
third with a
leap of 16-9 1/
4, and in the
high jump
(6th in 4-10).
Senior
Cathy
Spangler con
eluded Gettysburg's
scoring in the
field with a

35-1 1/4
throw in the
shot put, good
for second
place. The dis
| ance team
chipped in 15
points through the
course of the
meet, scoring
in five of six
distance events

Junior Kelley Lord (left) and sophomore Abby Jackson

Conference meet on Saturday.

On Friday, the distance ;tance

medley team picked up a sixth-place fin

added fifrh-places in the 3000 (11:02.3)
and the 1500 in a school record

''_, > " The women came back strong on
."_] „" Saturday as the 4x800 team of first-year
C'_^l; Sarah Barnes, sophomores Robin Roger
and Emily Lanning, and junior Tracy
Swackhamer began the day's events
with a third-place finish in a school
record time of 10:05.5. Davis later fin
ished fourth in the 800 with a time of
2:27.8.
Overall, the Lady Bullets estab
lished 4 new school records and col
lected 7 medals at the meet.

"Each membei of the team did
their best and gave their all to their
event and for this reason numerous
records were broken and PRs were set,"
said women's co-captain Kelley Lord of
her team's peifonnance.
Meanwhile, the men improved on
last yeai's 7th place finish, scoring 33
points to finish behind Haverford,
Dickinson, and Franklin & _Maishall.
Like the women, the men needed every
point to guaiantee their position—
Johns Hopkins and Western Maryland
both finished within two points of the
Bullets.
Junior Will Hannema led the Bul
lets' _scoi ing with a thud-place finish in
the pole vault, dealing a height of 12-6
to collect the bionze.
The 4x200 lelay proved to be a
major highlight of the men's meet, as
the team of juniors Jeff Cumpson, J.T.
Farrell, and Nick LaPorta and first-year
Phil Ferarro combined to break the
school record m a time of 1:33.17 and
finish fourth. Ferano also scored in the
400, finishing sixth in 52.42.

The Bullets also got fourth-place
finishes from first-year Chris Buchanan
in the 55-meter hurdles (8.13), sopho
more Chris Russo in the high jump (6
0), and senior Mike Williams in the shot
put (43-5 1/4 ). Junior Jere Dee fin
ished 5th behind Williams with a throw
of 42-10 1/4.
The Bullets wrapped up their scor
ing with points from their third-place
4x400 and 4x800 teams (3:29.65 and
8:27.66, respectively).
Senior captain Scott Grabus was
happy with his team's performance:
"Everyone improved their marks and
times this weekend. It really showed
that everyone competed hard."
He was also impressed with the
younger athletes' showing, a sign of the
team's potential in years to come. "1
think the freshmen really showed us
what they've got. They performed great
and were very mature."
"It was a really positive way to end
the indoor season and a good confi
dence booster for both teams as we start
outdoor track this week," said Lord of
both teams' performances.

The Bullets now begin their spring
training to prepare for their first oudoor
meet on March 28, a quad meet with
Johns Hopkins, Columbia Union, and
Messiah at home.
