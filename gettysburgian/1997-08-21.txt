Gettysburg announces Cosby Scholarship

Noted educator and entertainer Bill
Cosby was the speaker for Gettysburg's
162nd Commencement exercises held this
past May 1. At that time, the College an
nounced its establishment of a scholarship
in the name of Ennis Cosby, the speaker's
late son, who was killed earlier this year.
According to the announcement, be
ginning in 1998 funds donated by Gettys
burg College trustees will be used to annu
ally provide a partial scholarship to a stu
dent attending Gettysburg College. Approxi
mately 40 current and past College trustees
have made initial donations of almost
$50,000 to the fund.
The Ennis Cosby Scholarship will be
awarded with preference to students who

Award established in memory of entertainer's late son

from Staff Repor ts

have particular interest in becoming teach
ers. Preference will also be given to stu
dents from the greater Philadelphia area.
"When one considers the lifetime of
caring and giving that Bill Cosby has un
selfishly lived, the tragic death of Ennis,
his only son, virtually begged for a com
passionate, yet dignified response," said
Bruce Stefany, the Gettysburg trustee who
coordinated the scholarship fund-raising
among the trustees. "We were looking for
an effort that would carry forward the good
works of Bill cosby and those that were done
by Ennis. We know we cannot replace the
person, but Gettysburg College is commit
ted, through the scholarship, to helping oth
ers complete Ennis' unfulfilled pursuits in
education and teaching," added Stefany.
Cosby indicated an interest in address

In his conferring the honorary degree
upon Cosby, College president, Gordon
Haaland called Cosby's past achievements

"classics of American comedy." Haaland
also told the entertainer that "You have dis
mantled barriers of race and color and set
aside stereotypes, gently but firmly, by be
ing yourself. You have helped make us com
fortable with difference and diversity; you

have somehow taught us to value both our
racial and cultural identity, and our com
mon humanity. In triumph and in tragedy,
you've shown us how it's done. We are
proud to claim you as a native Pennsylva
nian."

Gettysburg: a beginner's guide to campus life

"I'll meet you in fifteen
minutes at Stine Lake and we can
head over to Servo. Or maybe
we can just go to LD's, but first I
have to swing over to the CUB
and hit the MAC."
Your friend just called
and left this message on you an
swering machine. You've been
here for less than a week, so natu
rally you think, "what is he talk
ing about?" Have no fear, new
student, because this handy litle
glossary of Gettysburg-speak is

sure to get you through these so
cial straits unscathed and sound
ing like an old 'Burg pro.
First things first. "Where
am I now?" and "You want me to
go where?"
Servo: a.k.a. the Dining
Hall. Probably nicknamed back
when the college's dining service
was contracted out to a company
called Servomation (eons ago).
Anyhow, you eat here. Tip: Get
here early on Premium Entree
Night. The Cordon Bleu rules.

CUB: a.k.a. The Col
lege Union Building. Here you
will find the mailroom, school
store, ballroom, first-year student
laundry room and the campus al
ternative to Servo, Cafe 101.
The Junction (for -
meriy known as _tlieEtive): This
is a place that studetn organiza
tions can hold meetings, the Stu
dent Activities Council has live
performances and movies, and
where students can just hang out.
Cafe 101: a.k.a. the
Bullet Hole. Looking for a quick

snack while you're on the run?
Travel beyond the Junction, past
the mailroom, and you're in The
Hole. You have $3.75 on you
meal card that's good for break
fast, lunch and dinner. Remem
ber, only two prepackaged items
per meal. The catch to Cafe 101
is that you can only use your meal
cards at specific hours: 8:00 -
10:15 am for breakfast, 1:30 -
4:00 pm for lunch, and 4:30- 9:00
pm for dinner. However, it stays
open until midnight in case
you're in the mood for a late night
snack.

Mailroom: Every week
day, between 11:30 am and 1 pm,
the mailroom transforms from a
drab series of metal boxes into the
very epicenter of social activity at
Gettysburg College. Here the
evening's plans are made, adn flirt
ing is perfected, check your mail,
two, three, four times a day!
MAC: a.k.a. Money Ac
cess Center, this is an automated
teller machine outside the CUB. It's
the same as MOST, Cirrus, or what
ever you're used to. This innocent
looking machine cna be both a Fri
day night life-saver and a Sunday
morning nightmare. Beware of the
lure of fast cash.
MusseknanLibrar y: It's
Tuesday night and nothing's going
on. where can I go to hang out and
meet new people? The Library is
the answer. On any given evening,
the first floors are filled with stu
dents pretending to study while

picking up the lastest gossip on
campus. Plus, when you get home
and find that your parents have
called, you can honestly say that
you were at the library. But being
there and studying are two entriely
different issues. If you really need
to do some work, the third adn
fourth fllors are your best bet. Night
owls will be happy to see that the
library is opne 24 hours a day. And
for those slaves to the almighty
bean, librarians brew coffee and
provide hot water for tea adn cocoa
for those students pulling all
nighters. Also, the library has three
day/three movie video rentals. They
may not have all the newest re
leases, but they do have some of the
best movies ever made. The library
is one of the three "Mussleman"
locations on campus, the others be
ing Mussleman stadium, and
Mussleman Hall, located in the
_Upperclass Quad.

Bream Wright Hauser:
This is the campus gym adn field
house. It's located beyond the CUB
adn across hte street from the Apple
apartments. Be sure you don't con
fuse Bream with the...
Plank Gym: This older
_eym is found between the CUB and

Masters Hall. There s a games 334-0505: Advanced sys
room adn fitness room in the base- tem run by the local newspaper,

basement. Make some requests
and bug the DJ by dialing x6313.
Many studetn organizations also
call Plank home, including the Stu
dent Activites office, GECO
(enviornmental concerns organiza
tion), the Black Student Union,
Student Senate, the Gettysburgian,
the Spectrum (yearbook), and the
IFC (Interfraternity Council), the
Center for Public Service is also in
Plank, but on the first floor.
Stine Lake: Not really a
lake at all, Stine Lake is actually
the open area between Plank Gym
and the library. One theory for the
origin of its odd name may be that
the field is known to flood during
heavy stroms. Almost knee-deep
water is not unusual on the "lake."
After a nastystorm, put on old
clothes, go out, slide around and
have your own little Woodstock.

Brua Hall, Kline The
ater,andStevens Theater: These
are all the same place and for that
reason, it can get rather confusing.
Schmucker Hall: This is
the colege's art and music build
ing. Stop in and check out the art
gallery which is filled with the
work of your fellow
gettysburgians. Frequent recitals
and concerts there, too. and they're
free! Other Important Stuff
OneRing/_T woRings: If
the phone rings once, it's an on
campus cal, and you can risk an
swering it with a more creative
greeting. If it has a double ring,
it's most likely Mom and shoudl be
anwered accordingly.

The Weather Guy(s):
There are two numbers you can cal
to get time adn hte local weather.
These numbers are helpful, but
they can becoem serious habits.
You'll soon find yourself calling
them before you walk across the
hall. Anyway, here's the spiel:

your world is fast asleep. Grab
aconscious amigo and hit the

sinful desserts and colorful late

rules. Pizza, pizza, pizza:
Each with its own pros adn cons,
the gettysburg area has many
pizza places but only thrcee de

and Dominos. If you have the
ways and means (i.e. a car),
Stavros Pizza in Emmitsburg, just
over the Maryladn line, is well
worth the trip.

Ernie s Texas Lunch:
Located across Chambersburg
Street from K&K Records, Ernie's
has been catering to the lunch adn
dinner crowds of gettysburg for
three generations. An "Ernie Dog"
is not to be missed, and for those
vegetarians out there, Ernies of

North Washington and
Chambersburg streets, S'leven is
the perfect place to satisfy any of

College receives grant for Civil war Studies program

gcpr Gettysburg College has been
awarded a grant of more than
$500,000 from the Henry Luce
Foundation to support the estab
lishment of a professorship in Civil
War studies. The Henry R. Luce
Professor of the Civil War Era will
lead an undergraduate program in
Civil War studies and will develop
and direct "The Gettysburg Semes
ter," a program selecting students
from across the country to partici
pate in a semester of intensive in
terdisciplinary study of the Civil
War era. Funds from the grant,
which covers an initial period of
six years, will be used primarily
to provide salary and benefits for

a faculty member chosen to fill the
Luce Professorship. The grant was
announced by the Foundation's
Chairman Henry Luce III. The
Luce Professor will be selected by
a committee at the College after
completion of a national search.
The recipient's appoint
ment will be made in 1998, and the
Luce Professor will begin teach
ing at Gettysburg by the fall of
1999. Gettysburg is one of only
tow higher education institutions
to receive a professorship from the
Luce Foundation during this year.
The other was Johns Hopkins Uni
versity. "Gettysburg College is
very grateful for the support of the

Luce Foundation which will allow
us an opportunity to develop great
strength in Civil War studies, we
sincerely believe that we can de
velop a program unmatched at any
other site in the country," said
Gordon Haaland, president of Get
tysburg College. "Our aim is to
use of existing relationships with
the community of Civil War schol
ars and our natural geographic con
nection with the pivotal battle of
that War to establish an integrated
first-rate undergraduate program
that allows not only our students
but also visiting students access to
a unique combination of scholar
ship and original research materi
als." "Many of the basic issues

of contemporary American society
came into focus during the Civil
War era, among those being the
relevance of race in a democracy,
the proper balance of federal and
state government, the principles
that bind Americans, the meaning
of a union. We think that a
multidisciplinary examination of
the Civil War era is a wonderful,
rich, and sound way to examine
our social fabric," said Dr. Daniel
DeNicola, the college's chief aca
demic officer.
"The professorship will
provide scholarly leadership for an

intensive program in this era, ad
dressing not only the causes and
events of the Civil War and its af
termath, but its cultural and intel
lectual milieu. The program will
draw on not only miliary and po
litical history, but, among many,
the fields of economics, sociology,
philosophy, African-american
studies, women's studies, rhetoric,
religion, literature, the visual arts,
and music. Such a study helps us
understand what was changed and
what was preserved by the war,
what was lost arid gained," added
DeNicola.

The Henry R. Luce Pro
fessorship Program wa established
in 1969 by the New York-based
foundation to encourage academic

innovation and creativity through
integrative and interdisciplinary
approaches to teaching and re
search in American private higher
education.
The first recipient of the
Luce Professorship in Civil War
Studies will be responsible for fur
ther developing existing College
curricular programs into an aca
demic concentration or minor pro
gram, with direct responsibility for
teaching the introductory and
capstone courses in that program.
By the third year of the grant, the
Luce Professor will develop and
the direct "The Gettysburg Semes
ter," for which up to 25 under
graduate students will be selected
from applicants across the coun
try for a one-semester, integrated
program of Civil War studies.

We will continue to sup
port the Luce Professor, the estab
lished Gettysburg program, and
the Gettysburg Semester upon the
completion of the six-year Luce
grant period," said DeNicola.
"The college has the option of ap
plying to the Luce Foundation for
three additional years of support,
and we are confident that our pro
grams will show sufficient
progress and strength to warrant
serious consideration."

College offers
off campus guide

There is lots to do at Gettys
burg, but sometimes students like
to get off the campus to explore
what is available in the surround
ing area. Dean of First Year Stu
dents, Robert Nordvall, has put
together a resource that sets out
opportunities for fun and recre
ation on campus and beyond. In
cluded in is information about
what to do and about things to do
in Harrisburg, Lancaster, Balti
more, Washington, and other
nearby cities.
The guide includes infor¬

mation about shopping (where are
the big malls?), parks, theaters,
movies, clubs, concerts, museums,
sports teams, and miscellaneous
attractions within an 80 mile radius
of the College. Driving instruc
tions are included so students can
find out how to get to these attrac
tions. The address for this
Guide on the Web is http://

Beware the dangers of binge drinking

College Press Service
Jennifer, a Northwestern
University Junior, doesn't recall
how she ended up at Evanston
Hospital one early morning during
Spring Quarter last year. The last
thing she remembered was doing
tequila shots with a guy she met at
a fraternity party, and then her
world turned black.
Jennifer had a blood alcohol
level of about .21, more than twice
the legal limit in Illinois, and was
unconscious when friends took her
to Evanston Hospital's emergency
room. Her breathing was irregu
lar, and her friends told her that she
looked like a ghost.
"I was so scared," Jennifer
says as she shakes her head and
looks at the floor. "It was one of
the worst moments of my life. I
thought I was having such a good

Adelman writes devilish book

time, and then I wake up in the
hospital with a needle in my arm."
Doctors had to hook Jenni
fer up to an IV to dilute her blood
quickly and lower her blood alco
hol content. Jennifer, who doesn't
want her last name used, says the
experience changed her life be
cause she is one of the lucky ones.
She is still alive.
At least 800 high school and
college students died from alcohol
poisoning in 1994, but researchers
think the number might be higher
than 4,000 because many deaths
related to alcohol may be attributed
to other causes like cardiac arrest,
according to Students Against
Drunk Driving.

was to bring to Devil's Den the
attention it deserves as a promi
nent, but often overlooked, part of
the three-day battle," said
Adelman.
The book details the history
and folklore surrounding the site,
covers in-depth the events during
the battle, and concludes with a
detailed guide for visitors.
Adelman joined Gettysburg
College in 199S as part of the
College's dining services opera
tion.

ministrator has co-written the first

history and significance of Devil's

long students of Civil War history,
has co-written "Devil's Den: A

isn't surprised to learn about
Jennifer's experience. She often
hears of drunk students who are
found in odd places on campus,
then shipped into Evanston Hos
pital for care.
A recent survey conducted
by the American Medical Associa
tion showed that 40 percent of 800
eighteen to thirty-year olds drink
to levels that impair judgment and
physical performance.
The results demonstrate a
sad, unconscionable waste of tal
ent and potential by our country's
young people," says Nancy
Dickey, chair ofAMA's board of
trustees.
Although many people mis
take alcohol for a stimulant be
cause it can make people more

lively than their usual selves, al
cohol is actually a depressant. If a
person drinks enough alcohol it
can shut the body's immune sys
tem down and affect the circula
tory and respiratory systems.
Hong points out that many
people don't know that alcohol
alone can kill you, and you don't
have to be into the driver's seat to
die from it.
"People are afraid of taking
someone into the hospital because
of the possible consequences, or
they think that the person is passed
out and will be OK in the morn
ing," Hong says. "But this is seri
ous and instead of worrying about
the person getting in trouble, I
think it's more important that you
could be saving that person's life."

A SADD brochure lists sev
eral cases in which young adults
have died from alcohol poisoning,
including a story about Marie
Brinkmeyer. She was 18 and a
first-year student at Texas A&M
University when she bought a
bottle of tequila and took it to a
dormitor party. After drinking
heavily, Brinkmeyer collapsed adn
was carried to her bed to sleep it
off. She never woke up.
"I don't think people are
aware 1 of all the damage alcohol
can do," says Dr. David Barthwell,
medical director for the drug and
alcohol program at Northwestern
Memorial Hospital in Chicago.
"Alcohol companies make alcohol
look so appealing, but the truth is,
if you aren't careful, it can kill
you."

Involvement, participation required for success, says Nordvall

Dean of First Year Students urges new arrivals to get involved

GCPR When students first come
to college, the number of pos
sible activities to join is over
whelming. In addition, there is
the academic challenge of col
lege courses, dean of First Year
Students, Robert Nordvall, rec
ommends that students take their
time reviewing the options avail
able and deciding the activities
in which they want to participate
at Gettysburg, but he notes that
first year students should become
involved in the life of the Col
lege. A leading scholar on
the affect that college has upon
students is Dr. Alexander W.
Austin of the Cooperative Insti
tutional Research Program at

UCLA. Dr. Astin os an alumnus of
Gettysburg College. His work indi
cates that the quality of the educa
tional experience that students get in
college is directly related to how
much they are involved both inside
and outside the classroom in their
college experience. Not surpris
ingly, students who put more effort
into college, receive much greater
benefits from their four years of
higher education.
Dean Nordvall empha
sizes, however, that although almost
all activities provided benefits, not
all co-curricular activities are equal
in what they provide to students.
Students should look for activities
that provided to them strong oppor
tunities for personal growth. A small
group of activities that have proved
particularly powerful in fostering the

growth and development of stu
dents are the service learning pro
grams and community service pro
grams, and opportunities for inde
pendent study and research with
professors. There are activities
that students name as particularly
impor tant as they reflect upon their
four years at Gettysburg. There
four are not the only activities that
play such a role, and students can,
of course, take part in a number of
very beneficial activities at the
College. The Gettysburg Is Volun
teering (GIV) Day activities on the
Monday afternoon of Orientation
from 6:30 pm - 8:00 pm there will
be an Open House at the Center
for Public Service at which stu
dents can find out more about com
munity service and service learn¬

ing programs. Study abroad op
portunities will be discussed in the
rotating discussion sessions on
Monday morning of Orientation.
First year students do not ordi
narily work on research and inde
pendent study projects with pro
fessors, but during their first year
students should be sampling the
various academic programs at the
College in order to find out which
programs offer the academic chal
lenges and opportunities that are
most attractive to them.
Service learning pro
grams, community service pro
grams, study abroad, and indepen
dent study and research are pow
erful experiencesbecause they
stretch students. They force stu
dents to do and see new things.

They force students to look at the
world differently. Students can
graduate from Gettysburg College
without participating in any of
these programs, but students who
want to experience the full range
of a Gettysburg College education
should select the best opportuni
ties that the College has to offer,
both inside and outside of the class
. room.

Individualism 101

Hi, hello and welcome to
the orange and blue branch on
your tree of education: Gettysburg
College. While the world spins
wildly out of control, and empires
rise and fall around us, here
strands your academic oasis ~ and
here stands you.
In case you were won
dering, this is the student news
paper ~ your source for all kinds
fo stuff, including campus news
and opinion, but more about that
later. Here's something you
can do: leave your newly arranged
room, step out of your dorm, and
take a good look around. Notice
the green grass, the majestic build
ings. Wander around the param
eter of the campus, look at the fra
ternity houses. Sit on the steps of
Mussleman Library or the base of
the fountain and let your eyes feast
upon your new home.

Now go back to your
room and look at the mirror. Look
at yourself, remeber yourself.

And realize that all you have seen
means nothing if you do not remain
true to the person in the mirror.
Yes, this sounds like petty
advice, but consider it a moment.
At Gettysburg College you will
face your greatest academic chal
lenges and will have to pass your
most demanding tests of character.
Pressures will rise that might in
timidate you into becoming some
one you never met before. TheAll
American Scholar. The Generation
X'er. The Product of a Liberal Arts
Education. These are all nice
people, but you must question, are
they me? Oddly enough, some cli
ches do apply, including "Get In
volved" and "Be Yourself." This
campus truly offers some great
things, but some of the greatest
things are yet to appear. That's
where you come in. The college
has its weaknessess — for one, it's
just too darn expensive. Another
is its lack . of cohesiveness: for a
school of less than 2000, it is a

common thing to graduate with a
class of virtual strangers. If any
one is going to make a difference,
it will be with unique and bold
ideas and action, ones that focus
on what is best for the students (it
seems that sometimes people for
get about that sector of the "cam
pus community.")
The Gettysburgian ex
tends a hand to individuals will
ing to express their views candidly
and with fervor. We look forward
to earning your respect as your
Voice, but just in case we don't,
let us know about.
Do get involved, because
you can make the difference. Put
your prejudices aside and help
bring soem real energy to this
place. There's more here to learn
than what's in the classrooms, and
there's more to do here than spend
tuition money.

UJZBT 91.1 FM

by Colleen DeBaise
College Pr ess Service
IOWACITY-For 18-year
old freshman Sharon Monaghan,
the adjustment to campus life at
the University of Iowa has been
close to trouble-free.
Except, "I forgot my robe,"
she said. "I'd really like that."
Also, she'd like a laundry bag.
The toughest part for her,
she says, is getting used to the aca
demic demands of college.
"It's a lot more work than
high school," said Monaghan, who
plans to major in biochemistry. "I
feel like a dork. I come home, do
work and then I go to bed by nine.
I'm just kind of waiting for the
homework to pile on."
So far, she gets along well
with her roommate, and they've
lofted their beds to squeeze a
couch into their tiny dorm room.
And she's not too homesick.
"You think about going
home, but all your stuff is here,"
she explains.

Being away from home.
Coping with studies. Dealing with
roommates.
Those are just some of the
concerns that nearly every incom¬

ing freshman has during the first
few weeks on campus.
A number of publication
many written by recent grads— of
fer helpful tips on surviving cam
pus life. They list tips on how to
manage with the "roommate from
hell," how not to gain the "fresh
man 15," and how to keep in touch
with Mom and Dad.
For instance, Joe Tur ton, a
1994 graduate of Denison Univer
sity in Granville, Ohio, recently
finished writing "My Freshman
Manual: The Official College
Handbook."
At Denison, Turton was a
psychology major and an athlete,
and he describes himself as
"someone who recently has been
in the trenches and is willing to
share these lessons with others."
"If I had known all the

things I included in the book be
forehand," Turton said, "I would
have avoided many problems my
self." His advice for college fresh
man: Get a phone card for calling
home. It will save you a lot of
money, and you won't have an

excuse for not calling the parents.
When you fill out your
maintenance room report at the
beginning of the year, mark every
single detail, as well as a few ex
tra. School fines can be outra
geous for very small damages to
your room.
Buy an alarm clock that has
a battery back-up. The power al
ways seems to go out in the middle
of the night.
Get to know the professors
in your major department. Letters
of recommendation are very use
ful when you are looking for a job.
Following those "rules of
thumb" will help alleviate the
stress of freshman year, Turton
said. Melanie Sponholz, a 1993
graduate of Drew University in
Madison, N.J., and her husband
Joseph Sponholz, a 1994 grad of
New York University, offer their
advice to freshman in "College
Companion: Attaining Academic
and Social Nirvana."

The book, recently pub
lished by the Princeton Review,
was written because "facing life
in a pantry-sized dorm room with

a total stranger might not be the
easiest of situations," according to
the 25-year-old authors.
They lace the book with real
students' stories gleaned from in
terviews they conducted with cur
rent college students, and com
mentary drawn from the Princeton
Review's surveys of more than
56,000 college students.
First off, the Sponholzes of
fer these tips for incoming fresh¬

man: Take care of money matters.
Open a savings and checking ac
count with a local bank, but shop
around for the best fees. Some
banks require students maintain a
minimum balance; others tack on
charges for using automatic-teller
machine cards at machines not
owned by the bank.
Have a "ground rules" chat
with your roommate. You'll each
be glad you took the time to work
out a plan to accommodate each
other's study, sleeping, eating, and
CD-blasting habits.
But, "don't be a dork about
this," the Sponholzes warn. In
stead of handing your roommate
a typed list of suggestions, have

lunch together and talk about how
you both like to live.
Once a freshman has settled
into classes and dormlife, a whole
new set of problems can arise, ac
cording to the authors.
Melanie Sponholz bases her
advice on her two years as a resi
dent advisor at a Drew dormitory.
Joseph Sponholz's perspective
comes from his years as an NYU
"frat guy" and intramural athlete.
Their tips are:
If you have the "roommate
from hell" give it some time. Dur
ing orientation week, you and your
roommate might spend 24 hours
a day with each other. But once
the school year starts, you'll most
likely have separate classes and
activities to give you some space.
Soon, you'll meet other people
and you can hang out in their
rooms.

"It's also important that you
and your roommate talk about ev
ery problem as it occurs," the
Sponholzes advise. "This way
you'll avoid a bunch of little ar
guments creating a huge blowout
between you and your roommate."

CAMPUS PLANNING CALENDAR
The staff of the Office of Student Activities/College Union is very
excited to be a part of CNAV and what it is offering the College
community.
CNAV offers a calendar of events that is similar to the Planning
Calendar that has been published by our office.
To be environmentally sensitive and in response to the budget,
our office decided to eliminate the calendar.

Tips to guide you through the labarinth of College

Dear Casey.

by Casey Dunn
staffwriter Hello, and welcome to your
college experience! Please keep
your arms and legs inside the ride
at all times and do not exit until
the ride has come to a complete
stop. Oops, wrong introduction, I
guess summer is still not out of my
system, yet. Well, if you are still
reading, let me introduce myself,
I am Casey Dunn, the advice col
umnist, a new addition to the stu
dent news paper.
Although, in order for
this to work, I am going to need
your help. I need to have things to
give advice on, so send concerns,
questions, comments, ect to Box
#618 orBurgian @ gettysburg.edu,
and check the paper for the re
sponse from the oracle of advice,
myself.

As for this first issue I am
offering my Top Ten list of advice
I have compiled after my first year
here as a student and member of
the community. It is meant to be
both humorous and serious, so take
some time and peruse it. And be
sure to send in letters. Enjoy.
#10) Welcome to reality
well, not quite. College is a new,
independent experience, and at
first you may feel that this IS real
ity, but if you take time to think
about it, you might not be too anx
ious to cash in that reality check.
For example, in reality you have
to push more than one button to
get your laundry clean, unlike

those nifty machines that the col
lege offers. Also, reality does not
seem to accept those swell student
ID cards in exchange for food and
access to neccessary facilities, like
the fitness and weight room.
While we are on the topic of ID
cards, be sure to keep in mind that
MAC machines do not accept
them, and that you actually have
to have money in an account, BE
FORE you can access it. It is
sometimes nice to wish that real
ity was as sweet as collge. Keep
dreaming, folks, before you know
it, you will have to wake up. />
#9) Play hard, buj_^ork
harder. Even though we mdy ' pride
ourselves with bcing_^ jfiature, re
sponsible adults, capable of mak¬

ing independent decisions, we
have to be able to let our hair down
and live the life our parents could
only dream of having. This privi
lege of independence does carry
with it a cumbersome, yet fully
color coordinated, set of baggage.
As it is a privilege to be indepen
dent, we must show that we are
responsible, and able to handle that
privilege. The key here is balance,
folks. If your playful side puts on
too many extra pounds, from a
little too much beer, it is going to
throw you skinny responsible side
off the seesawand into the great
sand box of displaced college stu
dents. #8) Reputation, a blem¬

ish even Cover Girl can not fix.
This college is small and can be
come even smaller when everyone
knows where you have been sleep
ing. Bottom line is this, you might
think it is really cool to be able to
chug a bottle of Boon's wine in the
time span of the song Roxanne, but
even your ever so sexy alcohol tol
erance will not gain you the right
respect. The respect that everyone
deserves, but so many people
make the point of loosing. Do not
succumb to belittling your talents
and abilities, trust me, when the
party is over and the laughter is
faded, YOU and you alone are left
with only a hangover and porce
lain bowl to cry to.

#7) Respect, respect, re
spect. Everyone knows the 3 R's
of education, well these are the
three R's of life. Basically, if we
as a whole showed common re
spect to people this world would'"'
be a much more pleasant place to
live, starting with this campus.
Think of all the people,that help
make this place operate, the main
tenance crew, the/dinning center
and bullet hole _^ staff, the office ad
ministrator_^ 'and a myriad more.
_Sometimes; sadly, it seems that
college _^ students will look down
uno ' n these people, sorry folks, but
/tifese unique and talented people
were not put on this campus to put
the plush carpet under your "su
perior" feet. Give them respect.
Take time to appreciate their tal
ents.

#6) Have you hugged
your friend today? There is so
much written, sung, and praised
about friends. They are the ones
that sit on the highway with you
for three hours in 100 degree tem
peratures after your car overheats
and the engine seizes. They hu
mor you and participate in your
inane quests to see the sun rise
multiple days in a row. They en
able us to face each day with a
smile and give us no good excuse
for beating ourselves with our own
backbones on not so kosher days.
Yes, and the best part folks, is they

are absolutely, one hundred per
cent free. True friends, which of
ten take a while to find, and come
with no strings attached. First, re
spect yourself enough not to be
used and mistreated by people who
use you as a stepping stone to gain
their ultimate goal of a reputation.
Trust me, their reputation of being
a manipulative back slabber will
get you no where in the long run.
Second, appreciate your friends. A
good friend of mine once sent me
a poem, entitled "A Friend is
Someone Who Stays After Every
one Else Leaves", this touched me

»»rw»r arn
deeper than anymaterial apprecia
tion could have possibly done, but
it also made me realize that- this
was a true friend. She appreciated
me, and I'll tell you,. I was eu
phoric. /
#5) Parents. Wouldn't it
be nice to really, honestly believe
that we no longer have any con
nections with them, besides the 28
g's_, they are shelling out for our
education. Sorry, Sam, it is impos
sible. Yes, I know, independence,
responsibility, maturity, yadayada,
yada...but let's take a minute and

reflect on who helped you get to
where you are now. Who would
sit in the freezing November rain
to watch the everlasting soccer
matches? Who brought flowers to
your first stage performance, as
Dorothy, "In the Wizard of Oz"?
Who drove you, incessantly, to
every Laser Tag match in the state,
because you truly believed you
could conquer your arch enemies
with one swift blow from your la
ser beam. To our parents, we are
the super heroes. I say let's make
our parents the super heroes, and

us be the trainee sidekicks. The
future is a tough place, and who
better to prepare us than Mom and
Dad, defenders of the universe,
well, maybe just the car.
#4) Appreciate some
one important. Yourself. This is
tough advice to follow, especially
when your world is whizzing
around at the speed of light and
you are so deeply buried in your
new and exciting life, you often to
forget about important things.
Sleep, food, and rest, just to name
a few. Take care of you first. This
may sound self centered and self
ish, but honestly how can you ex
pect to do anything productive if
you are a walking around in a half
spent state, so stressed you are at
tempting to light a cigarette with
the filter side out. Not very. In or
der to enjoy the tremendous feast
of opportunities that is placed on
the plate of the future, you must
first learn how to chew, not gobble.
Careful folks, you might choke.

#3) The only thing that
is permanent in life is change. This
is a simple concept that most
people find a difficult time remem
bering. You know how it goes, you
stay up all night and cram for a test
that in the morning you are so sure
you have in the bag because you
can regurgitate all of Darwin's
theory's, you've memorized
Boyle's Law, you can label all
the parts of a semi-permeable
membrane of a eukariotic cell and
of course know all the enzymes of
the digestive system, and does the
Prof, ask anyof this on the test?
No, of course not. You flunk, and

are bummed. But, wait. Think of
how many tests you will take in
your future. Think about how in
ten years you will in no possible
remember you ever took this class,
and how you can not even remem
ber who Darwin was. My friend
once shared with me her mountain
and mole hill theory. You see, you
are looking at your situation up
close. You see it as a huge moun
tain that must be surpassed. Take
some steps back, let change occur,
and look at it now. It is now a mole
hill. Not as big as it seemed, and
laughable that you even thought so
much about it. Bottom line, there
is no problem that time can not fix.

It is all in how you deal with
change. #2) Get involved. You
have probably heard this a bizillion
times by now, but you need to hear
it some more. So you are at are at
Gettysburg College. With the as
sistance of many people you have
arrived on campus and now it is
up to you to make a splash with
your four year tenure here. At this
point of your life you are swim
ming in a sea of options. You can
either lay back and let the tide take
you in, or grab your boogie board
and take the ride of your life. My
advice: Hang ten, baby.
#1) Go to class. This is
by far my best piece of advice. The
main reason you are here is to re¬

ceive a quality education that will
take you places in life. Alright,
folks, we are the future. Scary,
isn't it? In ten years we will be
holding Government positions,
heading FBI operations, making
and breaking the stock market,
making more g's than Bill Gates,
and raising the new future. Times
are changing rapidly, and we need
to be able to keep pace. The per
fect training; a well rounded, fine
tuned education. GO TO CLASS.
If not for yourself, for others who
have to deal with you in the future,
for your parents who want the best
for you, and above all, for the Pro
fessors, who care enough to offer
you one of life's most precious
gifts, an education.

So that is it. Some are of
these are harder to follow than oth
ers. Some you might not agree
with. Some you may think are stu
pid. But I hope they make you
think. Reflect on exactly why you
are here, what you want to gain
from this experience, and what you
hope to offer others. I wish you
the best of luck in the upcoming
years and hopeful after this year
you will have some of your own

Women s tennis ends season second in conference

From Staff Reports
Junior Kate Goodall
and sophomore Bev Jack
son emerged as the leading
players on Gettysburg
College's 1997 women's
tennis team.
Gettysburg completed
the regular season with a
14-2 record and was 8-2 in
the Centennial Conference,
good for second place. The
Bullets were the defending
conference champs.
Goodall, playing out
of the number six singles
post most of the season,
recorded a 14-1 record.
Jackson, who handled the
number five spot through
out the season, was 14-2
for the year.

Goodall and Jackson
formed Gettysburg's top
number three doubles team
and were also the team
leaders in that area. They
posted a 13-1 record, the
second best in the Centen
nial Conference.
However, the season's
top honor went to the
Bullets' number two
singles player, senior
Cynthia Hoenes. Hoenes
not only made the All
Centennial Conference first

team, but was named co
player of the year, along
with Johns Hopkins' Zeena
Abdi. Hoenes posted a 13
3 record.
Hoenes, one of only
two seniors on this year's
team, completes her colle
giate career with a stunning
54-13 singles record and a
48-10 doubles mark for an
overall 102-23 record.
Hoenes was joined by
junior Tara Schmitt to form
Gettysburg's number one
doubles team. They were
14-2 on the season and
were named to the all
conference first team.
They won their first seven
matches to end the season
with 14 wins.

Hoenes not only
proved to be a strong
competitor on the court, but
in the classroom as well.
She and senior Mary Joy •
Troxel were named to the
Centennial Conference's
academic honor roll for
carrying a 3.40 GPA or
better.
Gettysburg completed
its sixth season under head
coach Bill Pfitzinger this

honors on the Gettysburg
College varsity golf team
which completed its
season in the spring.
Forbes was named to

Forbes captured his second
straight Centennial Confer
ence championship and
completed the season with
935 strikes for 12 rounds

ence championships, he set

during the season.

Rounding out

85.2 average for 11 rounds;
freshman Rick Deutsch, 89.1

Strong starting lineup, Streeter s 20th make for promising season

From Staf f Reports
Not only will
Gettysburg College be
launching its 105th football
season this year, but Head
Coach Barry Streeter will
begin his 20th year at the
Bullet helm. It all began
Monday when 93
candidates reported for the
first day of pre-season
drills. Streeter is currently
the college's all-time
coaching leader with 108
victories, 80 losses and five
draws. His best season was
1985 when he guided the
Bullets through their only
undefeated regular season

and eventually completed
the year with a 11-1-1 slate
following a semi-final
placing in the NCAA
Division III playoffs.
Streeter added three
new coaches to his staff of
eight. Steve Reider, a 1995
Dickinson graduate, and
Tom Waranavage, a 1993
Muhlenberg grad, have
been assigned to the wide
receivers and tight ends
respectively. The new
outside linebacker coach is
Marty Ogle, a 1974
graduate of Sheperd.
Among the 93
candidates Streeter will
greeted on Sunday were 49

freshmen and 44
upperclassmen, including
31 letter winners. Heading
the list is sophomore Paul
Smith. Smith, a first team
all-centennial conference
fullback as a freshman,
rushed 888 yards and
scored nine touchdowns in
1996. He has been named
on of USA III Football's
top sophomores to watch in
1997. Leading the Bullets
in 1997 will be elected
captains Joe Hodakowski
and Rob Sena.
Hodakowski is a senior
linebakcer while Sena is a
senior defensive back.

The one nice thing
facing Streeter is the fact
that he has a solid starting
veteran at every position
except offensive left guard.
With an offensive line
intact, backed by an
experienced backfield, the
Bullets could unleash a
potent offense. Veterans
Chris Fugaro and Wes
Wells are back at
quarterback while veterans
Matt Helwig and Donny
McNellis will be at the
halfback slots. Joining
Smith at the fullback slot
will be another veteran,
Henry Unger, as well as the
return of Dan Sheats.

Sheats took a year off last
season for personal
reasons, after rushing for
273 yards and one
touchdown in five games as
a freshman in 1995.
The Bullets spent
the first two days going
through physicals,
equipmentadjustments,
testing and meetings. It has
been down to business ever
since with tow-a-day
sessions.
Gettysburg will
open its season on
Saturday, Sept. 13 at
Hampden-Sydney.

Football kicks off 105th season

Bullets sixth in Conference

LANCASTER, Pa.
-Can the dream continue in
Collegeville? Apparently
the coaches and SIDs in the
Conference think so.
Ursinus, which won
its first-ever Conference
football championship in
1996, is the favorite to
repeat as Centennial
Conference football
champion in a poll of the
Conference's head coaches
and media. Each head

coach and Sports
Information Director from
each Conference locale
participated in the poll.
The Bears received
eight of a possible 15 first
place votes (voters were
not permitted to vote for
their own team) for 81
points to outdistance
Franklin & Marshall, which
was second with 66 points.
Ursinus returns 15 starters
and 59 lettermen from last
season's 9-2 team which

I¦s
3

was ousted in the NCAA
playoffs by Lycoming, 31
24. The Diplomats,
which finished second to
the Bears in the '96
standings, barely
outpointed Johns Hopkins
(64), Dickinson (63), and
Western Maryland (60), in
one of the closest preseason
ballotings in the
Conference's 15 year
history. F&M received
three first place votes,
while Western Maryland
picked up two. Johns
Hopkins and Dickinson
were on the top line in one
ballot apiece.

Gettysburg was
sixth with 49 points, while
Muhlenberg (22) and
Swathmore (15) rounded
out the field.
The Centennial
openers are set for Sept. 19
-20, when Gettysburg will
host Western Maryland.

Men s LaX struggles to put season behind them
Bullets fall to Washington after less than perfect sea son

From Staf fRepor ts
When the Gettys
burg College men's
lacrosse team lost three
consecutive games to
Salisbury State, Western
Maryland, and Washing
ton midway through the
season to fall to 5-4,- the
possibility that the
Bullets might miss the
NCAA Division III

tournament for the first
time since 1990 looked
very real.
Head Coach Hank
Janczyk's squad re
sponded by wining the
final five games of the
regular season, earning a
bid to the Division III
playoffs. In the first
round, Gettysburg
knocked off Salisbury
State in double overtime,

10-9. The Bullets' season
came to a close when
they fell to Washington
in the semifinals, 10-9.
"Every once in a
while I guess you have a
season that demonstrates
how certain cliches get
started," said Janczyk,
who has now logged 10
seasons as the head
coach at Gettysburg. "I
probably used phrases
like 'keep believing' and
