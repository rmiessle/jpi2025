Lambda Chi Alpha to become student housing
Fraternity leaves house due to financial woes

by Laura Root
Staff Reporter The house that
has belonged to the
Lambda Chi Alpha fra
ternity for years is set
to become student
housing next year. It
will stay that way for
the next two to five
years. According to
College administra
tors, fanancial troubles
and the fraternity's
small size contributed
to the decision to lease
the house.
Two years ago,
the Lambda Chi house,
located on West Broad
way, went through
some major renova
tions. To pay for these
renovations, a loan had
to be taken out.

Because of the
loan, the brotherhood
is in debt. To pay back
the debt, the Alumni
Corporation of
Lambda Chi (who
owns the house) decided
be in the best interest of

to lease their house.
The house will be leased to the
College for a maximum of five years.
At the end of each year, the fraternity
has the option to buy out the house's
occupants and move into the house the
following year.

According to Assistant Dean of
the College and Director of Greek Or
ganizations, Dennis Murphy, the
fraternity's return to their house could
take anywhere from two to five years.
The house will be open to the
brothers for receptions and meetings
during Alumni and Homecoming
Weekends.

Current chapter president, An
thony Futia insisted that the fraternity
will remain active on campus, and
hoped to move the brothers back into
the house "in the shortest possible time."
Murphy said that the house will
most likely become Honors Housing
next year. To prepare for its new resi
dents, the house will undergo some mi¬

nor renovations in
cluding a new paint
job. The use of the
Lambda Chi house
for student housing
will help to alleviate
the current housing
shortage on campus,
which has increased
the number of stu
dents living off cam
pus. The College
has current plans to
reduce the number
of students living off
campus to 200 by
the year 2000 (see
article on page 4).
Until they re
turn to the house,
Lambda Chi broth
ers will be living in
residence halls on
campus. During this
time, it will be a
"non-residential fra
ternity," where
brothers attend fra-

house.
Currently, the Lambda Chi Alpha
fraternity has 18 members. According
to Dean Murphy, that is not a large
enough membership to continue as a
brotherhood. But beyond the issue of
membership, the greater problem that
Lambda Chi faces is sustaining increas
ing costs of living while they remain in
a large amount of debt.

College in Baltimore, has been
named the Henry R. Luce Pro
fessor of the Civil War Era at
Gettysburg College. The first
person to be named to this
newly established position,
Gallman will begin teaching
and administrative duties of the
position in the fall.
Gallman was selected
for the post after an extensive
national search. The College

was awarded a six year grant
of approximately $600,000 last
year from the Henry Luce
Foundation to establish a pro
fessorship in the Civil War era.
Gallman will lead an under
graduate program in Civil War
studies and will develop and
direct "The Gettysburg Semes
ter," a program through which
college students from across
the country will come to
Gettysburg College for a se
mester of intensive interdisci
plinary study of the Civil War

era. "This

Assistant News Editor
Dr. Hans Mark, Chair
man of the Board of Trustees
of the Barry M. Goldwater
Scholarship and Excellence in
Education Foundation, re
cently announced that the
Trustees have awarded 316
scholarships for the 1998-99
school year to undergraduate
sophomores and juniors from
the fifty states.
Jay L. Henniger, a jun
ior physics and mathematics
major at Gettysburg College,
was one of the recipients.
Henniger, a native of Seattle,
Washington, has studied exten
sively in the fields of as
tronomy, with Dr. Larry
Marshall, and combinatorial
mathematics, under Dr. Bela
Bajnok.

Henniger is an active
member of the Society of Phys
ics Students and the Math
ematical Association of
America. In January, Henniger
and his partner Andy Danner
received Honorable Mention at
the student poster session at the

national MAA meeting in Bal
timore. The Goldwater Schol
ars were selected on the basis
of academic merit from a field
of 1,186 mathematics, science,
and engineering students who
were nominated by the facul
ties of colleges and universities
nationwide. One hundred and
eighty-three of the Scholars are
men, 133 are women, and vir
tually all intend to obtain a
Ph.D in their respective areas
of study. Nineteen scholars are
mathematics majors, 215 are
science majors, 20 are major
ing in engineering, and 62 have
dual majors in a variety of
mathematics, science, engineer
ing and computing disciplines
The one and two year
scholarships will cover the cost
of tuition, fees, books, and
room and board up to a maxi
mum of $7,500 per year.

The Scholarship Pro
gram honoring Senator Barry
M. Goldwater was designed to
foster and encourage outstand
ing students to pursue careers
in the fields of mathematics,

science and engineering. The
Goldwater Scholarship is the
premier undergraduate award
of its type in these fields.
The Foundation, now
in its tenth year, has, to date,
awarded 2,407 scholarships
worth approximately twenty
five million dollars. The Trust
ees plan to award about three
hundred scholarships for the
1999-2000 academic year.

College close to obtaining $48 million bond
Funds to pay for construction of new student housing

by Henry Fawell
Assistant News Editor
Gettysburg College is on
the verge of obtaining a $48
million bond issue from the
Gettysburg Municipal Author
ity, following a 6-2 borough
council vote Monday.
The bond will be used by
the College mainly to help fi
nance construction of new
buildings and the renovations
oi old ones. As a result, the
College hopes to minimize the
number of students living off
campus.
Members of the Hazel

Alley Association, an organiza
tion formed by area residents
to deal with off-campus hous
ing problems, have requested a
commitment from the College
that the number of students liv
ing offcampus be reduced to
200 by the upcoming fall se
mester.
Gordon Haaland, presi
dent of the College, has yet to
comply to this commitment,
despite college efforts to lower
the number by reducing admis
sions next fall and adding 150
on-campus beds by 2000.
The college's plans in
clude the construction of a new

science facility, which would
then open up dorm space, as
the present science building
would be converted into col
lege housing.
The College has already
made some immediate efforts
to alleviate the housing prob
lem. The purchase of a prop
erty on North Washington
Street and the lease of the
Lambda Chi fraternity house
(see front page) are some of
these efforts.
While the borough was
pleased by the efforts, their
overriding concern was the
college's plan to curb the un¬

civil behavior of some of its stu
dents. In an article run by The
Gettysburg Times President
Haaland said, "We have a di
lemma. We invite a group of
intelligent, ambitious young
people. They are teenagers, but
college is a time of change. We
need to use appropriate re
straints and still understand
that young people are differ
ent." These restraints may in
clude programs designed to fa
miliarize students with life
within the community, and an
orientation program for stu¬

dents who plan to live off-cam
pus. The borough council is
also doing its part to quell stu
dent behavior. An ordinance is
being discussed among the pub
lic safety Committee that would
require landlords to regulate
the behavior of student tenants.
Some behavioral prob
lems mentioned by residents
have been excessive porch fur
niture and students sunbathing
on roofs.
Concerning the council's
demands on the college, one
Gettysburg resident told The
Gettysburg Times, "If nothing
else, we got their attention."

Lukewarm L Baltimore

by George Spelvin
Contributing Reviewer
The Hot L Baltimore, the
Owl and Nightingale Players
spring production by Lanford
Wilson, is a play about a once
elegant hotel left to rot along
with its tenants until finally it
is set to be demolished. This
description does not describe
the production, and I think
that, with a couple of excep
tions, the presentation was an
elaborate success.
Directed by George
Muschamp, the gritty, realistic
drama t came to life. No easy
script to direct, Muschamp
handled the blocking brilliantly.
Everyone on stage had much
"business," yet nothing was dis
tracting. His direction of the
final fight scenes at the ends of
Acts I and II began minimally
and then little by little he added

tension; the pattern of crosses

increased the stress level and
finally the big explosion ar¬

rived. I do question the open
ing tableau. For me, it left
something unfinished. I ex
pected perhaps a da capo fin
ish or some reason for the ac
tors to be in those specific
places. In a show that is 100%
realistic, the freeze just didn't
make sense.
I also had a problem with
the third act. Now, this is not
the fault of the director or any
of the actors, but of Lanford
Wilson's. One word sums up
the final act—anticlimactic.
After the fight at the end of Act
II between Morse, Jackie, and
Katz, to have such a "blah" act
can only mean poor writing.
Additionally, some of the
loose ends seemed untied.
What will happen to everyone

in the hotel after the demoli
tion? Who knows?
The rest of the play, how
ever, was full of conflict, ten
sion, and interesting dialogue.
Also, the theme, as Muschamp
puts it in the program, of the
threatening demise of human
spontaneity appropriately ap
plies to today.
As far as the visual ele
ments, the set designed by Brian
Hershfeld was, in a word, fan
tastic. I felt as though I was
actually in a ' hotel lobby. The
detail work of the stairs, ' the
marbling, the-_^flats, etc., im
pressed me immensely. Kudos
to Anne Semple for her set
decoration. One thing did
bother me, for it _seamed quite
out of place —the mural on the
stage left catwalk. Although
drawn and painted well, it just
conflicted with the other set el
ements.

The lighting, also de
signed by Mr. Hershfeld,
worked efficiently. It was un
obtrusive and nondistracting.
However, the fade ins and outs
occurred a bit too slowly, al
lowing the audience's attention
to wander. Thank goodness for
the music; otherwise the audi
ence would have been far too
gone during the changes.
The costuming was ap
propriate, as was most of the
makeup. April (Mary Cordero)
could have used a bit more age
makeup, however.
The acting was Very good
as well. Not one cast member
really could qualify as miscast
or as a "bad actor." Overall,
the actors handled the difficult
timing with success at most
points. All were very believ
able in the massive fight scene
at the end of act one.
However, as with any

production, there were some
standouts. Duncan Niederer as
Mr. Morse knew exactly what
he was doing. More impres
sive than his speaking lines was
his ability to just sit around
during Act III. It takes great
concentration to act when say
ing nothing, and he certainly
deserves applause for his silent
performance in that final act.
Additionally, I loved his
checker-fight with Jaime (Paul
Lapato).
Brad Cerilli as Bill Lewis
also performed well. His fa
cial expressions were excellent.
He had the most stage business
of any of the actors and not
once could I say he was dis
tracting or unrealistic.

Reel Hits & Misses _ T r . A
Falling Angels

by Dan Larktn and Mike Petro
Movie Columnists
Do you believe in angels?
Maybe you do or maybe you
don't. Perhaps your faith
might tell stories of angels and
you take their existence on
faith, and perhaps you just
think it is all just myths and
fairy tales.
Angels are certainly all
the rage these days. They're on
all sorts of pins and bumper
stickers, and there's that annoy
ing TV show that my mom likes
so much. So, I fi gured that City
of Angels would be yet another
f oray into pop spirituality.
The new movie City of
Angels takes a look at the an
gels of our world. According
to the story, angels are all
around us and even though we
cannot see them, they are al
ways there. They hear music
in the sunrise, feel no pain or
other human emotions, can
read anyone's mind, and are

messengers of God. These di
vine beings operate around us
all the time.
One such messenger,
Seth, turns up one day during
a heart surgery that has gone
wrong. During the trauma of
the moment, the chief surgeon,
Dr. Maggie Rice, played by
Meg Ryan (Joe vs. the Volcano,
Amityville 3-D) while working
feverishly on her dying patient,
sees Seth in the room and hears
him too. The patient dies; Seth
had come for him.
Maggie, confused and
bewildered, ends up in a stair
well sobbing, thoughts of what
went wrong spinning in her
head, and as she cries, Seth is
there, longing to reveal himself
to her, yet knowing nothing of
what he feels inside.

This turns out to be the
telling moment of the film: it
is where Seth, played with
charm and charisma by Nicho
las Cage (Zandalee, Trapped in
Paradise), falls in love with

Maggie.
Cage is one of my favor
ite actors, though he's been
slumming since Leaving Las
Vegas, but even his mediocre
performances are pretty good.
He does an okay job in this
movie, but he doesn't act so
much as stare soulfully at Meg
Ryan throughout the movie.
Troubled by his thoughts
of love, and intrigued by the
interaction he wants to have
with Maggie, Seth seeks coun
sel with his partner of sorts,
Cassiel, played by Homicide's
Andr e Braugher. Seth learns
of the ability for an angel to
"fall" to earth and become hu¬

man. This part reminded me a
lot o/"Superman II, when Clark
gives up his powers in order to
have a relationship with Lois.
And Nick Cage will be playing
Superman in a new movie next
year. Ah, the irony.
The rest of the movie fo
cuses around the conflict of

emotions between the two
main characters and the
struggle each has with their
emotions. Both are assisted in
understanding by Nathaniel
Messinger, a fallen angel him
self, played extremely well by
Dennis Franz (Sipowicz!), a joy
in a often sad movie.
I'm a big fan of Dennis
Franz on NYPD Blue, but I was
worried when I saw that he was
in this, we wouldn't see his na
ked butt. I shouldn 't have wor
ried. He does a pretty good job
with the acting.
This is a well put to
gether, if not sometimes sappy
love story. I love the visual
imagery of the movie and I like
the conceptualization of what
an angel is. I think it works as
a romance and as a means to
spiritual exploration.

The actors are very good
together as well. Franz and
Braugher give solid perfor
mances that are reflective of
their excellent talents, and

Cage and Ryan are both excel
lent in their own right.
The visuals of this movie
are very impressive. I liked the
scenes with the angels on the
rooftops. It wasn't over-the-top
special effects wizardry, like
Fifth Element (about which I
might have been a little over
zealous in an earlier statement
I made about the Oscars), but
just really nice camera shots.
This is a very watchable
film and I found myself liking
it very much. For a good,
thought provoking and roman
tic movie to cleanse your pal
ate before the summer explo
sion fest, see City of Angels*
Three and a half out of five

stars. I can't say that I found
this movie thought-provoking
It made me sad. I guess you
could call it tear-provoking?
Though fairly predictable, City
of Angels is a nice romantic
tear-jerker. Two and seven
eighths stars (out of five).

80's Brat Pack flick provokes laughter and thought

In Case You Missed It

by Eileen O'Donnell
Movie Columnist
What happens when five
teenagers are locked together
in a library for a whole Satur
day? John Hughes' moving tale
about teen angst, The Breakfast
Club, asks this question.
Starring Molly Ringwald
(Pretty in Pink, Sixteen
Candles), Emiho Estevez
(Maximum Overdrive), Ally
Sheedy (Maid to Order), An
thony Michael Hall (Weird Sci
ence), and Judd Nelson (TV's

Suddenly Susan), The Breakfast
Club was released at the height
of Brat Pack fame. These five
stars were the stock actors and
actresses for adolescent films of
the early to mid 1980's.
Ringwald and Hall starred to
gether in Sixteen Candles.
Nelson, Sheedy, and Estevez
were all together again in St.
Elmo's Fire, which also starred
Rob Lower, Andi MacDowell_,
Demi Moore, and Andrew
McCarthy.
An emotionally complex

film, The Breakfast Club has
very little action. The setting
is a Saturday detention in the
library of Shermer High School

i n
Shermer, I
Illinois.
The five
students,
Andy Clark,
the Jock I
(Estevez);
Brian
Johnson,
the Brain
(Hall);
John Bender,
the Criminal (Nelson);
Claire

Standish, the Princess
(Ringwald); and Allison
Reynolds, the Basket Case
(Sheedy), are required to write
an essay saying who they think
they are.
On the surface, The
Breakfast Club is a movie about

five kids who are serving de
tention for breaking various
rules. On this level, the movie
elicits both laughter and tears

as the students antagonize the
detention monitor, Mr. Vernon
(Paul Gleason_, the nemesis of
Eddie Murphy and Dan
Aykroyd in Trading Places) and
each other.
On a much deeper level,
Hughes explores stereotypes,

generalizations, and confor
mity. He attempts to make
sense of a teenager's need to fit
in and be accepted by his or her
peers.

Not
only
does
Hughes
explore
the atti
tudes of
teenag
ers to
wards
their
peers,
but he
also ex
amines the rela
tionships of teens
The film

with their parents.
begins with each kid being
dropped off by his or her par
ents. Interestingly, Brian's
mother is played by Hall's real
mother, Mercedes Hall. And
making a cameo as Brian's fa
ther is Hughes.

Mr. Vernon, meanwhile,
sees the students under his care
in the broadest terms and in the
most convenient categories, not
for the people they are.
Hughes directed many "of
the Brat Pack films that we can
all remember. He is respon
sible for Sixteen Candles, Pretty
in Pink, Ferris Bueller's Day
Off, Some Kind of Wonderful,
and Weird Science.
Hughes has also directed
National Lampoon's Vacation,
European Vacation, and Christ
mas Vacation, as well as Uncle
Buck, Mr. Mom, The Great
Outdoors, and Home Alone 1
3. The film is full of honest
feelings, and the dialogue is
brutally frank. The Breakfast
Club is one of those rare films
that makes you think, but
makes you laugh at the same
time.

If you take anything away
from this movie, remember
this: "Screws fall out all the
time; the world's an imperfect
place." -John Bender

GECO winners

The results from
G.E.C.O.'s first annual Poetry
and Essay Contest are in, and
the winners are: first place, a
$50 gift certificate to the Blue
Parrot, goes to sophomore
Ashley Binter; second place, a
$20 gift certificate to K&K
Records, goes to junior Julie
Ann Calamaras; and third
place, a G.E.C.O. mug, goes to
senior Stephanie Sellars.
Thanks to everyone who en
tered! Also, thanks to the Envi
ronmental Science Department
and Student Senate for helping
judge the contest.
Our third place winner,
Stephanie, agreed to have her
entry published in the paper, so
here it is:

thing catches my eye.
A black form, a few feet
to my right, sits in the sand. 1
approach the figure and I can
see that it moves, awkwardly
No, it hobbles, crippled. As 1
get closer, it tries to move away
but it can't; it struggles as if the
beach has suddenly become
quicksand.
I am close enough to see
what it is now, a creature of the
air, imprisoned on the earth by
a blackness, cruel and unnatu
ral. Her eyes are shut, glued
by the black goo that separates
her feathers into stiff spikes,
like a porcupine, but these
spikes are no defense mecha
nism; they are an encumbrance,
rather, heavy chains that pre
vent her from taking flight as
she was born to do.

It's still a beautiful day
Blue sky, hardly a cloud, but the
sun screams Icarus. I imagine
how that boy must have felt,
trying to defy nature with his
foolish wings. Invincible. But
he died of natural causes. This
bird, however, may never reach
the sun again. She will not
melt, but she may suffocate in
the black stains deposited by
the Icaruses of the earth.
I reach out, and pick up
the black, sticky mass of plum
age, as a tear falls from my sun
blocked face and mixes with
the sympathetic salt of the
ocean.

It's a beautiful day. Blue
sky, hardly a cloud, and a sun
that screams Helios. The UV
rays brighten every melancholy
face. A perfect day for the
beach. So I pack my 100% UV
resistant sunglasses and a bottle
of 15 SPF: skin cancer preven
tion fluid. As I walk along the
water's edge, black sand sticks
to my feet. I forgot my all
natural cork flip-flops. I wade
into the water to wash off the
gritty oil. While scraping the
sewage from my feet with a
piece of broken glass, some-

Memones

Junction was called the Dive.
I remember when the li
ons at SAE had noses!
I remember when ' frater
nities had parties three nights a
week. I remember when I was a
freshman, the real world didn't
look quite as scary.
Chrissy Shott: I think one
of my many fond memories of
Gettysburg College was know
ing Casey Dunn. She brought
joy to the hearts of all who
knew her, and kindness to those
she encountered. I miss my
bond with her as a friend, sis
ter, fellow student, and close
confidant.

Buhrman. I remember one
time when he wanted to de
frost the fridge, so he got out
a screwdriver and hammer to
chip away the ice. Jn doing so,
he struck the gas line and was
propelled backwards into the
bathroom! We watched the
geyser of freon for a few min
utes, then he thought that
freon would give him cancer,
so he left. I opened a window.
I remember the time
WZBT whupped the crap out
of the Gettysbursian in chair

races. Greg Eckblom: My most
memorable experience of col
lege was living with Scott
Buhrman.
Mike Wooden: My most
memorable experience of col
lege was living with Stinky
Buhrman.
Rebecca Babbitt: One
memory is of when a fraternity
boy--"Corey"~crossed my best
friend, Kate. Kate and I de
cided to get even by removing
all of his clothing from his
closet and drawers. His room
mate told us which clothes
were Corey's. We walked right
out of the house with a
trashbag full of clothes during
a party and nobody said a
thing! We got an angry phone
call the next morning from the
roommate; he had pointed out
his own clothes and didn't
have any underwear!

Jaime Foanio: One of my
funniest memories has to be my
trip to Cancun for spring break
my sophomore year. We got
there and did not have a hotel.
We fought for a place to stay
and ended up in this really
creepy place. We were walked
up to our rooms with candles,
no other lighting. The next day
we fought hard and ended up
with a room at another hotel;
of course it was about $100
cheaper than what we actually
paid. To compensate, they sent
us a free weekend stay at the
hotel. I'm don't think I will be
going back there anytime

soon...

dame with style. She was com
pletely believable and executed
her lines with a comic grace
unlike any other. I would ditch
the wig, though.
Samantha Gregg per
formed the role of Jackie, a
tough New York lesbian. In this
role, her versatility as an actress
took her far. She completely
inhabited the character in
voice, posture, movement, and
mind. This was some of the
best acting I have ever seen, not
only from her, but on the Kline
Stage. Allison Kennedy as the
obnoxious Mrs. Oxenham left
me wanting more of her char
acter. She was funny to watch
and delivered her lines with her
unique comic flair.

Alec Beekmans as the ho
tel manager Mr. Katz gave a
fine performance. It looked as
though the blood vessels in his
neck were about to burst.
Finally, Mary Cordero as
April played the sarcasm quite
well. She had the audience
cracking up with her pan-face
delivery of her most humerous
lines, many of which I can't
repeat.
Although the show was

Senior Staff Reflections
_WgBecca % ( BaB6itt

Four years ago an inno
cent, optimistic young girl
moved into the basement of
Hanson Hall, eager to begin
her college career. Next week
a bitter, sarcastic woman will
graduate from here, eager to
move on.
When I was asked to
write this Senior Reflection
last week, I automatically as
sumed that I would use these
last few-hundred words to get
my final revenge, to blast all
that I dislike and to bid a fi
nal farewell to this asinine life.
But, I have done enough
of that over the past four
years. I have made enough
enemies and lost enough
friends.
Instead, I would like to
take this space to thank those
people who have positively
affected my college career. It
will read like an Academy
Awards speech, but I feel it is
important to publicly ac¬

knowledge those people who
have made a difference.
First, there are many
friends and acquaintances who I
want to mention. It is often said
that most of the learning done
in college takes place outside of
the classroom. Without these
friends, I fear I would have
learned very little. I want to rec
ognize Kate Naughton, for read
ing my mind and always listen
ing to me; Laura Garncarz, who
taught me the wonders of the
Chicken Truck; Joanna Bucci,
for always making me laugh;
Amy Sedor, for going to break
fast with me all those times;
Laura Benicasa, who helped me
through some of the hardest
times; Susannah Kopcho, for just
being herself. I also want to
thank Hutch, Mike Wooden,
Corey Ehrenworth, Julie
Wilmer, Colleen Gormley, Erica
Duchnowski, Mark Gorman and
Andrew Spitilari, who are all
wonderful people and good

friends.
Teaching is a noble occu
pation; unfortunately, there are
few people who fulfill the re
quirements of being a great
teacher. I have been lucky to
know some of the professors
who are brilliant, not only in
their field of study, but also as
teachers. Some of these people
are Dr. Charles "Buzz" Myers,
who taught me to think for
myself and to value my ideas;
Dr. Timothy Shannon, from
whom I learned that good
enough is never good enough;
and Dr. Jack Ryan, whose pa
tience, understanding, and sup
port are enough to nominate
him for sainthood. I also must
take time to appreciate some
administrators, namely, Anne
Lane in Academic Advising,
Julie Ramsey and Tim Rupe in
College Life, and Assistant
Chaplain Bill Gohl. These men
and women have taught
through demonstration what a

good leader and confidant
should be.
And then there are those
who have already gone.
Former Pastor Nadine Lehr was
an important influence in my
life. She taught me that you can
get pissed off and still be a good
Christian. Will Siss ('94) and
Brett Forshey, Eric Chalek, and
Jeannie Welch ('97) challenged
me to think for myself and just
have a good time. Most nota
bly however, is Casey Dunn,
who taught me how to laugh
at myself.
I need not mention the
importance of the Gettysburg
ian to me over the last four
years. The many people who
have served on the staff have
put up with me and my mood
swings with grace and dirty
jokes. They have always chal
lenged me to see the big pic
ture and to "fight injustice, to
right that which is wrong and
to serve all mankind!"

I must also acknowledge
my sisters in Alpha Xi Delta,
without whom I would be
nothing. I hope they know
how much I love them.
Last, but far from least, I
thank my family: my mother
and father who have always
stood by me and loved me,
even when I messed up and dis
appointed them. They taught
me well and have given me all
that I desire; my sister, Bryanne
(a.k.a. Flakes) who has been
just as much a friend as a sis
ter; my grandmother, who I
admire for her hard work and
dedication to her family, and
my grandfather, who reads ev
ery word of this newspaper ev
ery week. I love you!
I know that this has been
sappy, but it needed to be said.
My life has been enriched by
knowing these people. Please,
don't wait until your senior
year to start appreciating those
around you.

Jason Hatheway

"Just throw the ball over
the plate this time ya yutz!"
Hateway clamored as he
swung the Wiffle Ball bat back
and forth over the imaginary
plate that was really only a
worn place in the grass where
they had stood for the whiffle
ball game the day before.
They were playing along the
backside of the College
Chapel which had a giant
brick cross imbedded in the
three story wall. This was
what the hitter was supposed
to aim at to score points. The
system was complicated and
new rules always had to be
made to make up for discrep
ancies. It seemed sacrilegious
to smack a ball against the
back side of a chapel, espe
cially on a Sunday when there
was a service inside.

Eric just looked intently
as he pitched the plastic ball
covered with electrical tape
towards the "plate". "Swing
at something!"
"Throw it over the

plate." "Swing at something."
"Throw it over the plate."
"Look. I am up by seven
points, so just swing." Eric
looked exasperated. Apparently
he was looking forward to a meal
of rice products and Bisquick
Biscuits that had been made two
days before and the thirty tons
of hot dogs that he had shuffled
off during a victimized school
picnic. In truth, the boys had be
come experts at the scrounge. It
had started when the year before

was spent in Servo carrying
plates of chicken fingers, which
were the equivalent to finding
gold, to a plastic bag and then
carrying about twenty pounds of
these delectables in a covert op
eration back to the apartment
where they would eat dinner
while watching them Duke boys
out maneuver Fatty Whites and
Crony Cop. From there it had
led to even greater exploits in
cluding frequent raids on depart
ment picnics.
Well, the Redman was

starting to taste bad. Actually
they couldn't taste it at all.
Hateway's mouth was so numb
from the chew that he was slur
ring his words. He knew that
if he didn't get rid of the taste
by that night he would prob
ably drool on his pillow. All of
a sudden food sounded very
good to him. Any attempt to
see if his taste buds were still
functioning seemed much more
important than waiting for the
ideal pitch.
"I quit."

"You should."
"Okay, let's eat. C'mon."
Back at the apartment
they were once again made
aware of the fact that there was
not one kitchen utensil that was
clean except the sponge. The
plates had been there for God
knows how long. Eric and
Brett, the proprietors of Tudor
six, attempted at all costs to
avoid the mess. They had
hoped with people like
Hateway and others always us
ing the apartment for their per¬

sonal playground that these
people would sooner or later
clean it for them. They were
often right. The sink was gur
gling and if one tried to put
their head within a three foot
radius of the sink, it was obvi
ous that something was decay
ing in there.
Eric opened the fridge.
The sink would once again be
left to its own devices.
"Hot dog?" Eric yelled
from the fridge.
"Yeah, and grab me a bis¬

cuit too." So much for rice.
They went out on the
back porch with hot dogs
speared on plastic forks and
crumbling stale biscuits in the
other hand. The porch was a
fire escape and the area be
tween the metal slats allowed
the food that did not make it
into the mouth to fall onto the
wood deck of the neighbors
below. All of a sudden it was
their problem; if they didn't
clean it up it was their fault if
their porch became a feeding

ground for the carnivorous
squirrels in the area.
Although they were on
the shady side of the building
they could see the sunset re
flecting off the sides of the
buildings as they ate in silence.
Hateway finished his hot dog
and realized that he was prob
ably going to be sick if he didn't
get the taste out of his mouth.
The biscuit had no moisture in
it and only the saliva that was
forming from the aftertaste of
the chew was allowing him to

digest it. He lit a cigarette and
offered one to Eric who took
it and, as Hateway expected,
puffed on it without inhaling.
It just hung from his lips.
Hateway inhaled his cigarette
and felt the food he had just
eaten hit the lower regions of
his stomach. The wind picked
up a little and they felt the qui
etness only pierced by the J
brake of the trucks a few streets
away. It was all so simple, easy
and wonderful. At the very
least, it was ideal.

Senior Staff Reflections
AANIEA AAPKIN

People like me who re
member when the Junction was
called the Dive, and when the
Honor Code had a semicolon
instead of a comma are fast
becoming in short supply
around here, so as closing time
approaches, I guess it's only
natural to look back and reflect
on the past four years.
I stood at The Gettys
burgian table at Get Acquainted
Day last weekend "getting ac
quainted" with people I'll never
get to know. As I met and
spoke with some of these soon
to-be first years, I was made
hopeful. A lot of these kids
seemed enthusiastic and ex
cited to be coming to college,
eager to become involved. I
was jealous, jealous not to be
able to know and work with
these people, and jealous of the

opportunity that lay before
them. But just when something
like that happens to make me
upset to be leaving this place, I
have the eggs splattered on my
door by my rowdy neighbors
and the obnoxious freshmen in
my softball class to make me
think otherwise.
But then I think of how
good I have it right now. I will
never be able to live so pam
pered a lifestyle again. I will
never live in such close prox
imity to my closest friends in
all the world again. I will never
again be able to obtain a meal
merely by producing a little
plastic card. I probably won't
be able to sleep until eleven
o'clock so much anymore ei
ther. And I won't be able to
schedule my life around The
Simpsons.

For all the little things
about Gettysburg that piss me
off on a fairly regular basis,
there's so much I'm going to
miss about this place.
I'm going to miss my
close friends, of course. But I'll
stay in touch with them. I'm
not worried about that. But
what I'm going to miss most is
the friends that I probably
won't see after graduation.
Members of my classes, people
from my first-year residence
hall, friends who I've drifted
apart from- my casual friends,
who I'll never see again.
I'm going to miss this
newspaper. Staying up 'till
some ungodly hour, pouring
your heart and soul into a little
publication that nobody appre
ciates might not be everyone's
idea of a good time, but I can't
think of anything else I'd rather

do on Wednesday nights. It
appeals to the masochist in me,
I suppose. Despite the occa
sional inaccuracies and errors
the 'Burgian suffers from time
to time, I'm awfully proud of
it. In fact, I'm prouder of the
front page story from last April,
"Squirrel attacks student", than
just about anything I've ever
written.
I came to Gettysburg as a
quiet, shy, short-haired guy
with no idea what I was going
to do with my life. Strangely
enough, that's a pretty accurate
description of me now.
But lots of stuff has hap
pened along the way. Two ma
jors. Five roommates. Three
pairs of glasses. Two hair-col
ors. Lots of different hair
lengths. Going cornin'. Break
ing up with my high-school
girlfriend. Spanish 201. The

nudist special interest house.
My first sports-related injury.
James Joyce, Friedreich
Nietzsche, and Toni Morrison.
The professors of the English
and Philosophy departments.
The Gettysburgian. Grogan.
Fry. In some countries, rice is
bread. Todd, Sib, and Kenny
Phi Delta Crow. _Al. Leroy -
R.I.P., Petro, my favorite movie
date. Heidi. The Vons. Mon
keys, monkeys, monkeys. Meri.
Lonneke. Nelson. Kari. The
phonathon. Tyler. Little Man
Hate. Lennon and Suzie. Win
ning a t-shirt from Servo.
Ambro. Carol. Marsupials and
monotremes. My (now
broken) streak of staying until
the end ever Wednesday. Eric
and Brett's opening day party.
Becca, Barb, Melodie, Pepper,
Spicer, and Sara. Wee wee ra
dio. Batman's a scientist. Molly.

As I sit here to pen my fi
nal words to Gettysburg Col
lege, I am forced to reflect
upon who I have become in the
past four years. While this is
something that I think about
daily, I never really thought I
would be putting it on paper.
Thanks to The Gettys
burgian for giving me the plat
form to speak my mind, play
with voices, and voice my cyni
cism. Also, special thanks to
everyone down in that office.
You have given me so many
fond memories, Wednesday
nights will never be the same
in my life again.
I came to college as an
idealistic, yet admittedly nar
row-minded individual. I
thought that I knew everything,
and I was sure that I could share
that omnipotence with every
one. What I soon came to find

out is that I knew very little. I
was miserable in my first
months at Gettysburg. I may

and of my home town, but
what I didn't know was how to
adjust myself to the new life of
college.
Thankfully, I finally
ended up with a close group of
friends, and we have remained,
through thick and thin, closely
knit. I will miss them all and
truly hope we remain in touch
as the years drift on. Of the
things that I will miss most, one
is staying up until sunrise, talk
ing with a small group of
friends, no one wanting to
leave for fear they would miss
something. To me, that exem
plifies the college experience.
Another fond memory
that I have is of the particularly
friendly staffs of facilities,
health, safety and security, and
dining services. I can tell you
that the friendliness of both

these respective organizations
on campus did not go unno
ticed. Although it is not said
enough, I thank all of you for

p
joyable experience.
I have taken full advan
tage of the liberal arts educa
tion here at Gettysburg, sam
pling from most of the depart
ments and participating in a
variety of activites. If you are
a first year and you are reading
this, please heed my words:
don't let the opportunities
Gettysburg has to offer pass
you by. And if you have been
here for two or three years, it
is never too late. Go out and
try something new, go abroad,
go on a service learning project,
do an internship or anything
else that gets you off campus!
You will never truly appreciate
all that Gettysburg gives you
until you step away.

However, my experience
here was not all positive. In my
time here I have been exposed
to the truths that our peers rape
and are raped, take their own
lives, suffer horrific injury and

, often
than I wanted to admit, act
without consideration given to
anyone else other than them
selves.
Moreover, I learned that
sometimes, even when you are
right, you fight city hall and
lose. To the administration of
this college, my college, you
screwed up badly with the ten
ure debacles of the past year.
The tenure system here is se
verely flawed, and without re
vision it will continue to drag
down the quality of the educa
tional product that this institu
tion has to offer.
And to my professors, I
thank all of you, especially ev
ery professor that ever took the
time to get to know me.

To Professor DeClair,
thank you for being the con
summate teacher, and for push
ing me to do my best work. My
only regret is that I didn't push
until the last. You gave your all
every day for your students; I

wish I had done the same for
you. If one of life's lessons
crystallized as a result of this
all, it was to never give up on
that which you truly believe in.
Finally, to Professor
Borock, I offer my sincerest
thanks and gratitude. I heard
all the horror stories and they
were all wrong. I know I
couldn't have found a better
advisor, mentor, and friend in
the faculty here at Gettysburg.
I thank you on behalf of all my
fellow students, you are a true
friend to the students here.
This college as a whole
has been good to me, and I shall
always look back upon my four
years here with great fondness.
As I prepare to move onward
to a new chapter of life, it is
with a mix of excitement and

sadness. Thanks to Gettysburg
College and the people who
touched my life for preparing
me to always strive for great
ness. I will.

The realities of sexual assault

Sexual Assault Aware
ness week was the result of
the work of a group of stu
dents, faculty, and support
staff who recognize that our
campus is not immune to the
problems of the world, and
that sexual assault is one of
these problems. Sexual as
sault is a tradition here at
Gettysburg, and that tradi
tion is continuing.
This past weekend a
young woman was raped by
two men on this campus, two
men she knew well and
thought were her friends.
Two men she trusted. Two

To the Editor:

men who took that trust and
violated it - violated her.
Now they are walking
around this campus as if
nothing has happened. Per
haps one of them sits next to
you in class, or is a member
of a club with you. Perhaps
one is your fraternity
brother, or one is your best
friend. As she prepares her
self to deal with this trau
matic experience for the rest
of her life, these two men
(are they worthy to be called
men? Animals is a better
term.), are free to do this to
another woman.

There are people on
this campus who were of
fended by Sexual Assault
Awareness Week. Why?
Was there something in the
message that made you ques
tion your own actions?

Other people do not believe that
rape occurs here. Let it be said
to you all - race and economic
background do not determine
who rapes. The "fine upstand
ing well-to-do students" of Get
tysburg College are capable of
rape. Students at our campus
rape their fellow classmates.
This is a fact, whether you want
to admit it or not.
I've heard people on this
campus say that because they do
not know a woman who has
been raped, that it must not hap
pen here, or that, because few
cases have been made public, it

does not happen often. WAKE
UP! Simply because someone
chooses not to come forward to
let the campus know what has
happened to him or her, does
not mean that sexual assault is
not occurring!
And why would a woman
who has been raped want to
come forward on this campus?
Repeatedly, women who are vic
tims of sexual assault are
shunned by their friends when
they confide in them and are told
not to "rock the boat." On this
campus, it's "unpopular" to have
been raped.

But it still happens,
doesn't it? You all saw the wall
full of stories of sexual assault
in the CUB during Sexual As
sault Awareness Week-it's hap
pening, and it's happening often.
Ninety percent of all rapes
involve alcohol; as more and
more parties move off campus,

from under the watchful eyes of
security and the administration,
it is vital that we look out for
each other. How many times
have you laughed at that woman
who was so drunk she had no
idea what was going on around
her? Funny isn't it, but she is a
wonderful candidate for rape.
Go to parties with a group
of friends, and more impor
tantly, LEAVE WITH THEM.
And take those people home
who need help getting home
safely, even if you do not know
them. What you may think is
an inconvenience is really an act
of consideration, and this act
may be what keeps that person
from being raped that night.
Wouldn't you want someone to
extend that courtesy to you?

So, when you come back
to campus in the fall, talk about
sexual assault. Tell your friends,
tell the first-year students in par
ticular, that Gettysburg is not the
safe care-free environment that
we pretend it is. Let's take a
stand as a campus against these
acts of violence, and work to
eliminate them. If we continue
to ignore this madness, then we
have neglected our responsibili
ties to each other, and to those
people who have already been
victims.

Consider this.

As the seniors make their
final statements and exert their
last round of influence over
the College, and admissions
begins preparations to wel
come a new first-year class,
The Gettysburgian will take a
moment to reflect on the past
academic year.
We've reflected on many
serious and not-so-serious is
sues this semester: sexual as
sault, eating disorders, large
prehistoric creatures wreaking
havoc on campus, rowdy stu
dents wreaking havoc on cam
pus, AIDS, housing, and the
fact that our pig is still miss
ing. On a more serious note,
we would like to take a mo
ment to remember those we
have lost this year. Casey
Dunn was a bright spot in
many people's lives. She
touched everyone who knew
her, and we on The Gettys
burgian staff feel privileged
that she was one of us. She
left an impression on Gettys
burg College, and we will
never forget her.
This year has been an
eventful one. One of the ma
jor academic buildings on

campus was threatened with a
bomb, Fiona Apple didn't come,
fraternities were closed down,
Bob Dole spoke to many
(though many were turned
away). South Park found an at
tentive audience—attentive for
our generation. Campus social
events didn't revolve around fra
ternity parties, as more events
were open to the whole campus
and BYOB.
Now it's time to look to
wards next year. We'll welcome
the class of 2002 (the members
of whom are the first class to
have been born in the 1980's)
and realize just what the class of
1998 meant to us. We'll see the
places they left, and we'll look
to others to fill those places. But
the spaces held in our hearts for
them will never be filled.'

Who knows what will hap
pen next year—who will come
here, what will happen, and
where will we and our friends
end up. Is there a future presi
dent among the ranks or, per
haps a Nobel prize winner? The
future is a blank slate, and it is
up to us to fill it. Whether we
do this from Gettysburg or from
the Real World, we are the fu
ture. Go out there and grab it.

Reducing risk through behavior and education

I'm really glad to see
the 'burgian helping edu
cate students with respect
to health matters, but the
article in the April 23rd is
sue raises some serious
concerns here at the health
center.
In the 2nd paragraph
of the 2nd column, the
reader is told that "the
only way to protect your
self (from HIV) is by ab
staining from intercourse
or by you and your part
ner getting tested."
This is most certainly
not true. Although ab-

Conflict and Consensus

To the Editor

staining from sexual inter
couise MAY reduce ones risk
there are LOTS of risky sexual
behaviors that don't involve
"intercourse." In fact some of
the worst cases of sexually
transmitted disease that I've
seen are in people who have
not had intercourse. Any ex
change of blood or body flu
ids, oral, anal, or genital, is as
sociated with the risk of
infection,certainly of HIV but
also of other bloodborne dis
eases like hepatitis B.
In addition, being tested
for HIV is NOT a protective
measure. It lets one know,

within the parameters of accu
racy of the test, whether he/she
is positive or negative for anti
bodies to the virus. It is our
behavior that protects us or
puts us at risk.
Education and HIV status
give us important information
that may or may not effect our
behavior! What we need to do
is to influence readers to
change their behavior if it is
putting them, or others, at risk.

Connie Songer

They're all foreign policy presidents

by John Dunlap
Political Columnist
No matter what the po
litical background of a Presi
dent, it is the historic pattern
that chief executives make their
mark in foreign, not domestic
policy. Richard Nixon visited
China and established detente
with the Soviet Union. Gerald
Ford dealt with the fall of Viet
nam, middle east shuttle diplo
macy and Detente with the So
viets. Former Georgia gover
nor and President Jimmy

Carter concentrated on human
rights, and his greatest achieve
ment was the Camp David Ac
cord between Israel and Egypt.
President Reagan took on the
Soviet Union, and towards the
end of his presidency_^ because
they were changing, he made
peace with Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev. Finally
president George Bush was at
tacked for spending to much
time on foreign policy. , Presi
dent Bush dealt with the Per
sian Gulf War, Middle East
peace and the fall of commu¬

. As governor, Bill Clinton
attacked President Bush in
1992 for not concentrating
more on domestic policy. Now,
President Clinton has joined his
predecessors, and yes, _eyen Bill
Clinton is a foreign policy
president. Two weeks ago he
was in Africa, last week he was
in Latin America and next week
he will be in London for the G
7 Economic Summit. Early in
his first term, the new president
had trouble in the foreign

policy arena. The disaster and
outright humiliation of the
United States, as American
troops were dragged through
the _streets of Mogadishu _^ So
malia ., Bill Clinton _seepied at
home when it came tp_.calking
about the budget or health
care, not nuclear weapons or
international terrorism.
This began to change in
1995, as for the first time in
forty'years the Republican
Party took control of Congress.
The new Congress and its Con
tract with America* were not
overly concerned with the
Clinton domestic agenda. Even
if presidents cannot get their
domestic agenda through the
Congress, they have virtual
complete control of the foreign
policy agenda and policies of
the United States. I am often a

very big critic of the Clinton
_Administration but by the end
of first term, the American mis
sion, in : both Haiti i and the
_former Yugoslavia had, gone
better than,anyone expected.
The president used for
eign policy to his advantage in
the 1996 presidential cam
paign, which originally was
supposed to be a Republican
issue. Foreign policy is not as
popular of an issue as it was tin
past decades due to the Cold
War, hut jt is still an area where
presidents can get things done
without having to deal with
Congress or the Washington
bureaucracy. Foreign
policy has also been heightened
by the fact that the President's
second term Secretary of State
Madeline Albright is very ac¬

tive, unlike the very laid back
term number one Secretary of
State Warren Christopher. The
administration with Madeline
Albright has gotten more in
volved in the Middle East pro
cess and has taken a tougher
stand with Iraq and United
Nations weapons inspectors.
The President personally got
involved in the peace process
within Northern Ireland and it
paid off in the form of a peace
deal has been reached. Now
Bill Clinton, the peace-maker

is looking to get involved in the
situation in Cyprus between the
Turks and the Greeks.
Part of Bill Clinton's
work in the foreign policy
arena has to deal with econom
ics. With an interdependent
world and expanding free
trade, the President has focused
on expanding trade to South
America and Africa. The presi
dent suffered a defeat on fast
track to Chile but that does not
seem to have held him back as
he continues to fight to open
markets for American goods.

A major reason for the
president's recent emphasis in
peace and security around the
world is due to the fact that
Washington is not the best
place in the world for him.
With continuing sex scandals
and the ongoing media focus
on Monica Lewinsky, the Presi
dent is being undermined in the
nation's capital. Around the
world his leadership is easier to
establish. That's why the for
eign-policy tilt of the Clinton
Administration will probably
continue until his resignation,
oops I mean retirement.

by Christina Dickert
Columnist I had fun on Saturday
night. No, I didn't go out,
booze up, and not'remember
what I did the next morning. I
went to the Black Student
Union's Step Show. It was awe
some. I seriously did not ex
pect so many people to be
there, but I couldn't even see
over the crowd" in front of me.
I also didn't k_^now, What to ex
pect. I mean, I had see step
shows on television before, but
not in person. I wanted to see
the cool routines that these
young men and, women had
practiced hard for ( ., Stepping is
something that takes a lot of
hard work and dedication, not
to mention coordination.

Not to my surprise, Pro
fessor Gray from the African
American Studies _Department
stepped forward to say a few
words. A lot of faculty advi
sors do that at certain events.
What I didn't expect_,was what
came next. Professor Gray pro
ceeded to explain that there
were "concerns'* expressed
throughout the campus as to
what was part of, the content
of the step show, meaning
sexual moves. Some people
were concerned that what we

students would see over the
next hour and a half would
corrupt us in some way. I
thought that was ridiculous.
Then I looked around the room
and saw about four security
guards standing in ' the door
ways. That's more than there
were when Bob Dole came here
to speak. What made these
concerns rise all of a sudden?
Could itbe that these
people who were so worried
about our well-being were so
closed-minded that they
couldn't get past the fact that

it was a show performed by
African-Americans? Were these
people scared that in a : matter
of an hour we would walk out
of the Ballroom as the prover
bial "gang-bangers"? That is
ludicrous. '
If I'm right, Gettysburg is
working towards a more cultur
ally-diverse campus.. r ]_fw can
_thjsyiappen when _#eo_|_i|e dan't
take a step show at face value?
If these concerned citizens of
ouncamaus are _worried about
our exposure to explicit situa
tions, why don't they watch
MTV once in a while (which is
channel 51 on the college-sup
ported cable)? Maybe they
should check out Fiona Apple's
"Criminal" video. Thecollege
was all for Ms. Apple coming
here _^ while her video with her
prancing around in her under
wear was winning MTV Video
Music Awards. But when

people from the area would
like to come and gjvea step
show, all of a sudden, we stu
dents are being corrupted.
My assignment to ' the
"concerned" citizens of ' Gettys
burg College is to open their
mind ' s. I know that I enjoyed
the Step Show way more ' than
I would have enjoyed Fiona
Apple's concert (if " she had
shown). I am still the same
person, that I was Saturday be
fore I went to the step show. I
didn't start toting a gun because

I was "exposed" to an aspect
of AfricanAmerican life that I
had not formerly been _Ii) con
tact ( with. Actually_^ I adfriire
those men and women wHo
came to Gettysburg ' _^nd per
formed for us. They _Vvjere ex
cellent, ' and you can t ' efl that
they spent a lot of tirrie prac
ticing; for this. I look forward
to the next BSU sponsored step
show, and I look forward to
coming back to a more open
minded campus in the fall.

Enjoy
yourselves

the future. And that is where
the depression part comes in.
Please, take my word that
I am not anti-education and I'm
definitely not anti-money. I am
simply pro-fun. People, enjoy
yourselves! I can't think of a
bigger tragedy than to go home
after two semesters of hard
work and to spend the entire
summer going to work in an
office. Granted, it's inevitable
that most of us will eventually
end up in offices for at least one
summer prior to graduating.

by Rick Deutsch
Columnist Unless you're like me and
are postponing it for as long as
possible, most of you are prob
ably looking for internships for
this summer to bulk up your
resume. We've all been told
that next to grad school, an in
ternship in our possible termi
nal field of expertise is the most
important asset when applying
for jobs. That's probably true,
but isn't there anyone else out

there that is completely de
pressed by planning for the fu
ture? Think about our school
ing process: we go to grade
school to prepare for junior
high, then to junior high to pre
pare for high school, then on
to high school to prepare for
college, and finally to college
to prepare for our jobs. Maybe
you haven't noticed, but the
end goal there is our jobs! By
that process, our whole lives
are really just preparations for

But I don't think I could call
myself young anymore if when
asked how I was spending my
summer I started my reply with
"Working for..."
I can't wait to go home
for the summer, but my excite
ment certainly doesn't stem
from my job. It stems from
hanging out with my friends,
enjoying a nice dinner with my
girlfriend, spending Sundays
with my family, and getting a
warm "welcome-home" face
licking from Oliver.
Think of it this way: af¬

ter the summer entering your
senior year here, chances are
(unless you plan on being a
teacher or an outdoor ice skat
ing rink attendant) you will be
spending your summers work
ing. No more warm and sunny
three-month vacations. No
more weekly barbecues with
friends. No more unexpected
trips to the beach for a nice
four-day weekend. Real life is
just around the corner and I'm
not about to make the turn
until I absolutely have to. With
all this preparation for adult
hood we forget that we're still
kids. The number of people I
have tell me that they wish they
could get back to college is all
the convincing I need to assure
that I cherish this time. It's sad
but true, but this is our last
chance at true youth...and I
plan to make the most of it. I
hope you will too.

In the immortal words of
Ferris Bueller, "Life moves
pretty fast. If you don't stop

Conflict and Consensus

RA's are here to help not hurt their peers

Unfortunately, in The
Gettysburgian last week, an
anonymous and angered stu
dent unfairly lambasted the
Residence Life staff in the let
ter, "Rats on Campus?" As I
have had the opportunity to be
a member of the Residence Life
staff for two years, I find it ap
propriate as one of my last re
sponsibilities to uphold and
support the system that I fer
vently believe in.
The purpose of Residence
Life at Gettysburg College is to
"create a connection between
living and learning that is natu
ral, seamless, and
exciting...through the ideals of

respect, understanding, and
community" (Residence Life
Mission Statement).
Sounds simplistic does it
not? Yet the reality of the job
is that its complexity is great.
As the articulate, yet mis
guided, author of the anony
mous article stated, the college
"gives distinct and empowering
abilities to a select few and
leaves the vast majority impo
tent and 'differently abled"'.
There are two deeply
flawed, yet resolvable, prob
lems with this statement. One,
the assumption that RC/RA's
duties exceed our limited au
thority over our peers, and two

that an unequal distribution of
authority and responsibility
among peers is an incorrect
way to deal with violators of
Gettysburg College policies.
The assumption that, as
members of the Residence Life
staff, the only expectation
placed upon us is to enforce
rules established by the college
is not true. Our most time con
suming responsibilities are as
counselors, peer educators, and
social and academic resources.
This portion of our job is not
as public, nor as contested, as
that of policy enforcer. I fear
the assumption is therefore
made that these duties are not

fulfilled by RC/RA's.
However, if the curtains
were opened, our pessimistic
and temporarily narrow
minded peer would see the
daily one-on-one conversations
with residents, contacting ad
ministrators and support staff,
referrals, and necessary organi
zational duties. We are forced
to assume a position of peer
enforcer only after a peer has
made poor decisions and bro
ken policies clearly stated to
him\her in the Student Hand
book and Guidebook for Resi
dents. Therefore, if a student
has an issue with the way an

RC/RA enforces those rules
that he/she has broken, there is
a strong likelihood that the stu
dent should be upset with
themselves for breaking the
rules, not with the RC/RA for
enforcing them.
Furthermore, I firmly be
lieve that the mature way to
deal with one's anger over what
a student feels is an unfair situ
ation is to confront the RC/RA
directly. That would be an edu
cated response.
Secondly is the issue of
the peer to peer relationship

Eisenhower award
an honor to all

by Cammie Grant
Columnist The 1998 Eisenhower
Leadership Prize Dinner was
held Tuesday evening at the
Hilton Hotel in Washington
D.C. It was a very festive and
patriotic event. This year's re
cipient was William S. Cohen,
current U.S. Secretary of De
fense. Gettysburg College and
the Eisenhower World Affairs
Institute jointly give the
Eisenhower Leadership Prize.
The recipient must possess
qualities which reflect charac
teristics of Dwight D.

Eisenhower. President
Eisenhower was an honest,
charismatic individual who
took great pride in the United
States. Previous recipients of
the award are Lt. General Brent
Scowcroft, General Colin
Powell, Honorable Lloyd
Bentsen, Honorable Bob Dole,
President George Bush and
Nobel Laureate Elie Wiesel. In
addition to Cohen, these recipi
ents are all very deserving of
the award. They are amongst
the most prominent leaders of
our country. Awardees receive
$25,000 and a bronze replica
of President Eisenhower.
Cohen has an outstanding po¬

litical record. He served as a
Representative and Senator
from Maine and now serves as
the 20th Secretary of Defense,
under President Clinton. In
addition to his current position,
he also writes. He has either
authored or co-authored eight
books.
Prior to dinner, Cohen
addressed the audience. In his
speech, he spoke very highly of
Dwight D. Eisenhower. It was
interesting to listen to an ex
pert of defense comment on a
war hero. He also quoted au
thors and described the duties
of his current position. Cohen
also applauded Clinton for
crossing party lines in his cabi
net selections. He is a well
rounded individual who is per
sonable and intelligent. How
ever, he is very serious about
his job and takes great pride in
it.

After listening to Bob
Dole speak a few weeks ago
and Cohen Tuesday night, it is
easy to distinguish the charac
teristics that one must posses in
order to receive this great
honor. It is also an honor for
Gettysburg College to be in
volved with The Eisenhower
World Affairs Institute and the
wonderful leaders who are as
sociated with it.

Serious thoughts from random thinker

by Sara Sprenkle
Random Thinker
Something has been both
ering me for over a year. Now,
I have to attempt to write a ra
tional argument for something
that I am emotionally attached
to. Here goes everything.
I am impressed by the
number of letters about Dr.
Edward DeClair's tenure denial
that have been printed in The
Gettysburgian. What I haven't
seen are letters of support for
Dr. David Levine, who was also

denied tenure. This may have
been because Dr. Levine did
not wish to have any aggressive
reaction movement because the
person most hurt by these
things is the person that they
are meant to help. I respected
his wish—until now. This is the
last issue of The Gettysburgian
that will be printed while
Levine is still employed at Get
tysburg College, and I want
everyone to know that I think
that his tenure denial was one
of the worst decisions that the
College has ever made.

In The Gettysburgian's
Best of Gettysburg survey, 1
chose Dr. Levine as my favor
ite professor. (Features Editor
Barb Dickson can vouch for
me.) I have had Dr. Levine for
the majority of my computer
science courses, and I am glad
I did, since I won't have the
chance to take any classes from
him during my senior year.
Besides his extensive in
volvement within the depart
ment (programming team ad
visor, colloquium co-chair,
etc.), Dr. Levine is one of the

few professors who attends
events outside of his depart
ment. He is interested in many
other disciplines. An example
of this (from my understand
ing) is his work in the Spanish
Department with interactive
programs, which have been
turned over to different stu
dents since his initial work.
Partly because of his in
volvement, Dr. Levine is well
liked and supported by his col
leagues. In particular, I had a
conversation with a Political
Science professor who spoke
very highly of Levine when I
mentioned that I was disap
pointed that Levine was denied
tenure.
Dr. Levine is also one of
those professors that you can
find at work any day of the
week. He is always willing to
help a student or just chat with
you about baseball, current
events, or whatever else is on
your mind.

Having Dr. Levine as an
advisor isn't easy. You can
never say, "I want to get the
distribution requirements done
early" because you'll get your
self into a discussion about lib
eral arts colleges and what the
purpose of distribution require
ments is. If he senses that your
schedule is not difficult
enough, he will challenge you
to add another course or opt
for a harder course instead of
the one you're planning on tak
ing. Dr. Levine will do his best
to ensure that you get a good
education in your four years at
Gettysburg College.
Dr. Levine loves to teach.
He tells stories that seem unre¬

lated to the topic covered, but
he ties everything together, and
students understand concepts
better when they remember
things like "pizza values." But,
no one will ever claim that Dr.
Levine is an easy professor. Dr.
Levine has also helped me in
courses that he isn't teaching. I
knew that he'd be willing to
help me, and I would under
stand the material better if he
explained it to me.
Maybe I'm biased be
cause I have gotten to know Dr.
Levine well enough that I
would consider him a friend.
Sometimes, I got visibly upset
when we were interviewing
candidates to replace him, but
that's because I really regret
that Dr. Levine will not be here
next year at my graduation.
For this to be a legitimate
testament of Dr. Levine's supe
rior ability as a professor, I
must add some personal expe¬

.
I remember being in his
office during the Spring Semes
ter of my freshman year after a
Computer Science 103 test and
Dr. Levine's attempts to con
vince me to continue on to
Computer Science 104. I
should have told him that his
efforts were futile since my ad
visor had already signed my
form, and I was going to enroll
in CS104 in the fall. I guess it
doesn't matter really; the point
is that he took the time out to
tell me that he could see talent,
and I should continue on with
the discipline.
Sometime in either my
CS103 or CS104 course, Dr.
Levine told me that I had an

intuition for computer science.
I have often wondered how he
could tell that I had this "intu
ition," especially when I was
only in introductory courses. I
remember him telling me that
he had heard from other stu
dents that I was helping them
with their programs, and I
guess that's how he knew. (I
still kind of want to ask him,
but I always forget.) It's one
of those selfish things that I
want to know, and coming
from a person like him, a per
son that I respect and admire,
it's something that I'll want to

remember when I am disap
pointed with myself.
So, those things hap
pened two years ago. Dr.
Levine found out that he was
denied tenure in December of
1996. Nonetheless, he hasn't
forgotten his responsibilities as
a professor. Actually, what he
did was above and beyond the
call of duty. Last Monday, he
met with my group that partici
pated in the Mathematical
Contest in Modeling. We
didn't do as well as we would
have liked, and he met with us
to tell us how we could have

submitted a better entry. He
didn't disrespect us by empha
sizing the bad, but he was very
fair in his judgement. We came
away knowing that we had
done good work, but hadn't
presented it well. We know
where we can improve our pa
per when we compete in the
contest next year. Jokingly, Dr.
Levine ended our meeting with
"I hope you guys finish second,
behind the school I'm at next

That's enough reminisc
ing, but I think those are some
fine examples of a professor
who cares about his students,
even when he knows that these
are the students that he will be
rooting against next year. Why
should he help us? Gettysburg
College screwed him over. He
should say to hell with the stu
dents as well. I'm so grateful
he hasn't taken that attitude
because I would have missed a
lot of learning opportunities if
he had.
Finally, one of the worst
parts of this fiasco is that noth
ing has come out of these de
nials of two well-liked profes
sors—professors who really
teach and care about students.
The factionalized Political Sci
ence department would not
cease individual pettiness and

infighting to effect a change,
and Dr. Levine did not want
anything from his department.
I hope if (or when?) a
similar situation occurs, stu
dents in both affected depart
ments can rally together and
get some changes made. Did
anything ever come out of
those town meetings? I don't
think so. I think they were
thrown out at us to give us a
little gratification, but nothing
has changed. Worthy profes
sors will continue to be denied
tenure in favor of unworthy
professors.
In conclusion, Sara (along
with others who didn't know
what to say or how to say it)
says, "Good luck, Dr. Levine,
and teach your students to aca
demically shame Gettysburg
College."

Housing at Gettysburg is in need of serious change

To the Editor:

Disorganization +
injustice + chaos +
angry students = room
selections by the lottery
system I have to admit I was sur
prised on April 15,1998 which
happened to be a Wednesday
when my roommate for next
year and I were told with a
large number of other people
that the school was out of hous
ing. Yeah. Out of housing.
The people in charge at this
"housing meeting" assured us
that every student will get
housing because of drop outs,
expulsions, etc. However, the
rooms ran out before passing
the number 415 out of 600+.
I don't really comprehend how
there will be openings for al
most two- hundred students.

It is an interesting situa
tion because all of my friends
who also attend fine academic
institutions have their housing
set for the most part. Many of
them have apartment like com
plexes set up for the coming
year or at least their normal
housing is set and ready to go.

They were also very surprised
and amused that there were
restrictions for living off-cam
pus. But, they are all very
pleased with their situation.
And somehow myself and a
large group of other students
find ourselves in a ridiculous
limbo crap shoot. If by some
miracle the confused flock of
students including myself
should all be housed, I seriously
doubt we will all be in our
proper places. I know that my
roommate and I have no inten
tion of living in Lamp Post,
Carlisle or any of the other
"special house." But, because
of the overflow in people and
the disorganization within the
system we have been told that
this might happen. All we want
is a normal and decent living
environment and a place also
conducive to study and relax
ation. However, we should be
living in more than a decent liv
ing environment for $2,656 a

year.
Getting off-campus: an
unnecessary stubborn
fight

Before even having the
joy of attending the "housing
meeting" I had been in the pro
cess of trying to convince the
ever-powerful Residence Life
committee to give permission
to three of my friends and my
self to get an off- campus house
that was available. I have talked
to many upperclassmen about
this subject and the reply is al
ways something like "good luck
man...it's ###@@@ impos
sible." This off campus hous
ing opportunity was extraordi
nary in its location and price.
I'm not going to mention what
the price was compared to the
$2,656 that my parents and I
pay for a very small room here
and the privilege of sharing
bathrooms and showers with

twenty other people because it
could cause a riot, and I'm not
a violent person. Even after
talking to my parents, Resi
dence Life were still as stub
born as goats. My friends and
I that were interested in this
house are not involved in fra
ternities but do have a band
that needs space to play and
keep equipment. The music

department has not helped us
in the least bit in storing our
equipment or giving us a place
to play. My old high school
offered more support to music
than this very prestigious insti
tution. But all this will be ad
dressed in another article. My
point is: why should I not be
able to establish residence off
campus if I desire to? Is this
boarding school, or military
school in which I have to earn
the ranks in order to gain privi
leges. I am here for an educa
tion not to be told were to live.
I don't want to give off the
wrong idea here. When using
the housing of the school it
makes sense that they have a
say in where people live. The
point I am trying to get across
is that I am nineteen years old,
and two of my friends which I
was planning to room with in
this beautiful house will be

twenty by next semester. A
person can establish legal resi
dency in the U.S. at age eigh
teen years old. Why do I have
a problem establishing resi
dence off-campus at nineteen
years old at Gettysburg Col¬

lege? When asking to move
off-campus my friends and I are
not asking anything from the
College itself. We are just ask
ing to be on our own as we are
entitled to. Maybe the College
doesn't want to loose the
money and just wants our
families to pay the ridiculous
room rates. However, this does
not make sense taking into con
sideration that all the campus
living areas are filled right now.
I know that the reply to this
from some higher authority

will be "spaces will open."
Maybe they will and maybe
they will not. And... maybe
just maybe my roommate and
I will be placed into the desired
living area. But, still I feel vio
lated that I can not reserve the
right to live on my own con
sidering the only thing holding
me back is permission from the
school. I am not sure why I
need anyone else's permission
to do something as basic as liv
ing where I want considering I
am held as an adult by the law
and government.

Conflict and Consensus

Macs will be around for at least a couple more years

To the Editor:

The "Consider This" col
umn of April 23, 1998 dealt
with the debate over
Macintoshes vs. PCs on the
Gettysburg College Campus.
Some of the statements in the
article seem to be based on a
misunderstanding of the
College's current policy in this
area. This policy, like every
thing in the world of comput
ing, is examined and updated
frequently, and it is often hard
to promulgate the latest
changes.
A faculty committee com
prised of seven members from
various disciplines, called the
Information Resources Advi
sory Committee (IRAQ, exam
ined the Mac vs. PC issue dur
ing the past year in order to
provide recommendations to
Provost DeNicola.

These recommendations the April 2,1998 faculty meet

are the basis for our current ing
policy. IRAC's efforts focused
on three important topics:
1) What type of com-
puter should the college recom
mend to incoming students?
2) What type of com-
puter should the college recom-
mend for faculty and staff desk-
tops? 3) When a public lab such
as Glatfelter 112 (Macintosh)
becomes obsolete, what should
be the replacement or upgrade
strategy?
IRAC examined these
questions by considering costs,
long term impact on academ-
ics, curriculum support, faculty
freedom, industry trends and
technical support. Their com
plete list of recommendations
can be found in the minutes of

_ei
rol cor ;
anc to_;
res: Careful analysis of the is
sues led IRAC to endorse the
following:
1) Gettysburg College
will recommend Windows
compatible computers for all
new students. Currently en
rolled students with Macs will
continue to be fully supported
until they graduate. IRAC
could not identify any Mac spe
cific software that was manda
tory for students to run on their
computers and Information
Resources and Computing has
indicated it would realize a cost
and staff savings if it only had
to support one platform in the
residence halls.
The College owned Mac
labs will continue to be avail
able for students who need ac¬

cess to specialized Mac soft
ware. This year our incoming
first year class owned 10%
Macs vs 90% PCs, reflecting a
continuing trend towards PC's
that was felt in other schools
across the nation.
2) IRAC's second recom
mendation is that the Mac lab
in Glatfelter Hall will be con
figured with 16 new Macs
(most likely Apple G3's) plus a
seventeenth unit for the in
structor. This upgraded lab will
be configured to provide in
structors with a more conve
nient teaching arrangement
and with space for two students
to work at one computer. Since
the Mac Lab in Glatfelter cur
rently holds 22 computers, the
remaining computers will be
upgraded with PCs and will be
relocated to Musselman Li
brary. No changes are recom¬

mended for the other public
labs at this time.
3) IRAC's third recom
mendation is that Gettysburg
College will continue to sup
port both the Windows and
Mac operating systems. Faculty
and departments may continue
to use the platform they choose
as best suited for their work.
If both platforms are equally
suitable in satisfying user needs,
conversion to the Windows
operating system may result in
some saving for the College
and should be considered. The
College will provide conver
sion assistance to support and
assist the departments and fac
ulty converting from the Mac
to the Windows operating sys
tem.

Season on diamond rough, future looks smooth

by Ted Hartman
Staff Reporter The Bullets' baseball
squad is in its hnal week of play.
This spring saw Gettysburg get
off to an impressive 8-3 start
and then fall out of playoff con
tention, losing six of seven
games. Though tallying a dis
appointing 8-10 Cenntenial
Conference record, the Bullets
were able to salvage a winning
season at 18-17.
Recent successful indi
vidual and team performances
have given Gettysburg baseball
hope for next season. The Bul
lets blanked York 10-0 on Tues
day with a combination of
clutch hitting and errorless de
fense.

Defensive problems
plagued Gettysburg through
the middle of the year, extend
ing innings and tiring pitchers.
Freshman hurler Drew Chiesa
enjoyed the play in the field
Tuesday and went the distance,

allowing for
only five hits.
Chiesa and
Freshman Pat
Jordan are
two first year
hurlers that
should prove
to be an im
portant part
of the squad
next season.
I n
Saturday's 1

Washington College, Jor
dan worked
very effec
tively, having
to hurl just
sixty-five
pitches.
However, the
Bullets were

batter's hox

and the loss allowed Washing- ference. fielder Daryi- Clancy posted a

R B I s .
Woods
was named,
not only
player of
the week,
but also
to the
Confer
e n c e
Honor Roll. Se
nior left-

New addition to the Bul
lets' lineup, Kit Wannen, has
also contributed impressively.
First-year studend Wannen did
not play in the first half of the
spring, however, in a handful
of late season appearances, he
was able to take over the start
ing catching job. Brett Thorp
was also able to make a big
impact on the lineup as a fresh
man, and is now the everyday
short-stop.
The Bullets concluded
this season in fourth place in
the Cenntenial Conference,
falling behind champion Johns
Hopkins, Ursinus, and Wash
ington College. Only the first
two teams in the Conference
qualify for the Division III tour
nament, and therefore the Bul
lets' season will end with
tomorrow's non-league game
versus Lebanon Valley. Coach
Campo is very optimistic with
the crop of incoming freshmen
and the return of all current
players.

Bullets softball squad stays on target, has record breaking year

by Bill Davidson
Staff Reporter The Lady Bullets had _t
disappointing close to their fan
tastic season, losing their final
three games to finish with a 24
10 record. Sweeping Lebanon
Valley College to begin the
week, the women seemed
poised for a championship run.
However, a decisive loss tc
Messiah and a doubleheadei
drubbing inflicted by Western
Maryland left them short of a
conference championship.
At Lebanon Valley, Angie

Hoptak tossed a 3-hitter, strik
ing out one batter and walking
none as the Gettysburg women
notched a 3-1 victory.
Erin Killeen's two RBI
single in the top of the 7th
capped a 3-run rally to defeat
the Flying Dutchwomen. In
the nightcap, Karyn Miller had
four singles in as many at bats,
scoring two runs and driving in
one, as the Lady Bullets com
pleted the sweep. Sara
Graveline also supplied offen
sive punch, lacing a two RBI
double in the 5th. Suzanne
Dailey picked up the win with
seven strong innings.

After being 1-hit by Mes
siah, the women were swept by
Western Maryland, dropping
decisions of 10-1 and 5-0.
Despite this disappointing end,
several Bullets enjoyed record
setting seasons.
Defensively, Erin Killeen
surpassed her own single sea
son putout record, improving
from 218 a year ago to 237.
Jen White narrowly passed Tif
fany Wright's ('97) year-old
record for at-bats in a season,
finishing with 104 to Wright's

103. Karyn Miller batted .484
on the season, shattering the
previous mark of .468 set by
Jacquie Gatti in 1991. White
and Miller also broke Mary
Sautter's 11 year-old record of
38 hits in a season, with 46
apiece.
The future of Gettysburg
softball is promising. Their
entire pitching staff returns,
including strikeout leader (21),
Angie Hoptak and wins leader,
(7) Suzanne Dailey.
In addition to White and
Miller, the Bullets also return
defensive standout, Sara
Graveline; stolen base leader,
Jess Rising; and emerging star,

Casey Stevens.
"I think next year's team
will be in the running for the
conference title," said an opti
mistic Coach Kirkpatrick. "1
feel we have a very strong core
returning to maintain our win
ning tradition."
The Bullets, however,
will need to fill holes created
by the loss of the three senior
captains: Traci Bullock,
Marybeth Korejko, and Jill
Murphy. Coach Kirkpatrick
had flattering remarks for all of
them. "Jill is an outstanding stu
dent of the game. She was al
ways willing to sacrifice herself
for the good of the team."
"Traci has an outstanding
arm and was probably our most
:onsistent player."

"Marybeth was a very in
tegral part of our defense and
offense. At third she was steady
and occasionally outstanding."
"As a group, these young
women showed excellent lead
ership both on and off the field.
They thought of the team first
and themselves last. It has been
more than a pleasure to have
coached them and an honor to
have known them,"
Kirkpatrick commented.

Bullet hurler Mellissa Hazzard fires a seed towards home
Hazzard will be back next year as one of the primary Bullet
pitchers.

Bullets reign as champs begins again

by Henry Fawell
Assistant News Editor

riade a turn for the better on
Saturday, as they took hold of
the tempo early-on against
F&M and never let go.
"Marymount opened our eyes
a little bit a few days before,"
said senior Mike McCrain,
"then we realized we were a
game away from the champi
onship and we wanted to close
it out with a big win."
Scott Lowery, arguably
the most consistent player this
year for the Bullets, helped seal
the deal with an eight point
performance, on five goals and
three assists. Jamie Bateman

added another three goals,
while juniors Ross Garretson
and Lee Hemming each scored
twice for Gettysburg.
The Bullets offense reeled
off 42 shots in all, while the
defense held the Diplomats to
just 12. Andrew Barter col
lected six saves in the victory.
Gettysburg's final regular
season game comes this Satur
day when they travel to Ithaca
College in New York. Ithaca is
currently ranked No. 8 in Di
vision HI and will be looking
to upset the Bullets in order
gain home field advantage for
the NCAA Tornament.

The Gettysburg men's la
crosse squad captured the Cen
tennial Conference champion
ship on Saturday by pounding
Franklin & Marshall on their
home field by a score 16-5. The
victory marked the third time
in the conference's five year
existence that Gettysburg has
captured the crown, the past
two coming in 1994 and 1995.
The win on Saturday did
not come, however, before a
mid-week scare from unranked
Division I opponent
Marymount University, who
caught the Bullets off-guard
and nearly escaped with a stun
ning upset. Marymount was
able to muster a 6-3 halftime
lead, but could not hold the
advantage against a second half
Gettysburg comeback.

The Bullets scored four
unanswered goals in the third
quarter, but still found them
selves in a battle that would
wage up until the final minutes.
Senior Doug Sage nailed an un
assisted goal with 2:30 left in
the game to break the 8-8 tie
and put the game out of reach

opposition.

for good.
Junior Rob Crowe deliv
ered an outstanding perfor
mance in the afternoon, as he
won a perfect 10 of 10 face-

offs and put in the final goal of
the first half, which cut
Marymount's lead to three
goals. "They were a surprisingly

good team, " said senior Jamie
Bateman, "We only beat them
6-4 last year and we were lucky
to get a win from them this
year." Gettysburg fortunes

Track teams ready to shine

If past form holds true, as
many as four or five schools
could be in the hunt for the
women's team title when the
Centennial Conference con
ducts its annual outdoor track
and field championship this
weekend at Haverford College.
On the men's side, how
ever, the other eight schools
will, in all likelihood, be chas
ing Haverford, which has
emerged as the team champion
four years in a row.
Gettysburg women, who
are the defending champions
and have never placed lower
than third in the team stand
ings, figure to be a contender
for fhe conference title. Cathy
Spangler is the defending con
ference chamipon in the
women's discus, she won that
svent last year as a freshman

with a toss of 116' 11 . Sopho
more Beth Castagno, who
holds Gettysburg's high jump
record at 5'6", has the poten
tial to take the conference title
and jump 5'7" this weekend.
Other track and field ath
letes who are expected to place
high and do well this weekend
are Tabitha Gary (high, long,
and triple jumps), Jackie Klug
(100m Hurdles, long jump),
Andi Therit (100m, 200m),
Anne Schenck (100m, long and
high jump), and Karen Helmick
(1500m, 3000m).
Last year, the men fin
ished fourth, behind
Haverford, Swarthmore and
Western Maryland. The men
also have hopes of running
avvay with the title. Senior
Nathan Grim, who will be trav
eling to the NCAA tournament
for the shot-put on May 20-23,
placed first in the shot and dis
cus at last year's outdoor con¬

ference meet.
This weekend, Grim
hopes to improve upon last
year's performance, where he
broke both meet and confer
ence records. Grim's best ef
fort this season in the shot is
52' 11". Senior Bryan Sentz
will also figure prominently in
the conference meet, compet
ing in the pole-vault, long
jump, 100m, 200m and the
1600m relay.
Junior Brendon Clark,
who has a season best of
1:59.16 in the 800m, will be
running for the championship
in both the 800m and 1500m
runs. Leading the distance
squad, along with Clark, will
be first-year student Jonathon
Catlett in the 1500m and
3000m steeple chase.

Despite the predictions
for nasty weather this weekend,
these Bullets are expected to
shine.

Senior track and field captain Nathan Grim grunts and
prepares to throw at the top of the conference.

This special athlete will GRAB your attention

Whether she is scoring goals or helping people reach theirs, Kristin Sullivan has been an
integral part of many lives at Getysburg for the past four years...

by Steve Jenkins
Sports Editor
Somebody hand me a dic
tionary. All right, somewhere
in here there have to be a few
words that I can use to describe
the person that Kristin Sullivan
has become. Hmmm, nope,
there are no words that can pin
point this amazing woman ex
actly, but man, we can try. With
nothing but toughness, a tire
less work ethic, and a desire to
help others, "Sully" as her
friends call her has left a per
manent imprint on the students
of Gettysburg College.
As you may or may not
already know, Sullivan is a
dominant force on the lacrosse
field. She dumfounds defend
ers, flying effortlessly past them
with her tremendous speed,
then changes her stick to her
non-dominant left hand
"schooling" anyone who gets in
her way. And to think it all
started just four years ago.

What? There is no way
that Sully just started playing
lacrosse her freshman year. It
is impossible to go from never
having picked up a stick to Di
vision III All-America in only
four years! Well, impossible is
not a word that is in Kristin's
vocabulary. "Nothing is im
possible," she says, "if you
work hard, and push yourself
to the edge, you can reach all
of your goals." It is this men
tality that has made Sullivan
such a successful leader, men
tor, and role model, but she has
also had some good teachers.
The one person that has
been the most important in
Sullivan's life is her father. "He

is always there for me, even a
when there looked like there _^
was no hope, or when I was
really down. He always had
a card for me. He always
has a way of renewing my _Jm
faith in my team and _^jSfl
the job I have to get _^HP
done. I could J§3_gF
never replace jmB/_F
Kristin's fa-_^S2_t_^
ther instilled in
her the will never to
quit, never to let the difficulty

of a task scare you, no matter
what the odds. That is why she
has become so successful, that
is why she is such a dynamic
character.
"My brother and I used
to battle," Kristin, reminisces.
"We used to watch the Price is
Right, and in between commer
cial breaks... man we used to
go at it. I never yelled to see
Bob Barker and the Showcase
Showdown more in my life."
So, being one of the younger
kids in her family Kristin took

many a beating, but as we see
today on the lacrosse field Sully
is no stranger to dishing out
some pain on the opposing de
fense as well.
If you have ever seen
Sully play lacrosse, there would
be no doubt in your mind that
she is a leader. "I think that a
leader has 'moves' on and off
the field. I am one of the only
older players that the young
freshman and sophomores have
to look up to. I try to do my
best on and off the field to be

fair, establish
initiative,
and show
them no
matter
what ¦ » '
that '«"
there is
always
hope."
With
Sim ' _^

f and myself, and pushing people
to their full potential. We all
want everyone involved to be
the best they can be and find
_«_a _^ _j out the most about them
SgjaE|i ^_ se lves as they can. Through
all of our activities that is

rha d her
work cut out
for her. But like
any of these young
players will tell you,
Kristin Sullivan has ,
been a model of in- _(
tegrity, guts, and j
that scrappy atti¬

tude that have people in awe what we hope to promote... re
of her character. spect, truth, self-confidence,
The proudest moment and pushing yourself until you

that Sully can remember was
this year during a Centennial
Conference clash with Ursinus.
"I just remember thinking after
we won that I was so satisfied.
I was so proud of the younger
players. Nobody expected us
to beat them. We were so
'young'. But we sucked it up,
tackled the challenge, and said
'hey if you play with us we are
gonna kick your butt.' It just
made all the hard work worth
while, you know? It was a tre
mendous feeling for me and the
team."
Sullivan's work ethic has
not always been the intense lo¬

comotive train that it is now. In
fact, in the fall of her junior year
she had a big turn-around when
she did a transfer semester at
Duke University. "I went down
to Duke and everyone was so
intense and passionate about ev
erything. I just picked up on
what they were doing, and de
cided that I was going to reach
my full potential everyday. I
worked out seven days a week,
I just kept going." Working to
her full potential is a idea that
Kristin personifies and it has a
truly amazing effect on every
person she meets.

This spark lit a fire in
Sullivan to really do everything
in her life with all the intensity
of a bolt of lightning, and that
was when she found GRAB
That is right, you know GRAB,
the Gettysburg Recreational
Adventure Board, oh yeah, well
that is Kristin Sullivan. "Yeah,
one day my friend Brad
McCutcheon asked me if I
wanted to be a part of starting
this program, and I filled out
the application. I guess you
could call all of the members
that year the pioneers of
? GRAB, the rest is history."
C "GRAB is such an un
m portant thing in my life," says
* Sullivan, "It has taught me so
much about respect for others

have nothing left."
Sully could not possibly
name all the important people
who played such a tremendous
role in the _ >_u*^ . ..
matura

rvi if h ?* i-i
tion of
GRAB,
but she
said that
she
was /
s o

_^^F her thoughts
_^H and feelings in
_^B t he organiza
H tion. "GRAB
W _tft helped me to
P&f\ discover All

_^_gHti/_Rr self. the m
people that I came in
contact with were on the same
page as me. We all shared the
same mentality; the same pas
sion for living life to the full
est. I am so thankful that I was
a part of something this great.
It [GRAB] was our baby, and I
know we have people here now
that are going to help it grow."
Kristin Sullivan is going
to take all of the things that she
has learned on the field, as well
as on the rock wall, with her
into the future. What is she
going to do, you ask? Well, as
of now, she has plans to go into
the Peace Corps in South
America. She has not received
her orders yet, but regardless
of where she will be, she will
help the people there in more

ways than they know. We can
only hope the Peace Corps
knows what a special person
that they are getting, and what
kind of persona this strong
woman brings to the table.
I asked Kristin if she had
any regrets about her four years
here at Gettysburg. She looked
at the ceiling in the Bullet Hole,
searching. Then, with a tear in
her eye, she said to me, "I just
want more time. I'm not ready
to leave yet. I want to see
GRAB go. I just want
. ;O * to play lacrosse forever.
_$_P I just have such a strong
feeling for so many
things here. I don't want to
leave my friends, but that is the
way it goes, I guess."
Well, for this Environ
mental Science major/Biology

minor, who takes her bike ev
k erywhere, time is something
_^ that she will never hav e to
_^K worry about. She has left
_^K a legacy here at Gettys
W_* burg that everyone who
has been a part of her life
will always remember. Sully
can barely begin to understand
how much she has meant to so
many people here at Gettys
¦ t burg and for that we are for
i ever indebted to her.
I Kristin Sullivan has
* just about two weeks left
Bk"\ at this school before she
El receives her diploma.
Sp Which is good news for
Wjf all of you. That means
B you have two weeks left
to get to know this dy
namic, persevering, passionate
woman who has an intensity
for life like nobody has ever

seen. So, hustle over to the
GRAB house, where Kristin
lives, and set up an appoint
ment to sit down and talk to
this intense, awesome woman.
Oh yeah, as you talk to her, leaf
through your favorite pages of
the dictionary and try to find
some words to describe her.
You won't find any, but you can
try. You can look all over the
world for another a person like
Kristin Sullivan; you won't find
one... but you can try.
