College sued for
discrimination

pholo by Mark Astrom

by Rebecca Babbitt
Gettysburg College is
being sued by a former profes
sor who was denied tenure.
Kelfala Kallon has filed
a federal discrimination law
suit against the College. The
case is being heard by Judge
Rambo this week at the Fed
eral Court in Harrisburg. An
all white jury will decide the
outcome of the case.
Originally from Sierra
Leon in west Africa, Kallon
was a tenure-track professor
of economics at Gettysburg
from 1987 until the fall semes
ter of 1992 when he was de
nied tenure.
Kallon believes he was
denied tenure because he is
black.

The defence, led by the
college's attorney, Dana
Schadudo, is making a case
that Kallon was denied tenure
because of poor reactions from
students on their end-of-se
mester evaluations—not be
cause of his race.
A number of memos,
emails, and letters has been in
troduced as evidence by the
prosecution. Most of the cur
rent faculty of the economics
department have been called to
testify, including Derrick
Gondwe, Robert Gemmiill,
and Anne Fender.
Fender, Chair of the
Economics department, testi
fied Monday that Kallon
would be a "good addition to
the department and the
school."
In a memo sent by then
Provost, Baird Tipson, he de¬

scribed Kallon s teaching meth
ods as causing "anxiety, insecu
rity and even antagonism" in his
students. Tipson based his re
marks on comments by students
given in their evaluations.
Other memos and letters
stated that Kallon "needs to
soften his image," and the some
students dislike his style."
Despite the reviews made
by students, Kallon was unani
mously recommended for ten
ure by the Economics depart
ment faculty. His tenure fol
lowed the usual path and was
reviewed by the Faculty and
Personnel Committee (FPC).
The FPC also approved Kallon
for tenure. The final stepin ten
ure approval comes from the
President, and Haaland denied
Kallon's tenure.

Charles "Buzz" Myers
was called to the stand Tuesday.
Myers was also up for tenure
review in 1991. Myers filed a
grievance after his tenure was
denied. Shortly after he was
denied a permanent place on the
Religion department faculty,
the publishers of a scholarly
journal, Novmn Testimentum,
agreed to publish one of his ar
ticles. After conferring with
President Gordon Haaland,
Myers withdrew his grievance
and his tenure case was re
viewed by Haaland. Myers was
finally granted tenure in 1992.
Haaland will most likely
testify before the trial is fin
ished. The defense plans to rest
its case on Friday.

99 students killed by Bacchus

byDanLarkin
News Editor ,
This past week, the Gettys
burg College chapter of Bacchus
joined many other organizations
nationwide in observing Alcohol
Awareness Week.
The week's events provided
opportunities for students to hear
presentations, reflect with each
other on the impact of alcohol on
their lives, and promote a commit
ment to responsible drinking.
Bacchus is not a
prohibistionist organization, but
stresses contrloled, responsible
consumption of alcohol.
Perhaps the most visible
sign of Alcohol Awareness week

on the Gettysburg Campus came yes
terday, when Bacchus "killed"
ninety-nine students for "White Face
Day." The White Face Day program
was coordinated by sophomore
Kristen Fisher.
Between 8 am and 6 pm,
about ten students every ten minutes
donned white face paint and black
clothing. These studetnts refrained
from talking to others on campus and
wore signs explaining their "deaths.".
Programs like White Face Day
are put on by SADD and Bacchus
groups across the country to spread
a message about responsible usie of
alcohol.
This was done to symbolize
the death of a person every seven
minutes in alcohol related accidents.

According to Bacchus Pro
gramming Chair Matt Bange, "the
purpose of the white face was to
show what it would be like if these
people really were dead, and not
present on campus."
The "dead" students were
"resurrected" following a candle
light vigil that started in the College
Union Building and continued out
side to Plank Gym.
Aspeach was given on alco
hol awareness, and the "dead" stu
dents returned to the world of the liv
ing. Bange said that the recent al
cohol-related death of a Massachu
setts Institute of Technology student
has increased awareness and dem
onstrated a need for increased aware
ness.

Bange stated that he felt "al
cohol awareness has increased in
the student population [at Gettys
burg]." He said "If any good has
happened, it is because the students
are becoming more aware."
In conjunction with Alcohol
Awareness Week, Jean Kilborne an
internationally recognized spokes
person on the effects of alcohol and
tobacco advertising and a former
advisor to the US Surgeon General,
will speak at the Common Hour
today. Kilbourne's presentation,
titled "Deadly Persuasion," will be
held at 11:30 am in the College
Union Ballroom.

Sigma Nu battles College

Fraternity, College at odds over

computer _networking
by Henry Fawell r
Staff Writer rc
In recent weeks, the Sigma c
Nu fraternity has challenged the a
legitimacy of Gettysburg *
College's plan for computer net- c
working within all fraternity a
houses.
While the plan covers sev- _^ ga

eral other aspects of house main
tenance, the glaring point, ac
cording to the fraternity, has been
the price of the plan and the net
working system. The brother
hood and House Corporation, a
company from which the frater
nity rents their house, have both
deemed the price totally unfit.
The plan provides all fra
ternities with regular house main
tenance, cleaning and, among
other things, access and mainte
nance to the computer network
ing system. The fee is five thou
sand dollars and is the same for
each fraternity. Sigma Nu is the
only fraternity on campus that has
not signed on with the plan.
Therefore, as Dean Murphy put
it, "Sigma Nu is now the only
non-member of the school".

Corey Ehrenworth, Vice

that in accordance with the plan,
"we would be giving a whole lot

than we could possibly hope to

House Corporation has
shown it's support for the stance
by refusing to sign on with the
college's plan until proper modi
fications are made to it.
Since Sigma Nu's refusal
of the plan, Gettysburg College
has taken a new course of action.
The college now intends to elimi-

nate from the house the dial-in tone
used by the brothers to check e
mail. Furthermore, it has also _pul
off a plan to install a cyber-optic
cable within the house, which was
apparently only a week or so away
from completion. The college will
continue the installation only when
deal has been signed.
According to the
Ehrenworth, the school is exercis
ing these methods as blackmail
against the fraternity and, in par
ticular, House Corporation.
The conflict has caused so

much discontent among members
of both parties, that a number of
people refused to comment on the
situation.
Thus far, the College has of
fered Sigma Nu one alternative to
its plan. The school has proposed
to place the fraternity on an ac
count with Lan.com company for
a fee of $ 15 per month, per mem
ber of the house. However, the
brotherhood has stated that this
plan rivals the illegitimacy of the
one prior to it. Dean Murphy knew
nothing of the proposed plan with

Lan.com.
l_^aii.cuin.
As of this past Sunday,
Sigma Nu had not been in contact
with the National Office, but was
planning to be shortly. The frater
nity has, however, offered the
school a plan believed to be more
reasonable.
This plan was recently sent
to the administration for voting,
but that has not yet taken place.
Dean Murphy hopes the situation
is resolved quickly, but as he stated
Monday, "we certainly think that
the [college's] plan is worth five
thousand dollars".

College offers young alumni chance to participate

from staff reports
The Gettysburg Department
of Annual Giving has created a va
riety of programs to encourage the
participation of Gettysburg's
younger alumni in College events.
At Gettysburg, young
alumni, members of classes gradu
ating within the past decade have
traditionally had the weakest
showing in support of the
College's Annual Fund.
-Two major programs that
the College has created to help in
crease the percentage of younger
alumni in College events after
graduation are the Cupola Society
Associates Program and the Com
mittee for Young Alumni.
The Cupola Society Associ
ates Program was created in 1996
by the Gettysburg College Board
of Trustees "to recognize and pro
mote leadership giving by the
College's most recent graduates."
Previously," membership in
the College's Cupola Society was
offered only to alumni who gave

$1,250 or more to the Annual
Fund each year.
The Associates program
grants Cupola Society Member
ship to graduates of the last ten
year who contribute $ 100 for each
year since their graduation.
According to Cathy Norris
('90), head of the Committee for
Young Alumni, the Cupola Asso
ciates Program "offers recent
graduates the benefit of network
ing with elite members of the
Gettysburg alumni."
Last year's introduction of
the Associates program, brought
more than 50 new members to the
Cupola Society, and 17 percent
increase in Annual Fund support
from that target group.

Dream a little dream...

by Melodie Foster
St aff Writer
We all have them, we all
want them, but what do we do with
them? Yes, I'm talking about
dreams, those sometimes pleasant,
sometimes demented, images that
haunt your mind while you sleep.
Studies have shown that every per
son has approximately four
dreams each night, though most
are not remembered in the morn
ing. Why do humans dream?
There are several scientific an
swers to that question which have
developed over the last hundred

years or so, but dreams have been
around much longer than that.
In the very first book of the
Bible, dreams are interpreted as
warnings and hidden messages
from God. In Genesis 40, Joseph
has a dream which tells him to flee
to Egypt, where he is imprisoned.
It is his ability lo interpret dreams
that frees him from prison, and he
discloses the meaning of the
Pharaoh's dream about seven fat
and seven thin cows to be a fore
shadowing of the impending seven
years of feast followed by seven
years of famine, a prophesy which
comes true.

It is also told in Mark 2:13
that Joseph had a dream which
told him to take Mary and the baby
Jesus and (lee to Egypt. It was
through his heeding of the dream,
interpreted as a message from
God, that Jesus survived his child
hood. Charlotte Bronte's famous
book Jane Eyre contains two
scenes in which Jane dreams of an
infant, once a week before she re
ceives news that the aunt who
raised her is dying, and once be
fore she discovers she cannot
marry her true love. The appear
ance of a child in a dream was a
symbol commonly accepted at the
time as a warning against impend
ing doom for oneself or one's kin.
Abraham Lincoln and his
wife, Mary Todd, both experi
enced dreams which foretold his
assassination months ahead of
time. Lincoln, during the open¬

ing weeks of his second term,
dreamt of awakening in the
night and seeing his face in the
mirror reflected once normally
and a second time disfigured, as
though in death. His wife cor
rectly took this as a sign that he
would not finish his second

term. Lincoln also once had a
dream while he was in the
White House. He
wandered ^^ _rf
around the build- _* _^ M
ing, and discov- m
ered it was in\ 3
mourning. He /
entered a certain /
room and saw a / _^^^
casket there. B_^ ^^^
Lincoln then
asked a mourner
standing near him who
had died. The mourner looked
at him and said. "The Presi-

Though the dream
as a warning was, and
still is a popular ex
planation for the im
ages one experiences j_>_a_
during sleep, science has _a|A
come up with a different_^_Mj
answer. In the early half oi_^_B
the twentieth century
Sigmund Freud developed a
philosophy which showed
dream as the manifestations of
the mind.
In sleep, when not held in
check by consciousness, the
mind could wander down roads
it passed during the day, but had
not been permitted to travel.
Thus, he said, the various situ
ations and people in one's
dreams could be traced back to
conversations had, places vis
ited, people discussed in pass
ing during the day.

Freud was also well
known for his theories on
sexual symbolism in dreams
and dreams as outlets for sub
conscious desires.
Modern science has pre
sented the world with an even
more concrete reason .why
people dream. When a person

is sleeping, many of the func
tions performed by their body
and brain are put on a suspended
mode. It has been found that cer
tain neurons in the brain, when
left unused for longperiods of
time, cease to function at all, and
dreams may simply be a sort of
screen saver that allows them to
be suspended 1 but still perform

some sort of function.
Another theory says that
the brain is constantly cycling
through images; in the daytime,
these are found in the form of
thoughts, and we tend to have a
bit of control over them. At
night, however, they are strung
together in the sometimes in
comprehensible form of dreams
due to the fact that we are not
awake to control their direction.
Some think that people are
constantly dreaming. This
would be possible because the
process of dreaming is function
ing in our subconscious mind,
and out of view. They may not
be defined as dreams technically,
but the activity is closely related.
However, during certain
cycles of sleep, we can view
these dreams with our con¬

science mind and record them in our tory, which leads one to question
memory (which is why we sometimes their credibility. , _,
we remember them). , According to one source, the
Confused? Try to imagine this: steps to analyzing your dreams are:

your brain, mind, and spirit, while at
rest, "review" and analyze in their
own way your long-term, short-term,
and spirit memory.
It has in its background the
trends of your life and philosophy ,to
influence, it. Your mind is also pro
cessing spiritual data, your be
liefs, whether or not you have
^^V violated them, your infor
\ mation gained through

psychic intuition
(which we all al
legedly have, to
_^^ a certain de
H| gree), and, of
_^B course, any
_^1 communica
W tion from God.
_^ All of this
data, as well as
your subcon
scious "reading
between the lines"
of what people do
and tell you, is then
processed unsuper
vised by you. All this
data is a form of
chaos, and your mind
puts it all together in a

_*_vr form ol visual screen¬
play: a medley of sight, sound, emo
tion, and imagined interactivity. This
is a dream.
Dreams are easily influenced
by factors in your life and spirit, and
these influences create categories that
are almost infinite. We broadly cat
egorize them in terms like "prophetic,
standard, physical, and nightmare" (to
name a few). And these we study each
on their own, in order to gain benefit
from them.
What do dreams mean? Well,
it all depends on what you believe.
Many people, in spite of the scientific
solution, are convinced that their
dreams are messages from their sub
conscious or from a higher power.
Thousands of books have been
written on the subject, including dic
tionaries of objects found in dreams
and their meanings These .sources
are fun to use, but can be contradic-

1. Identify the main concept
or theme of the dream.
2. Match the concept or
theme to a specific area of your life.
3. Get one _jof those
dictionaires (or one on.the Internet)
and figure out what _everything ba
sically means.
4. Take note of the first thing
that catches your attention.
5. List what everything
means to you.
Even so, dream interpreta
tion has long been a means to'un
derstanding oneself and one's life,
but it requires the memory of a

dream. This can be difficult, as
dreams fade away if they are not
immediately thought about upon
awakening. Many people keep
dream diaries, and find them help
ful not only for dream interpreta
tion, but also interesting in general.
Sophomore Laura Fairbairn
had to keep a journal for two weeks
for a Psychology class, and says,
"it was really interesting. Even
though I thought I didn't dream
very much due to sleep deprivation,
when I would write things down
first thing in the morning, I found
that I did in fact dieam."

Dreams have fascinated
people throughout time, leading to
some beautiful thoughts from some
of the greatest people in history.
"The soul in sleep gives
proof of its divine nature," said
Cicero.
"Why does the eye see a
thing more clearly in dreams than
the imagination when awake?"
asked Leonardo da Vinci.
There are no concrete an
swers to what dreams mean, or
even to the question of why people
dream. The fact that even in this
modern age where science is so
prevalent, many people still follow
such time-honored, firmly estab
lished practices shows that even
with the impact of technology on
our society, histoiical and lcligious
tradition remain strong.

Alpha Lambda Delta welcomes 50 new members

by Josh Eyler
Alpha Lambda Delta Editor
On Saturday, October 4 at
4 p.m., Alpha Lambda Delta, the
national society honoring a
student's academic achievement
in the first year of college, held
its initiation ceremony for new
members in the Luella
Musselman Paul Recital Hall of
Schmucker Memorial Hall.
To qualify for Alpha
Lambda Delta, these students
achieved a GPA of 3.5 or above
on a 4.0 scale. The new initiates
are now part of an organization
that has 217 chapters nationwide,
and in which more than 500,000
students have been initiated.
Alpha Lambda Delta was
founded in 1924 as an honorary
for freshmen women at the Uni¬

versity of Illinois.
The goal of the honor soci
ety are to promote academic ex
cellence and meaningful realiza
tion of the goals of the young men
and women of today.
The three advisors for
Gettysburg's chapter of Alpha
Lambda Delta, Dr. Robert C.
Nordvall, Dean of First Year Stu
dents, Amanda Rupert Strong, Pro
fessor of Religion, and Dr. Carey
Moore, ran the initiation cer
emony, along with outgoing Presi
dent Carrie R. Williams.
The honor society puts on
two events per semester. In the
fall, professors can honor fresh
men who are doing outstanding
work. These students get to have
dessert on the faculty side of the
Dining Hall and are served by

members of the society.
The fall is also when the
new members are inducted.
In the spring, the executive
board serves a dinner for freshmen
was have a GPA of 3.5 or above.
Last year's group did some
thing above and beyond this. They
had a program called "Caught
Studying." Members of the soci
ety would walk through the fresh
men dorms looking for open
doors. If the people in the rooms
were studying, the society would
give them candy.
Fifty members of the class
of 2000 became members of the
honor society.
The 1997 initiates of Alpha
Lambda Delta are Mary-Margaret
A. Ammerman, Ann Marie Bielli,
Sabrina L. Bosse, Christopher T.

Return to a different Oz

by Glen Beck
Staff Writer Somewhere over the rain
bow there is a sequel to the Wiz
ard ofOz. Actually, it's not over
the rainbow, but at any local video
rental store.
Now I know that that's a
cheesy opener for a review, but I
feel that it is very appropriate for
director Walter Murch's 1985 fol
low-up to the Wizard of Oz, en
titled Return to Oz.
The film starts with Dor
othy back at home in Kansas, not
being able to stop thinking about
Oz. On the farm, she finds a key
which she believes to have been
sent to her by her friends over the
rainbow. Auntie Em, worried for
Dorothy's mental health, takes her
to a doctor famous for working
with electric shock treatment.

In Case You Missed It

Afraid of the therapy, Dor
othy runs away, and she and
Ballina (a farm chicken) mysteri¬

ously find themselves in Oz. There
Dorothy finds the Yellow Brick
Road in pieces and a vacant Em
erald City in ruins. She discovers
that everyone has been trans
formed to stone by the Nome King
and the evil witch, Mombie.
It's now up to Dorothy,
Ballina, and their new friends Tik
Tok, Jack Pumpkinhead, and
Gump to defeat Mombie and the
Nome King, find the missing
Scarecrow, and get Oz back to nor
mal. This journey includes once
again being locked in a room in a
castle and having to choose friends
from a group of decorated boxes.
The film has better special
effects that the original film, but
remember that a lot has changed
in 46 years. In fact, Return to Oz
received an Academy Award nomi
nation for Best Effects (Visual).

As I watched, I just couldn't
get used to the different depictions

of the characters. Fairuza Balk (of
Craft fame) plays Dorothy. Judy
Garland was much older when she
portrayed the lead, so seeing a
younger girl playing the role just
bothered me.
The Scarecrow, the Tinman,
and the Lion are very exaggerated.
Where are Ray Bolger and Bert
Lahr when you want them?
And you're certainly not in
Kansas when you watch this film.
The director incorporates many
more expressionistic elements-

some that even make the film ter
rifying for younger kids (whom
the original film was meant for).
The new characters are all
very entertaining. My favorite is
the naive Jack Pumpkinhead. Ev
ery couple of minutes you'll find
yourself laughing at the this talk
ing pile of sticks with a big jack
o-lantern as a head.
The others, Tik-Tok (a ro
botic man) and Gump (a sofa with
a moosehead on the end), are also
quite amusing.

The screenplay is based on
the next of the books in the Oz se
ries (which is twelve books long)
by L. Frank Baum. These books
focus on Dorothy's many adven
tures in Oz, which are not just a
dream, as the Wizard of Oz im
plies. If you haven't already seen
this sequel, you should rent it. If
you have already, well, let's just
say that I don't think this is a
movie you can watch over and
over.

Side by side

by Cara Masucci
Contributing Writer
We all learned the lesson
when we were young: you have
to share. This is a concept that two
of the new English professors, Fred
Leebron and Kathleen Rhett, have
taken to heart. This husband-and
wife team share almost everything,
from their job to their car. It seems
the only thing they do not share is
their dresser!
This past spring the English
Department was looking to expand
its writing program. A position
opened up that called for one pro
fessor to teach both the fiction and
non-fiction writing courses. To
gether, Professor Leebron and Pro
fessor Rhett applied for the same
position.
Their idea was to split up the
position between themselves in re
gards to their disciplines. Leebron,
the fiction lover, would teach the
fiction courses while Rhett, an avid
non-fiction fan, would handle the
courses in that domain. But this is

not the first time the two profes
sors have decided to work together.
It's an almost story-like
meeting. Twelve years ago on the
first day of orientation at John's
Hopkins Graduate School, Rhett
and Leebron met. They have been
together ever since.
Rhett had already done her
undergraduate work at John's
Hopkins, and decided that after
working with two very well-known
writers, Stanley Fish and David St.
John, that she wanted to continue
her education there. Speaking
about St. John, she said that he was
"a teacher [who] made the differ
ence." Writing and teaching were
things that she had always known
she had wanted to do.

Two English professors mix personal and professional

Leebron,
on the other
hand, was con
vinced he would
have to go to
law school. Af
ter studying in
the Woodrow
Wilson School
at Princeton, he
decided to pur
sue a creative
writing career at
John's Hopkins.
Creative

writing had al
ways been
Leebron's "first
passion," but he
had always
thought it would
be something he
would do on the
side of law, or
medicine.
When the op
portunity came
along to go to
John's Hopkins,
he took it.

After re
ceiving their
Masters at
John's Hopkins,

ships there, as Professors Leebron and Rhett relax at home after a busy day
well as at many of teaching.

other places around the world.
These have allowed them to
travel to places like Thailand,
France, Mexico, Guatemala, not
to mention a half-dozen cities
within the United States. This
has been a great experience for
them, and has allowed them to
become quickly acclimated to

Gettysburg.
When asked what they
thought about Gettysburg, the two
professors were very enthusiastic.
Having each grown up in eastern
Pennsylvania, they like the prox
imity to their relatives, particularly
since they have two small children.
They insist that all their free time

goes to Kate
and Jacob.
They have gone
to the Apple
Festival and
toured the
battlefields with
their two chil
dren. They
both insist that
the Gettysburg
community is
"friendly, cre
ative, and ener
getic." In fact,
one of the major
reasons they de
cided to apply
here was their
respect for The
Gettysburg Re
view. Leebron
continued,
"There is a
good feeling of
dynamism in
Gettysburg."

The stu
dents interest
them, and the
faculty at the
college has
been great. The
only things they
would change
are the lack of
Thai food and

the lack of squash courts in the
area, two of their passions. Other
than that, they are entirely thrilled
with Gettysburg.
The conversation quickly
turned to their courses, and what
their positions entail. When asked
what it is like to share the same
position, they both laughed. "We

disagree," they both blurted.
However, it is a nice balance and
they make each other a better
writer and teacher. It is also a
good idea for them to teach under
different disciplines.
This semester Leebron is
teaching Introduction to Fiction
Writing and English Composition.
Rhett is handling the non_^fiction
domain with Forms of Creative
Non-Fiction. Next semester Rhett
will be teaching two non-fiction
courses while Leebron will teach
one fiction.
This led to the discussion of
what each of them has done in
their discipline so far. Leebron has
edited Post-Modern American
Fiction: ANorton Anthology, and
has written Creative Fiction: A
Writer's Companion, as well as
Out West.
Rhett has written Survival
Stories (Memory of a Crisis), and
Near Breathing (A Memoir of a
Difficult Birth).

In the upcoming months,
they hope to complete a couple
projects they are working on, as
well as spending more time with
their children. One of them is al
ways with the children; Kate, the
older of the two, has just become
obsessed with Grease.
Other than that, they share
responsibilities around the house,
the same car, but not the same
dresser. They have to set limits
somewhere.
The English Department set
out to find someone with energy
to develop the writing program at
the college. What it ended up with
it two unique, but parallel, profes
sors who will certainly bring an
added boost to thedepartment.

Alum to swing in Ballroom Friday night

From Staff Reports
Christopher Jentsch, a 1983
graduate of Gettysburg College,
will perform at the College's Jazz
Ensemble Homecoming Concert
on Friday, October 24, at 9 p.m.,
in the College Union Ballroom.
The concert is open to the public
and free of charge.
The Gettysburg College Jazz
Ensemble (GCJE) performance
will include swing standards and
classic ballads of Duke Ellington

and Count Basie, Latin-flavored
arrangements, and contemporary
fusion, as well as original com
position by Jentsch.
Jentsch is currently a per
forming and recording artist
working primarily in jazz and
contemporary improvisational
forms. After graduating from
Gettysburg College, he com
pleted a Master's degree in jazz
studies and contemporary media
at the Eastman School of Music.

He has composed jazz and
concert pieces, writing for cham
ber groups, big bands, and percus
sion and acoustic/electric en
sembles.
The GCJE is directed by
John "Buzz" Jones, Associate Pro
fessor of Music and director of
bands at Gettysburg College, as
well as the leader of the Buzz Jones
Big Band.
Jones is a composer himself.
His latest work, "Cymru: Hen

Wlad Fy Nhadau" (which means
"Wales: Land of My Fathers"),
premiered here at Gettysburg in
April. In addition to their 1997 Big
Band European Tour, the GCJE
also performed at intercollegiate
jazz festivals throughout Virginia,
Maryland, and Pennsylvania, as
well as for the Central Pennsylva
nia Friends of Jazz. Their new al
bum will be released on October
24.

Pacino saves Devil

Scent of a Woman ). One may
wonder whether the character's
name has anything to do with John
Milton, author of the classic Para
dise Lost, the story of Satan's de
ception of man.
While it is unclear if it is a
compliment, Pacino's smooth and
commanding aura allows him to
play a great Satan. Pacino looks
especially good compared to
Reeves.

Though all the bizarre
events are explained at the close
of the movie, one really has to
question whether it was all quite
necessary.
The same can be said for the
movie's direction. Though all was
drawn together at the end, there
were times when the action seems
to get away from the story line.
Both of the above problems
might have been averted if direc
tor Taylor Hackford (An
Officer and a Gentleman
) would have tried to keep

a stronger grip on the spe
cial effects in The Devil's
Advocate.
Though the movie's
^^_ final scene lost something
_^^H when the film projector
_^^H got too hot and ate the film
_^^H (ironically when John
^^| Milton was trashing God),
PPH Milton's final monologue
I I _f° ws and leads quite well
I _^H up to an explosive but truly
bizarre climax which would have
perhaps made a better ending than
the surprising, though fairly in
conclusive one in The Devil's Ad-

Reel Hits & Misses-

by Jon Froehhch
Staff Writer "Vanity is my favorite sin"
- John Milton
The Devil's Advocate starts
out normally enough. The clash
between small town and big shot
drives a talented, religious, young
man to the big city. Being a law
yer in this particular case, Kevin
Lomax, played by Keanu Reeves
(Point Break, Bill and Ted's Ex
cellent Adventure ), is | fl|
guided by invisible forces
from the closeness of his
Florida home town to the
man-eating streets of New
York City.
As one might guess
from the title of this
movie, the complications
Kevin encounters in "The
Big Apple" are a bit more J
potent than the usual fruit- _^
less quest for a parking _M
space. In fact, as audi- _^B
ences might predict, they're down
right evil.

The Devil s Advocate is re
ally the story of a lawyer who,
though unknowingly, literally
makes a deal with the devil.
Though Lomax's initial success
may be refreshing, audiences will
most likely have a strange feeling
that things are going a little too
well for him.
The root of Lomax's rise
and eventual fall can be identified
in the character of Milton, played
by Al Pacino (Donnie Brasco,

Though Reeves seemed bet
ter in this than many other previ
ous roles (in such forgettable mov
ies as Chain Reaction and A Walk
in the Clouds ), his inconsistent
Southern accent failed to prevent
some of Ted "Theodore" Logan
from seeping through.
Though fairly entertaining,
The Devil's Advocate did have two
persisting problems. It generally
lacked direction and was often a
little too weird and disturbing for
its own good.

vocate.
With good performances by
Pacino and Craig T. Nelson
(Coach ), coupled with a fairly
competent Keanu Reeves, this
movie will most likely entertain,
but it may be tough for some view
ers to enjoy.

Curtain Call
Roosters rebuttal

by Glen Beck
Staff Writer-
As both O&N President and
a person who enjoys theater, I felt
that I must comment on the Roost
ers review of two weeks ago.
I do not wish to put down
Ms. Greely because several of the
points she made were valid. I do,
however, have several problems
with her method of stating her be
liefs. She gives no reasoning be
hind her statements. For example,
Ms. Greely said that two of the
actors had no stage presence.
Fine, but what specifically about
their performances made her feel
this way? Similarly, why did she

feel the choreography of the hu
man roosters looked silly?
I would also like to com
ment on the statement that this was
the best play performed in Kline
but the worst performance of a
play. Apparently, Ms. Greely did
some research to know that
Abuelo was an added feature by
the director. However, the re
viewer should have dug farther. If
she had, she might have found out
more about the director's interpre
tation. Dr. _Mwschamp was in fre
quent contact with the author,
Milcha Sanchez-Scott, discussing
the addition of the grandfather,
which was actually meant to be a
distraction.

Likewise, Dr. Muschamp
spoke with Ms. Scott about the
Shadows, who were meant to be

seen as a stage presence.
Further, the reviewer should
have researched the concept of
"magic realism." At times, con
ventions such as poses, tableaus,
and _^deliberate movement' were
used to relay character relation
ships and intentions.

What is your opinion on course evaluations?

-Focus

by Rebecca Babbitt
Editor- in - Chief

Dear Casey..

Dear Casey,
I am having a problem. I
have a roommate I really like,
but I don't care for her boy
friend. It seems he's always in
the room; he's practically
moved in. The room is small for
two people as it is, and to make
matters worse, his friends are al
ways over as well and calling for
him at all hours of the night. I
am really getting annoyed at this
situation. What should I do?
Lost in the Room
Dear Lost in the Room,
This seems to go back to the
old adage: two is company and
three is a crowd, and your room is
seeming to get awful crowded
right now.
Let me emphasize again,
YOUR room. The room is tech
nically half yours, and you have
every right to defend your prop
erty.

One question I have for you
is, does your roommate realize
how annoyed you are getting at
this situation? If she does not, I
think you need to give her a few
quick slaps of reality, or you could
always take her to Wal-Mart and
buy her a clue.
Seriously, you should try to
explain to her how you feel that
your personal space is being vio
lated and that you would like to see
this situation changed.
Suggest that she go and visit
his domicile for a while. Ask if it
is really necessary that he lives
with you two in your ever-so-spa
cious living arrangements.

Howard in Gettysburg by Myles Price

Talk it out with your room
mate. If you have been passively
sitting by twiddling your thumbs,
this might have contributed to this
progressive problem.
As for the boyfriend's
friends, inform them that Mr. Joe
Wonderful does not live in this
room and do not try and reach him
there. You are going to have to
stand up for yourself in a situation
like this.
If all else fails, then it is time
for a demonstration of your an
noyance. Show them how obnox
ious they are. One method I have
found to be almost faultless is
playing Christmas music in Octo
ber at a high volume, while sing
ing along with the wrong words
or a Spanish version.
That may not be your style.
If that's the case, then invite your
friends over and throw a little
party, just as the two lovebirds are
about to go to sleep.

These examples might seem
extreme, but the point is that you
need to have your voice heard and
have your roommate not only re
alize your annoyance but under
stand it.
Dear Casey,
I went home for, Reading
Days, and I was able to see some
old friends. I had gone out of
state for college, and they have
stayed home. It seems that there
is a lot of distance between us
and that they are not the same
people as they were before. I am
upset about this space between
us. Do you have any advice?

Drifted Dear Drifted,
First, you need to realize
that the only thing that is perma
nent in life is change and that
change is truly inevitable. This
being said, change is sometimes
hard to deal with.
Another thing is that you
have probably changed as well,
not just your friends. You should
take that into consideration before
you are so quick to judge your
friends for changing.
There is an old saying: ab¬

sence makes the heart grow
fonder. Unfortunately, that is not
always the case, especially when
one goes away to college.
College is a time for chang
ing and growing, and you can not
let yourself get wrapped up in
what could have been, or what
should have been, and what is not.
Even though you and your
friends have grown apart, that does
not still mean you cannot be
friends. As they say, make new
friends and keep the old, one is
silver and the other, gold.

And be sure to remember
that friendship is a two-way road.
You can not expect your friends
to just sit back and watch you
grow and change while waiting
around for you to come home on
your vacations.
This advice is a bitter pill to
swallow, but it is the truth, and
more often than not, the truth
hurts. Any questions ? Send to Box
434.

Conflict and Consensus

To the Editor

First of all, I would like to
thank and commend Musselman
Hall residents for their diligent and
stupendous efforts during the re
cent fire caused by the careless
burning of candles. Too often we
tend to focus on the negative as
pects of an incident such as this,
and we forget to say thank you to
those who truly deserve it. The
residents of Musselman Hall were
incredible in helping one another
out during this crisis. In addition,
a big THANK YOU goes to the
officers and dispatchers working in

the Safety and Security office.
Their quick thinking and fast work
saved us all from potential disas
ter. Unfortunately sometimes,
when incidents like this occur,
there are often many inaccurate
rumors which somehow get spread
across campus. One such rumor
that has surfaced relates to "ran
dom" room searches. I would like
to put this in perspective, and to
acknowledge any responsibility I
or any other staff member had for
this misinformation. Contrary to

To the Editor:
This letter is in response to
last week's cover article titled,
"Party On." I must first commend
the author for accurately report
ing the story and giving Sigma
Alpha Epsilon its due credit for
handling the touchy situation. We
had a situation in which a student
from another college caused a dis
ruption in a crowded house. As
to not let the commotion spread
further, we promptly escorted the
individual out of our house. We
handled the incident impeccably
and kept the crowd's evacuation

calm and collective.
I must then delve deeper
and berate the editor for placing
this inconsequential story on the
cover of the Gettysburgian. One
would hope that there would be
much more important and press
ing issues to bless the cover of this
paper. Our fraternity, SAE, has
been working frivolously to eradi
cate the marred reputation that our
fraternity has endured. We have
been taking a more responsible
approach to social events and have
successfully had numerous parties
that have not had one bottle, can,

the recent letter to the editor, Secu
rity does not "randomly" search resi
dence hall rooms. Students, as ten
ants, are entitled to reasonable pri
vacy in College residence hall
rooms. However, the College does
make periodic inspections of and
maintenance visits to all college resi
dence hall rooms for reasons of
health, safety or possible policy vio
lations. Typically student staff mem
bers of Residence Life are respon
sible for dealing with related policy
violations. When possible, the stu
dent is present during this type of in
spection.
A search, as distinguished
from an inspection, involves a thor
ough examination of the residence
and personal possessions in relation
to a specific violation. A search is
undertaken only with the authoriza
tion of the Dean of the College, and
would never "randomly" occur.
I hope that this has helped to
clear the confusion.
Sincerely,

Christina N. Bell

or cup of alcohol. This is a success
ful advance in social events on this
campus and I believe we should be
recognized for this rather than events
that really have no significance. We
are conscious of our reputation on
campus and are working to change
the erroneous, but prominent, opin
ion of our fraternity. The Sigma Al
pha Epsilon of today is not the devi
ant SAE of years past. We are a
strong brotherhood trying to gain
positive notoriety.
Even though the story was ac
curately reported and relieved of all

responsibility, the mere placement of
the article on the cover of the Get
tysburgian, nonetheless damages our
image. My purpose of writing this
letter is to make the campus com
munity aware of the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon of today. We are a frater
nity trying to establish a positive and
cooperative image that will vanquish
past prejudices toward SAE. The in
cident that took place a couple of
weekends ago was an unforeseen oc
currence that was handled in a fault
less manner, but this story should not
be a cover article.

Consider this ...

Each semester at the end of
each course, every student is
given the opportunity to evaluate
the course, the teacher, and the
course materials. This exercise
gives each student the unique op
portunity to give unvarnished
opinions and possibly effect some
significant change.
Unfortunately, more often
than not, students either use these
evaluations as revenge against the
professor, or they do not bother
to put any time or effort into them.
Moreover, professors them
selves are often guilty of giving
evaluations, which can improve
their craft as teachers and their
courses, short shrift by handing
them out before the final exam or
waiting until the last ten minutes
of the last class.
Furthermore, there seems to
be a general apathy about the va
lidity and usefulness of these
evaluations both by students and
faculty.

However, Kallon v. Gettys
burg College, which is using these
evaluations as evidence, proves
that evaluations do have useful
ness outside of filling time on the
last day of class.
Yet, although this recent
case is proving that evaluations
can be useful to some end, there
is still the issue of getting the
evaluations to work for the good

of the college community.
How can the college com
munity as a whole reevaluate how
we use course evaluations to im
prove the quality of education here
at Gettysburg College?
For starters, the faculty and
administration of the college
should change how the evaluations
are used.
For one, the evaluations
should be handed out earlier than
the last class, and sufficient time
needs to be given to fill them out.
Further, each department
should revise their respective
evaluations keeping in mind cre
ating questions which give ad
equate opportunities to offer sub
stantive constructive criticisms.
Finally, the professors need
to sit down and consciously read
these evaluations not as assaults
but rather tools which can make
them better teachers.

As for all the students out
there, take the time to give some
meaningful commentary on your
courses and your professors.
So often students are left out
of the decision making process
when it comes to forming the sub
stance of their education, evalua
tions give you the opportunity to
make a change.
Gettysburg College is your
school, don't waste your opportu
nity to change it.

Voice IS an
INSTRUMENT

To the leaders of the new a
cappella group, Doug Walsh and
Jenny Bland... first of all congrats
on your endeavors to form a new
singing group on campus. Hav
ing just read the feature article
about you and your group, I find it
to be most exciting and long time
in coming. However, I found the
headline "Instruments? We don't
need no stinkin' instruments!"
quite offensive and in bad taste.
Don't forget, voice IS an instru
ment and your audience will be
comprised of, hopefully, hundreds
of music enthusiasts who love and
play instruments. The lack of his
torical research by yourselves, the
author of the article and senior,
Jonathon Black about singing
groups on this campus from early
days is disappointing. If you had
gone to the college archives, you
would have been pleased to dis
cover any number of such "a

cappella" groups in the past, and
used for the same purpose as in the
contemporary sense. The Gettys
burg College Choir has its roots in
a cappella singing, but choral lit
erature incorporating instruments
today has broadened and enhanced
that picture for us. As its director,
my first love is performing and lis
tening to a capella music. I was
blessed to have heard the current
famous five from Holland named
the Quinks last Monday night at
Mount Saint Mary's. They were
stupendous. Maybe you were
there? Should your group ever
reach that status, Gettysburg Col
lege will be on the musical map,
in spite of the Music Department.
There is an abundance of raw mu
sical talent on this campus... you
have the potential of success at
your finger... pardon me, vocal
tips! I can hardly wait to be "ser
enaded by (the) new a cappella
group"! Good luck!

Conflict and Consensus —
From The Pachyderm's Pulpit

Al Gore is no angel

On a sunny July day in 1992
outside the Arkansas Governor's
Mansion, a marriage made in me
dia heaven was made as Governor
Bill Clinton tapped Tennessee
Senator Al Gore to be his running
mate. Clinton and Gore at first
seemed to be very much alike.
Both were southern "New" Demo
crats, reasonably moderate, and
young. The picture that the Demo
crats wanted to portray was youth,
moderation, and a new generation
ready to take command. More
than any of that the Clinton team
put Al Gore on the Democratic
ticket because Senator Gore helped
erase Governor Clinton's nega
tives. While Bill Clinton dodged
the draft, Al Gore served in Viet
nam. Governor Clinton had his
share of sex scandals and Senator
Gore by all accounts had a very
strong marriage. As governor
Clinton's record on the environ¬

ment was very shady, and Al Gore
was loved by the environmental
ists, which has always been his pri
mary issue as shown by his book,
Earth in the Balance.
In 1992, the Clinton-Gore
campaign with their bus caravans
were instantly loved by the liberal
media. A new day had arrived, but
when the two landed in Washing¬

ton after dislodging President
George Bush and Vice President
Dan Quayle, Americans realized
that their new 43% president was
not exactly what they had ex
pected. He had caved in to the left,
lacked the leadership needed for
the Oval Office, and had a staff that
was not prepared for the Presi
dency. In 1994, the American
people punished President Clinton
and put Republicans in control of
Congress for the first time in forty

years. During the time while Bill
and first lady Hillary Clinton
(sorry, I mean Rodham-Clinton)
were being bashed over taxes,
healthcare, and scandals, "Honest"
Al Gore remained popular. The
president and vice president by all
accounts are very close. Vice
President Gore is one of the
president's closest advisors. It was
Al Gore who led the Reinventing
Government plan and it was the
vice president who has always
been there to deflect presidential
criticism. By 1996, there was no
question that Al Gore would once
again be on the Democratic ticket
and at the Chicago Convention he
was able to speak on his own night.
The talk was that the president was
going to work to help the vice
president receive the Democratic

Nomination for president uncon
tested in 2000.
Now the tables have turned
on the vice president, as he now
need the President Clinton's scan
dal cronies, who have been
through perhaps the most presiden
tial scandals in American Presiden
tial history. The latest scandal has
to deal with the selling of the presi
dency to domestic and foreign in
terests. The vice president is ac
cused of making calls for cam
paign cash on federal property
which is against the law.
The other offense being lev
eled at our good vice president is
his appearance at a Buddhist
temple for a fundraiser, an outright
violation of federal campaign laws
created after Watergate. For all the
bashing the Democrats give to the
Christian Coalition over cam¬

paigning in churches, Vice Presi
dent Gore is showing his true col
ors as a liberal hypocrite. While
claiming not to be aware of the fact
that it was a fundraiser where ille
gal foreign money was given, the
Vice President's schedule calls it a
fundraising event. The American
people are not stupid and now that
Attorney General "Stonewall"
Janet Reno has opened up an in
vestigation of Mr. Gore, perhaps
we can get to the truth over pos¬

sible espionage in the 1996 Presi
dential campaign.
The vice president earlier
this year looked foolish while an
swering questions over illegal acts
he may have committed last year.
In China, he was upstaged by
House Speaker Newt Gingrich
who had the courage to criticize
the Chinese over human rights
abuses, while Al Gore toasted the
butchers of Beijing. Just maybe
this was because they helped re
elect him and President Clinton
over a true American war hero,
Boh Dole.

Al Gore is getting his first
taste of negative press and he is
showing that he is not as savvy as
his ultimate politician partner, Bill
Clinton. While Al Gore slammed
big tobacco's support for the Re
publican Party, the Gore family
owns and operates tobacco farms.
If you listen to the Democratic
National Convention in 1992, Al
Gore was a working boy from ru
ral Tennessee. The truth is, Al
Gore was born, raised, and edu
cated in Washington, D.C. His fa
ther was a United States senator,
and since 1977 Al Gore has
worked in the Capitol.

The media blasted Mr.
Gore's predecessor, Dan Quayle,
over stupid things; they refuse to

do the same to Al Gore. When Al
Gore, in front of the cameras at
Montecello, asked who was the
painting of that he was looking at,
the response was George Washing
ton. Imagine if Dan Quayle had
done that. Furthermore, unlike Al
Gore who changed his position on
abortion to cater to the left, Dan
Quayle always stood up for what
he believed despite what liberals
yelled.
If Al Gore thinks the presi
dency is his in 2000, than there are
a few Democrats like House Mi
nority Leader Dick Gephardt,
former United States Senator Bill
Bradley, United States Senator
Bob Kerry, and Reverend Jesse
Jackson may have something to
say about that. They all have been
mistreated by the Clinton-Gore
team at one time or another and
now that Bill Clinton is finished
electorally, then Vice President
Gore will likely be their target.

If the vice president makes
it through the scandals and wins
his party's nod in 2000, then he will
have to face his biggest obstacle, a
Republican Party hungry to regain
the White House. The GOP has
not forgotten that it was President
Clinton's loyal sidekick Al Gore
who broke the tie in the Senate that
gave the largest tax increase in
American history.

everyone enjoyed their Reading
Days, and got a lot of work done.
We did. Anyway, First Year males
should look out for your rush
booklet which should be coming
in your mailboxes by the end of
next week. The booklet will con
tain information about each frater¬

nity on campus. It should be a
great way for First Years to get
better acquainted with the frater
nities, and for the fraternities to
portray themselves to the First Year
guys. Lambda Chi Alpha is con
tinuing their long tradition of par
ticipating in the North American
Food Drive (NAFD). This is the
largest single day food drive in
North America, and has been
Lambda Chi's annual philanthropy

project. This year Gettysburg s
Lambda Chi chapter has set a goal
to collect 3,000 pounds of nonper
ishable foods. Anyone, or any or

them out by contributing food or
money should contact Bill Burns
at x8358. The final day for col

don't wait too long.
Something to look out for in
the upcoming weeks is an all cam
pus party to be held behind Alpha

Tau Omega. Many organizations
on campus, including fraternities
and sororities have agreed to help
sponsor the event. There will be
no alcohol served, but bands will
be playing so there is no doubt that
it should be a great time. We will
have more details in the future as
boon as we get more info.
In case anyone forgot, this
weekend is Homecoming. That
means hundreds of alumni will be
back on campus, many of whom

were Greek, and are looking for
ward to visiting their houses, and
I'm sure they would prefer to see
them in pristine condition, so try
to clean up your houses for this
weekend.
To all sorority women, come
find out the recipients of the
scholar of the month at the next
Panhel meeting. The winners of
the service learning scholarships
will also be announced, so be sure
not to miss the meeting.

Conflict and Consensus —
From The Donkey's Mouth
Campaign finance, a serious issue

By Matt Brown
Contributing Writer
Has anyone noticed how
undemocratic our nation has be
come? Today, our nation's Repub
lican led Congress continues to
blatantly ignore the interests and
desires of the American people.
America wants and needs cam
paign finance reform. America
wants to see money lose influence
and issues gain influence in elec
tions. We want leaders who rep
resent us, not leaders who repre
sent a few political action commit
tees (PAC_'s) and privileged and
wealthy businessmen, doctors and
lawyers who contribute large sums
of money to their campaigns. The
majority of Americans want our
government to put an end to the
pervasive influence of money in
politics. Of course, it is a fantasy
to think that their will be a time
that money will be completely
eliminated from politics, but we

must be able to improve our sys
tem over the current one. Today
our system of campaign finance is
being abused by both the Demo
cratic and Republican parties as
they receive money from foreign
contributors. Today it has become
obvious that money does buy ac
cess to the _president. America
wants reform and Congress has yet
to deliver.
Isn't it funny that while Re
publicans attack and criticize our
current campaign finance system
in the investigation of the fund rais
ing practices of the Clinton/Gore
campaign, that these same Repub
licans are the ones blocking reform
on these very same issues in the
Senate. These hypocrites obvi
ously do not care about campaign
finance reform, all they care about
is furthering their own political
agenda by trying to drag out the
president's unethical fund raising
Dractices to weaken him. The Re¬

publicans continue to preach about
how corrupt the system was, yet
most of them continue to do noth
ing about it. Meanwhile, President
Clinton and Vice-President Gore,
the "guilty"-parties continue to
push for reform. Why do the Re
publicans practice this kind of hy
pocrisy? Because they don't want
to bite the hands that feed them.
The Republicans who consistently
raise more money than Democrats
don't want to damage the system
that has traditionally benefitted
them. In their greed, they continue
to block reform. Republicans are
guilty of the kind of things the
president has done too, it just so
happens that Chairman Fred Th
ompson continues to abuse com
mittee rules surprising the Demo
crats on the committee, led by
Senator John Glenn with subpoe
nas and preventing the Democrats
from issuing the subpoenas they
want. The Republicans gloss over

the fact that they received money
from Hong Kong and are seeking
to cover up the outbreak of a Japa
nese money scandal. The party
leading the charge in the investi
gation is also a coconspirator in
the abuse of the system. Their op
position is based on the opinion
that if you limit the amount of
money a person can contribute you
limit their right to free speech.
Well, if speech is equivalent to
money, then a small and privileged
few are able to talk a whole lot
louder and longer than the major
ity of us nearly mute Americans.
Not all Senate Republicans
are guilty of hypocrisy. In fact,
Republican Senator John McCain
of Arizona has written a bill that
would reform our system. How
ever only a handful of brave Re
publicans and the Democrats in the
Senate support it, not enough to
muster the 60 votes that they would
need to break Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott's filibuster. Lott

has vowed that campaign finance
reform will not come from this
session of Congress. So what can
we do now, when the Republican
leadership has vowed to never re
lent in its opposition to campaign
finance reform? Well we could all
call ourcongresspersons and sena
tors and let them know that
America demands campaign fi
nance reform. Or next year we
could make history. We could
make history by electing a Demo
cratic controlled House, the first
time ever that the president's party
would gain seats during midterm
elections. That event along with
getting enough Senators Democrat
or Republican that support reform
would finally bring about the
change that we want and need.
Everyone can see that the systems
broken, but we do not have the
leadership in Congress to fix it.
America needs a new Congress, a
Democratic congress to bring
about real change.

To the Editor: Student blasts Burgian

To the editors of The Gettys
burgian,
My name is James
McCusker and I am a second se
mester senior at Gettysburg Col
lege. I was readmitted at the start
of this semester, after being away
from the college for three years,
and in the time that I have been
away I am shocked and saddened
by the deterioration of the Gettys
burg College school newspaper,
The Gettysburgian. I will use the
most recent October 9 issue as an
example. In the Oct 9 issue the
mistakes, omissions and quality of
the articles was pathetic. The back
page sports article reported on the
football team's loss to Johns
Hopkins but never even reported a
final score!!! Instead the reporter
seemed too interested in being the
Chris Berman of print as he tries
to annoyingly give every Bullet

player a nickname. I can under
stand some omissions but lack of
a final score is unforgivable. On
page 17 there was a small article
reporting on the debut of the
women's rugby team, once again
not only was there no final score
reported, but the article was cut off
mid-sentence!!! Then on page 12
there was the article on Greek
Week. Again, the article was un
clear as to which fraternity/soror
ity were the overall winners. The
article listed winners of the indi
vidual events but no overall win
ner. The closest it came was to stat
ing "The final standings were as
follows. For the men, finishing in
third was Fiji, while Sigma Nu fin
ished in second." First, the sen
tence does not clear up whether the
winners mentioned were in regard
to the airbands or for all of Greek
Week and second, it lists the third

and second place fraternities but no
first place winner is listed!!!
At the same time The Get
tysburgian reviews a movie "Clue"
which came out 12 years ago!!!
Hello!!!! The freshman were 6
years old when this movie was on
the big screen!!! It was panned
then as it should have been for be
ing a truly bad movie. Why are
we concerning ourselves with it
now? Meanwhile the school and
the newspaper are concerning
themselves with the same old tired
issue of drinking that they have for
the last 15 years. This is not to
say that drinking is a non-issue, but
there is nothing new about the re
porting or the problem and every
one acts like students drinking is a
new phenomena and problem at
Gettysburg and it is not. The col
lege restricts fraternity parties,
clamps down on drinking in

dorms, provides no school sup
ported or regulated social gather
ings where alcohol is served and
then has the nerve to wonder why
there is an increase in off-campus
parties!!! Wake up for gods sake!!!
Students are going to find a way
to party and blow off steam, the
best thing the school could do is
provide a supervised environment
to reduce underaged drinking and
ensure no one gets hurt. While The
Gettysburgian was pondering the
student drinking "problem" for the
50,000 time, a real story of national
interest was taking place about the
Gettysburg battlefields and the
controversy surrounding the park
service and it's plans for private
investment and development. This
story was covered with a full page
article in USA Today and a 2
minute piece on NBC National
News with Tom Rrokaw. but did

the Gettysburgian cover it?
Shamefully, no.
I understand that Gettysburg
College does not have a journal
ism school and that The Gettys
burgian is going through some for
mat changes but these problems
are inexcusable. In the three years
that I have been away from Get
tysburg, I have been working as an
assistant producer at CBS News,
and I would be ashamed to show
this newspaper to any of my co
workers as a representation of my
alma mater. One of the first things
I learned when working on my
high school newspaper was in your
article always remember to report
"who, what, where, when and
why" perhaps this should be re
minded to the staff of The Gettys
burgian.
Sincerely,
James McCusker





Cross Country teams leave their mark

by Peter Huminski
Staff Writer The Bullet cross country
teams were busy competing the
last two weeks in the Dickinson
Invitational on October 11 and the
Allentown Invitational on October
18. There was a lot for the Bul
let harriers to pleased about this
past weekend. The men's team
finished fourth with 189 points,
behind first place Haverford (34
points).
Running for the second
week in a row without top fresh
man Jon Catlett, the Bullet men
put together an excellent team
race. There were only SO seconds
separating the Bullets' first six
runners.
"It is the best meet the guys
team has had since the beginning
of September," said Bullets coach
Robert Condon.

The Bullets were led by se
nior Jason Smith, who finished
23rd in a time of 27:32. He was
followed by James Smith (28th,
27:40), Kris Weum (39, 27:58),
Brendon Clark (46, 28:11), Dave
Gary (53,28:20), Brian Rusignolo
(55,28:22), and Ken Lodge (109,
29:33).
In the women's race senior
Wendy Johnston paced the Bullets
to a fourteenth place finish out of
33 teams. Bloomsburg won the
team title with 56 points. Johnston
finished fifthteenth overall in a
time of 19:36. She was closely
followed by Martie Calello (31,
20:08), Joyce O'Neil (86, 21:14),
and Karen Helmick (104, 21:39).
Freshman Kim Heimerl, Kristin
Mills, and Junior Krissy Snell
rounded out the Bullets top seven.
"Wendy looked the best she
has in few weeks," said Condon.
"She had a real strong finish, but
was just unable to make up the

ground on the top kids."
"Both teams ran pretty
well," said Condon. "Both teams
have been pretty tired for the lasl
couple of weeks. The importanl
thing is that they have their legs
back underneath them. We have a
ways to go until the Regional
meet." Over Reading Days while
most of us were heading home the
Bullet harriers competed in the
Dickinson Invitational. The Bul
let men finished sixth in the 36
team field, while the women fin
ished eleventh in the 33 team field.
The College of New Jersey won
the men's race and CMU was vic
torious for the women.
The Bullet men were led by
lason Smith and James Smith who
finished 24th and 25th respec
tively. Weum, Gary, Rusignolo,
George Torgun, and Clark
rounded out the top seven finish
ers for the Bullets.

Rusignolo has slowly
worked his way back into the top
seven after a slow start to the sea
son. "Brian didn't jump back into
his training too fast," said Condon.

in his last race. He is solid and

Johnston once again led the
Bullet women finishing thirteenth
in 19:26. Calello finished
eighteeth overall in 19:47. O'Neil
finished third for the Bullets and
101 overall in 21:42. Mills,

Today, marks the date of the
first ever "B.A.S.S. Bulletin." To
start off the season we must first
recognize the most important team
we have: the Gettysburg training
team. Amie Ashley, a member of
the many individuals among the
group explains her part in the

mending process. Amie is cur
rently the President of the Train
ers Club.
In a few words, the Trainers
Club is an organization of student
athletic trainers, used to get the
students better oriented with the
different doctors in the area.
The organization also works
with local schools for the Ameri
can Heart Association. As Presi

campus events, i.e. the American
Heart Association, and must also
make the decisions on the fund
raisers in which to partake.
What makes the club so
beneficial is that it gives better ex
posure to her major, and she feels
that hands on experience really
helps. Not to mention that she can
meet others with similar interests
and gain good connections for the
future.

Amie was always certain
about her future in this field. She
was an athlete before her time was
taken over by studies and always
enjoyed being around athletes.
As for her future, Amie as
pires to go to graduate school at
Columbia University and procure
a masters degree in Physical
Therapy. Athletic training is al
ways something she can fall back
on.

Golf team driving away Centennial
Conference oppositon

by Rick Deutsch
Contributing Writer
The golf team's impressive
showing at Bent Creek Country
Club in Lancaster, Pennsylvania
last Monday meant much more
than just wins and losses. Prior to
Monday, the Bullets hadn't placed
higher than sixth in either of their
two previous tournaments, one of
which was played.at their home

course, Gettysburg Country Club.
The team tied for third in a
field of eight teams as Millersville
B team and Millersville A team
took home first and second place
finishes, respectively. Even
more promising for the S
Bullets is the fact that _S
Millersville teams _S
play Division II ath- V

letics, including
golf. B e n ti
Creek's tight fair
ways, slick I
greens, tough pin I
placements, and a
plethora of OB
markers made for
some very high
numbers on many
scorecards. This
proved to be an ad
vantage for the Bul
lets as they kept
their high numbers
at a minimum and
turned in low scores,
relative to the pack
of 40 plus players.
Low man for
the Bullets was
junior Matt '
Beclcert who fired a

10-over 81, a score which earned
him fifth place in the individual
standings. Freshman John
Hargreaves, sporting his back
wards orange Bullets hat, shot a
solid 84.
Sophomore Rick Deutsch
carded a respectable 87 with se
nior Hunter Leahey close behind
with an 88.

Previously this season, the
Bullets placed a disappointing six
out of 11 teams as they hosted
their annual Gettysburg Invita
tional. Bright spots were
Beckert's six-over 77, and solid
play from freshman sensations
Joel "I'm not related to Coach or
Barb" Streeter and Casey Martin
who each carded 81's.

_^H team should have
_^H capitalized on the
_^H _^ advantage of being
_^^^^^ familiar with each
_^^^^_T hole, which the
^^^ Bullets failed to do.
In their only other tourna
ment this season, the team fell
prey to Hershey East's long and
intimidating holes and placed a
miserable eight out of a pack of
12 teams. Having only had two
players on the squad who had pre
viously played Hershey hurt the
Bullets as well.

Possibly distracted by the
overpowering and unrelenting
smell of chocolate in the air, none
of the five Bullet starters ever got
his swing together. Low scores for
the Bullets were turned in by
Streeter and Deutsch who each
fired 89's.
This week's turnaround at
Bent Creek not only marks the
first time the Bullets put more

ing season.
The Bullets still feel they
plenty of talent and all the
it takes to be a winning team

have tools

and equally important, Centennial
Conference Champions. Head
Coach Casey Counseller stressed
that the team needs to work on a
shot-by-shot approach to their
rounds and gain more of an ag
gressive and competitive attitude
to win.
_Counselor's theory is to for
get the bad shot you may have just
hit and not hit six more consecu
tive bad shots, but rather to re
member that each swing is a sepa
rate entity from the one before it.
Counseller remains confi
dent in his team and stresses his
theories before and after each
match. After Bent Creek, he gave
the team a few words of wisdom.
He first stated that he feels the
_y team could win every tour
Bfttament if everyone would

remain focused on their goal.
Then, for a refresher, he re
minded everyone of their main
objective. "Guys, what you need
to remember is that what you are
trying to do out there...is to get the
ball in the hole in as few strokes
as possible."
Sound advice, coach. If the
team keeps progressing and fol
lows that plan, it should be win
ning many tournaments very soon.

The second half or play by
the _Bulletsivas equally as impres
sive as the first half. Adam
Outeridge and Jim Nastashi both
scored a goal to further strengthen
the Bullet lead. With this win the
Bullets are now 9-3-1 overall, and
3-0-1 in conference play.
They are now currently
ranked third in the region and are
ranked twentysecond in the na
tion. The Bullets next game is an
away game at Catholic University
on October 23, at 3:30.
Other Notes: On October 4,
the Bullets rocked Haverford
College's world. Goals were
scored by Chris Pryor, Jessie
Flynn, and Jason Vishio.
On October 15, the Bullets
spanked Wesley College 6-2.
There were six different goal scor
ers for the Bullets. They included:
Chris Pryor, Jim Green, Adam
Outeridge, Jim Natashi, Jason
Vishio, and Jeremy Shapiro.

On October 18, at 4:00
p.m., the Gettysburg soccer team
took on Ursinus at home in con
ference play. The Ursinus team
left town utterly defeated as the
Bullets rolled over the Bears 6
1. The offense once again
showed its dominance as it has
recorded 12 goals in the last two
games.
The Bullets' defense also
demonstrated their power as they
allowed only a small number of
shots. The Bullets acted quickly
in the first half as they jumped
out to a 4-0 lead. Greg Stevcic
had two goals, while Chris Pryor
and Matt Kelly each scored one
goal. Goal keeper John Katerba
had a great first half as he shut
out the Bears.

Bears and bees take bite out of Bullets

by Peter Huminski
Staff Writer The Gettysburg Bullets
dropped their third game in a row
Saturday when the Bullets lost to
Ursinus, 13-2.
The Bullets were held deep
in their own territory for most of
the game only accumulating 230
total yards of offense.
The vaunted Bullets running
game was limited to 124 yards by
the Bears defense.
Gettysburg trailed 7-0 in the
third quarter when the Bullets de
fense came up big. Ursinus quar
terback Craig Messick handed off
to running back Joe Conte who
was met in the end zone by a wait
ing safety Kevin Gurski. Gurski
led the Bullets with ten tackles.
The Bullets now trailed, 7
2, but were forced to punt after
only three plays on the ensuing
free kick.

The Bears then put the game
out of reach by marching 75 yards
on 11 plays and scored on a Joe
Nangle two-yard touchdown run.
The Bears accumulated over 300
yards of offense against the Bul
lets and improved their record to
3-4 overall, and 2-3 in the confer¬

ence. Fullback Paul Smith led the
Bullets rushing offense with 51
yards on 16 carries. Smith was
also Gettysburg's top receiver
catching three passes for 51 yards.
In only his second start
freshman quarterback Dennis
Flaherty completed 8-29 passes
for 106 yards in the air. Flaherty
spread the receiving wealth com
pleting passes to Smith, Jeff Closz,
Mike Holm, Matt Helwig, and
Tighe Burns. The loss drops he
Bullets to 2-4 on the season, and
1-3 in the Centennial Conference.

It was another long day for
the Gettysburg faithful who stuck
around to watch the Bullets over
Reading Days. Randolph Macon
came calling to Musselman sta
dium Saturday, October 11 and
steamrolled the Bullets 44-13.
The score, however, does
not indicate how well the Bullets
played. Trailing 10-0 in the first
quarter the Bullets got fired up and
scored a touchdown on a 56 yard
pass to Jeff Closz from freshman
quarterback Dennis Flaherty.
On the Yellow Jackets next
possession the Bullets defense
came up big. Defensive end Jus
tin Domingos sacked Yellow
Jacket quarterback Sidney
Chappell forcing a fumble which
Domingos recovered.

The Bullets were in business
on the Randolph Macon 16 yard
line. Two rushing plays each by
Paul Smith and Matt Helwig got
the Bullets down to the 3 yard line.
On third and goal Flaherty rolled
right out of the pocket and found
Smith for his second touchdown
pass of the game to give the Bul
lets a 13-10 lead with 12:14 to go
in the first half.
This was as close as the Bul
lets would be able to get as the Yel-

low Jackets scored two more start Flaherty completed 12 of 24

touchdowns in the first half to
make the score 24-13 at the half.
The Bullets were unable to
sustain any momentum in the sec
ond half as the offensive line was
unable to open up any holes for
Smith and Helwig to run through.
The Bullets came into
Saturday's game ranked fourteenth
in rushing offense with 269.8
yards a game. The swarming Yel
low Jacket defense only allowed
the Bullets to gain 42 yards on the
ground.
"Their offense made a lot of
plays," said Bullets Head Coach
Barry Streeter. "We showed some
signs in the first half, but we're just
not making the plays defensively."
The Bullets defense made
some plays in the first half but was
unable to stop the experienced Yel
low Jacket offense. The Jackets
gained 575 yards in total offense.
Randolph Macon had a very bal
anced attack passing for 288 yards
and rushing for 287 yards.

"I thought Dennis Flaherty
did a lot of good things," said
Streeter. "He got all the repetitions
with the first group in practice. His
timing was better and he showed
some poise."
Freshman quarterback Den
nis Flaherty was a bright spot for
the Bullets. In his first collegiate

passes for 164 yards and two
touchdowns.
Flaherty's favorite target
was Closz who finished the game
with 100 yards on four catches and
one touchdown.
"It's going to be a battle un
til the end," said Streeter. "If you're
going to fight, you have to fight
four quarters."
The Bullets (2-4, 1-3 in
Centennial Conference) will have
their chance to fight again this Sat
urday when they host Muhlenberg
this Saturday in Musselman Sta
dium at 1:00 p.m.

Hit me with your best "Schott"
Sophomore Cat Schott "kills " Centennial Conference Competition

"The
team is a
great
bunch of
girls."

by Chesha Miller
Staff Writer

There are few people that
would go out of their way for any
one else and who always place
themselves behind others. Sopho
more volleyball player Catherine
Schott is one of those rare people.
Catherine, who is affection
ately called Cat, is one of the nic
est and most caring people you
will ever meet. "I am a good lis
tener," Schott said, "if anyone, a
teammate or friend, needs a shoul
der to lean on, or someone to lis
ten to them, they can always come

Although she has these
qualities, she is still a very com
petitive person who is willing push
herself and those around her to do
their best. Schott began her ath
letic career as a sixth grader, par
ticipating in volleyball, basketball,
and track.
Throughout her years at
Montrose High School in Colo
rado, Catherine was always par
tial to track but that eventually
changed. "Volleyball was just a
sport to play," explained Schott, "I
didn't expect it to be so much fun."
Aside from volleyball being so
enjoyable for Catherine, she also
has immense talent.
During her sophomore year
at Montrose, she was approached
by a recruiting service who helped
convince Schott to play volleyball
in college and to help her find the
right place for her.

The recruiting service sug
gested Gettysburg because of its
combined academic and athletic
strength. "I was really happy to
find a place where academics
come first and then athletics,"
Catherine explained, "there is a
good balance between the two
here." Gettysburg was just as lucky
to find Catherine as she was to find
Gettysburg. In a little less than a
year and a half, Schott has made
quite an impression on campus.
An honor student and consistent
Dean's List honoree, Catherine
finished up her freshman year with
an impressive 3.7 grade point av
erage, placing her very near the
top of her class.

This also enabled Catherine
to join Alpha Lambda Delta, an
honor society for superior aca
demic achievement during the first
year of college. Catherine has had
an equally impressive first two
volleyball seasons at Gettysburg.
As a first year student she
made the first All-Regional and
All-Centennial Conference teams,
was named as Centennial Confer
ence player of the week, and was
also named to the All-Tournament
team at every tournament Gettys
burg played, including both of
Gettysburg's own tournaments.
The middle blocker ended
last season ranked sixth in the na
tion for hitting percentage. She is
presently ranked second in the na
tion for hitting percentage and
17th for kills per game.

When you talk to Schott, she
won't tell you about any of her ac
complishments. In fact, she hardly
talks about herself, and when she
talks about volleyball she simply
speaks about the team. Gettysburg
College volleyball coach Kim
Rain explained, "Cat is not a cocky
person, she is definitely very mod
est and alsovery team oriented.
It is so nice to have some
one like that." Rain describes

coaching Catherine as "a once in
a lifetime experience." Schott is
extremely hard working and she
always goes above and beyond
what is required to be sure she is
getting the most out of her athletic
experience.
She understands that she

still has a lot to learn and is al
ways willing to listen to the ad
vice of her coaches. "Cat is a lis
tener and really takes our advice
into stride." said Rain, "she never

questions our judgments and al
ways goes after what she wants."
On the flip side Schott also
knows how to have fun and enjoy
her sport. "She A "s silly," Coach
Rain said laughing, "she's becom
ing really outgoing and is totally
opening herself up to the team."
Catherine's teammates are really
impressed by the combination of
her great attitude and competitive
edge. Catherine has a lot of respect
and admiration for her teammates
and coaches as well.
"Last year was a transition
year for all of us [as we got new
coaches]," says Schott, "Coach
Rain and Coach Armocost made
the adjustment fun for all of us,
and they are continuing to do so."
Schott_'s attitude towards volley
ball is to take one game at a time.
Though very competitive,
Schott only worries about the task
at hand, instead of concentrating
on future games. "I do stupid
things to make volleyball a fun
sport," says Schott, "It A "s an out
let for me and is not my whole
life." For this season Catherine A "s
goal is to accomplish the team
goals, which were set at the be
ginning of the season, and to con
tinue to have fun playing volley¬

ball. "The team is a great bunch
of girls," said Schott, "we have a
lot of fun together both on and off
the court." Catherine does look
into the future in other aspects of
her life. She is a political science
and Spanish double major, who is
planning to become a lawyer.
At this time she is leaning
towards criminal law and a prac
tice as a trial attorney but that
could change at any time. During
the spring semester of her junior
year Catherine plans to go to
Spain. The study abroad is re
quired by all Spanish majors, but
would also give Schott the long
awaited opportunity to travel to
Europe.
Schott attributes her hard
work and dedication to her parents
Pat and Paul Schott. "I've always
been able to talk to my parents and
to take advice from them. They let
me lead my own life and make my
own decisions, while supporting
me no matter what I do. I've re¬

ally modeled my life after them,
she says. Catherine is also really
close to her brother Justin who is
in the Air Force.
The pair is always there to
check up on each other and offer
constructive criticism. In addition
to playing volleyball and being a
member of Alpha Lambda Delta,
Catherine is a member of ALLIES
and the Spanish club. Last year
she took partin the survivor's train
ing course.
After completing 12 hours
of volunteering at a shelter, in ad
dition to the 48 class hours already
completed, Catherine will be a
certified domestic violence and
rape counselor. "It was a really
good class to take," explains
Catherine, "I gained a lot of im
portant knowledge." This knowl
edge epitomizes Catherine's desire
to place others needs ahead of her
own. "Cat is a great person. She
always goes out of her way to help
fellow teammates and students if
she can," noted Rain. Catherine
Schott is the type of person who
will make a difference in the
world, just as she has at Gettys
burg.

This is no "Bull"

by Steve Jenkins
Sports Editor
Before reading the follow
ing article, you may want to brace
yourself for information that may
be unsuitable for dedicated basket
ball fans. If you have trouble with
the graphic content of this article,
please turn your paper lo another
page, and try to refrain from in
tense emotional public outbursts.
Okay, here it is... Michael
Jordan had surgery.
Yes, all the rumors are true.
Michael Jordan, perhaps the great
est basketball player of all time,
is in stable condition after having
two ingrown toenails removed. (If
you didn't catch the sarcasm there,
there was some intended.)
Jordan the NBA's nine time
scoring champ, will miss the last
remaining Chicago Bulls pre
season games against Philadelphia
on Wednsday, Philadelphia again
on Friday, and lastly Saturday
against Sacramento.

Jordan though thoroughly
traumatized by the incident said,
"It was decided that it was better
for me to have the toenails re
moved now and thus be ready for
the opening of the season. I'm
looking forward to being back on
the court next week and starting

the defense of our championship.
"What does Jordan think he
is doing anyway? He is not al
lowed to go and get hurt. He is
the only reason that half the fans
watch professional basketball any
way. When people turn on the TV,
they do not want to see "Thunder"
Bob Thorton shooting a two
handed jumper over Kurt
Nymphius.
They want to see " slam,
bam, I'm gonna shoot, dribble,
dunk, stuff, turn,pass, twist, glide,
and sail right past you and you are
going to like it" Michael Jordan.
As far as alot of professional
basketball fans are concerned
there should be a some kind . of
NBA regulation against Michael
Jordan having surgery. Something
in his contract that would read:
"Michael is not allowed to partici
pate in any surgical procedure or
medical practice no matter the se
verity of injury because frankly he
is too damn important to the

I mean hey, when reading
the contract Michael would be so
distracted by the number three and
the seven zeros that follow it (in
the salary paragraph) that the little
clause about "no surgery" may be
somewhat insignificant.
Many people would pay no

attention to a clause like the one
above, if right next to it, the para
graph read: "We will pay you $30
MILLION dollars for one season."
Would you read over it? Me too.
Have no fear. This time,
luckily, Jordan will be suited up
and ready to play in the season
opener on October 31. It will take
about two weeks for Jordan's "toe
sy, woe-sies to get all better" and
then he will be back to continue
on with the professional basketball
dynasty that has become the Chi
cago Bulls.

If you are a basketball fan,
and you read through the entire
article then you are to be com
mended and congratulated. As
hard as it was to write, it was even
harder to read as the truth.
So, don't let this article get
into the wrong hands or mass
histeria could break out all over
campus. Jordan will be back, and
hopefully the loss of a few extra
pieces of toenail will not throw off
his game. Oh yeah, that is right,
Jordan shoots over guys a foot
taller than him... I don't think he'll
be having any problems.

Who will be back at Homecoming to see Tom Olchon make
spectacular plays like this at homecoming? Has homecoming
lost it's luster?

Home Sweet Gettysburg

By Josh Eyler
Assistant Sports Editor

the high school dances and the se
niors that I knew last year who will
be returning, but most of all I think
about the football game that ev
eryone attended religiously to
cheer on the team. The Home
coming Game was a monument,
an institution, I know that many
people feel the same way.
However, no one embraces
these feelings more deeply than
the football alumni that will return
this weekend to watch their Bul
lets play once again. These men
get to come "home" to visit the
field where they bled, dripped
sweat, won, and lost. At the time
it was everything to them.
Now, it is just a fond
memory. Who, that once put on
the pads and helmets, will return
this weekend? Perhaps those
players who are now famous will
return, such as Pete Draovitch,
who is the personal trainer for the
tremendous golfer Greg Norman
or Scott Dudak, who is getting in-

Yesterday I began to think
about Homecoming and what it
means here at Gettysburg. First, I
pulled out my dusty old Webster's
Dictionary, and one of the defini
tions for the word homecoming
was "an annual celebration for
alumni at a college or university."
In the most basic sense, that is ex
actly what will happen this week
end. More importantly, though,
homecoming is defined as "a re
turn home." For many of the
alumni that will return this week
end, Gettysburg is the home of the
memories that they hold dearest to
their hearts. This is where they
made the friends that have lasted
a lifetime and where they had the
type of good times that can never
be retrieved.
When I personally think
about homecoming, I remember

ducted into Gettysburg's Hall of
Honor this weekend.
Maybe the long list of awe
some captains will be at good old
Musselman Stadium to watch
their team: those such as Rod
Albright, Bryant "The Bulldog"
Meckley, Harry Cooper, and Chris
Notarfrancesco. By chance, even
the unsung heroes may return,
such as Chuck Seidenstricker, who
played in the trenches from '68 to
72, or John Buskirk, who played
all four years despite the fact that
he had two major knee surgeries.
Personally, I hope that they
all come. I hope that they take as
much joy in watching this year's
Bullets pound the Mules from
Muhlenberg as they once had
when they themselves were wear
ing the orange and blue. But most
of all I hope that Homecoming for
these guys, as well as all of the
alumni, is a special one, because
"returning home" should always
be a meaningful experience.
