TKE renovations to begin

Brothers set to move back into house in fall semester

By Laura Root
Staff Writer After months of prepa
ration, the Tau Kappa Epsilon
fraternity is ready to begin re
pairing its house.
Alumnae donations are
adding up and the renovations
are planned to begin this
spring and continue into the
summer. TKE brothers are
planning on moving in next
fall. Currently, all fraternity
members are living in off
campus locations.
When $50,000 worth of
damage was done to the fra
ternity house lastspring, it was
immediately closed down.
The damage to the
house was caused last semes
ter during final's week, when
a number of Tau Kappa Epsi
lon brothers caused a great
deal of damage to their own
residence.

Renovations for the
house had been scheduled pre
vious to the incident, but were
pushed back because of the
amount of damage done to the
house.
The repairs include add
ing sprinklers, fire escapes,
and improving the quality of
the rooms inside the house.

Because of the incident,
which forced TKE to close
down its house, the fraternity
brothers have been looking into
' ways to deter such destructive

behavior.
Brothers have undergone
interviews with the national
chapter of TKE. National lead
ers of TKE have suggested new
rules and codes of conduct for
its Gettysburg College chapter.
Additionally, punish
ments for poor behavior will be
enacted more harshly than they
have in the past.
The problems that TKE
has had have tarnished its repu
tation both on the local and na
tional levels. However, the
members are working hard to
change the perception that
people might currently have of
it. Professor John
Commito, the faculty advisor to
TKE, is working hard to keep
the academic performance of
its members exemplary. Danny
Smith, TKE president, and the
rest of the fraternity have been
working hard on service
projects for the Gettysburg
community.

"We are trying our hard
est to repair the damages," says
Smith, "and all the brothers
will be happy to move back into
TKE next fall."

Living with HIV

Early treatment the key to living longer with the virus

by Darcy Daniels and
Miranna Smith
Contributing Wuters
You were worried about
HIV. You had a few close en
counters. You got tested and
you found out that you are
HIV positive. All of your
worst fears have been con
firmed. You are afraid, you
fee] alone, and you don't know
where to turn. What do you
do now? This news can be
very shocking, but it is impor
tant to face this crisis and learn
how to live with HIV.
The subject of AIDS and
HIV is a very personal, confi
dential topic. It is also very
scary. There is a large support
network that you can turn to
that can help you sort out your
feelings.
If you don't feel com-

I fortable discussing this with
your family or friends, there
are people on campus that
are available to discuss your
fears with you. Their names
have been printed in this is
I sue of the Gettysburgian.
You can also call your local
HIV/AIDS service organi
zation, because they can re
fer you to a physician or
, clinic experienced in the
[ care of HIV/AIDS patients.
You now have to live
your life differently. Many
people live long lives once
they find out they are HIV
positive, but the key to long
life is early intervention.
You need to find out what
combination of treatment
may be right for you. You
need to go see a doctor to
discuss your options.
Besides seeing a doc¬

tor, there are more personalized
steps that you can take such as
eating a balanced diet. Good nu
trition can help your body fight
infections.
Rest is also essential for the
body to renew strength, resist ill
ness, and relieve stress.
Exercise, good hygiene,
and avoiding drugs and alcohol
are three important steps to help
you lead a healthy lifestyle.
Finding out that your are
HIV-positive is critical to your
relationships with others. HIV is
spread through blood, semen,
breastmilk and vaginal fluid.
This means that it can be
spread to others during sex, by
sharing needles, or during preg
nancy. You can reduce the risk of
transmittal to others by using la¬

tex condoms, every time, if you
decide to have sex. Though they
do not eliminate the risk of infect
ing someone else, it highly re
duces the risk.
Other important prevention
factors include never sharing
needles, razors or toothbrushes,
not donating blood, and telling
your partner and your health care
providers about your infection.
You are not alone in your
crisis. You have a lot of informa
tion, a lot of support, and a lot of
love from your family and
friends. Hopefully, a cure is in
sight, but in the meantime, be re
sponsible for yourself and others.

A record number of minor
ity students earned doctorates at
American universities, according
to a new study by the National
Research Council.
Black, Hispanic, Asian and
American Indian students re
ceived 3,542 Ph.D. _" s in 1996, up
from 3,517 in 1995. The num
ber of doctoral degrees awarded
to American minority students
rose in each ethnic group, except
for Asian Americans.
Black Americans received
1,315 doctorates last year, while
American Indians earned 186.
Puerto Ricans earned 251
Ph.D.'s; Mexican Americans 282;
and other Hispanics_, 417.
White Americans earned
slightly fewer Ph.D.'s in 1996
23,956 down from 23,920 in
1995. The same was true of
Asian Americans, who received
1,091 doctorates last year, com
pared with 1,140 in 1995.

for about 40 percent of the de
grees awarded in 1996, earning
16,945 degrees, up from 16,414
in 1995.
Women earning doctorates
outnumbered men in education
and in the social sciences. In the
humanities, women earned nearly
Ph.D.'s as men: 2,544 women
compared with 2,572 men.
Men dominated in engi
neering, the physical sciences and
life sciences. Men, for example,
earned 5,529 Ph.D.'s in engineer
ing, while women received 776.

Celebrating in style

by Cara Masucci
Staff Writer After the last dishes are
cleared from the table on
Thanksgiving, everyone is
looking forward to the upcom
ing holiday season. Whether
it is for Christmas, Hanukkah,
or Kwanza, decorations are
hung from all corners of the
house. Walking down the
street, one is greeted with
bright lights and well-known
symbols of the holidays. Gifts
are exchanged, and families
gather together to give thanks
for their happiness. It becomes
a custom to every person,
young and old.
Christmas is probably the
best known holiday of the year,
due to the fact that a majority
of the country celebrates it. It
is the day that Christians cel¬

ebrate the birth of Jesus Christ,
the Son of God, who was born

into the world to save people
from original sin. It is a day of
great rejoicing across the world
for many Christians. Many
families gather together to cel
ebrate by going to services
and gathering for large
meals on the twenty-fifth _^
of December. _^
One of the major H
facets of Christmas is _^M
the Christmas tree. _^^^H

On campus, a
candlelight Christmas
service will take place
on Monday at 9 p.m.
in the Chapel. The
College and Chapel
Choirs will also be
performing on Satur
day and Sunday at 8
p.m., in the Chapel.
The campus can also
gather together on
Tuesday for the all
campus Christmas

party. Hanukkah, a celebration
of the father of Judaism, cel

ebrated every year on the
twenty-fifth day of the Hebrew
month of Kislev. It is an eight
day celebration with one candle
lit each night on the menorah,
or hanukkiyah.

The celebration of Ha
nukkah also includes the ex
changing of gifts, as well as the
giving to those who are less for
tunate. The celebration also
includes a well-known Hanuk¬

kah game of chance called
Dreidle. The Dreidle is played
with a four-sided top, each side
marked with a Hebrew
character that ends up k
spelling the sentence (9
meaning, "A great miracle P~

Although each holiday is
specifically designed for a cer

have one key element: they
bring people together. Said
best when sophomore Rodwin

"a time for people to reflect on

It's a story you probably
don't want to hear, but I'm go
ing to tell you anyway because
you need to hear it. I know, I
know, you're already covered in
it, buried by a deluge of facts,
figures, and bleeding-heart mes
sages all designed to make you
put on a condom, put a con
dom on him, throw out your
needles, and ultimately de
nounce sex. I'm not here to do
any of that.
I'm here to talk about re
alities, to let forth a stream of
consciousness that will either
hit you or not, I don't care
which.
I want to talk about the
constant taste of vomit I've got
in my mouth because my pills
make me sick, and about the
constant nausea I carry with me
right next to the thought, "I am
dying." I want to talk about the

fact that she didn't look sick,
didn't say she was sick, told me
she loved me, then gave it to me
(or me to it?) anyway.
Oh, you don't want to
hear about that, either? How
about the fact that my hope
rises and falls with my T-cells,
and that to me, vitamin C is no
longer "nature's candy" but an
unreliable lifesaver? Avoid cer
tain death by avoiding the com
mon cold.
Every week I have to take
a stool sample to my doctor and
try and ignore the fact that
people are staring at my thin
ning hair and my lesions.
Sometimes, I can't even hold it
when I have to go to the bath
room. Are you still going to tell
me that putting a piece of rub
ber on your penis (his penis,
whoever's penis) is embarrass
ing? It ruins the mood? So will
your funeral, because sex with
a dead body isn't much fun.

If I asked you right now
if you were like me, how sure
would your answer be? Are you
safe? Are you healthy? Are you
dying? Let's face it, any of us
who's fooled around, who's
"done it" with any opening,
who's tasted the "forbidden
fruit" (among other things) is
healthy purely by chance. How
sure are you?
I was sure, but when I
scratched off my lottery ticket,
it said I had it, I won. I played
Russian roulette with my geni
tals and I caught the bullet. All
things considered, I'd rather
have had the consolation prize.
Now I get consolation. Have
you joined my winner's circle?
How sure are you?

In October, I went on a
service learning project to New
York City. I spent some time
laughing, some time shopping
and a wonderful evening at a
Broadway show.
I also spent a great deal

of time with people who don't
do much of any of the above. I
prepared food for an organiza
tion that exists solely to deliver
meals to AIDS patients who can
no longer leave their house,
except for their obligatory
doctor's visits.
I saw what it's like to be
completely dependant on oth
ers. I understood what it's like
to be panic-stricken over ruin
ing a bowl of lettuce by sneez
ing openly in its vicinity (all
food prepared for the clients
must be kept completely germ
free). I learned what it feels like
to brighten an eight year old's
day (who, incidentally, knows
that he's dying) by giving him
an extra helping of dessert.
I have seen the faces of
the dying patients, and no mat
ter how beautiful I have come
to view them as, they are still
tragic. It is in their honor that
I write this, but they are still
dying. Are you? How sure are

you? These days, to say that
someone is "positive" is not to
describe his or her outlook on
life. Positive certainly doesn't
describe the death that the per
son is facing.
Get tested, be safe. Live
life freely, have sex cautiously,
play carefully. And if you know
someone who's got AIDS or
HIV, hug them—hard. Think
of it as giving them an extra
dessert.
The Pa. State Health Cen
ter, located on E. Middle St.,
will continue their practice of
offering, by appointment, free
tests for those concerned about
exposure to the AIDS virus.
Information is available by con
tacting the State Health Center
at 334-2112.

A table will be in the CUB
during lunch today and tomor
row to distribute information
and tor people to write letters
of advocacy and understanding.

Plugging for studying
abroad

by Mark Berg
England Correspondent

THE FOLLOWING IS A
COMMERCIAL ANNOUN
CEMENT:
I was back in Gettysburg
briefly (the fares are low in
November, and my wife had
papers to grade and research to
do) and noticed, on the bulle
tin board, an announcement of
a meeting on December 5 to
explain the College's program
in London and the University
of Essex next Fall.
Since none of the current
students can attend, I thought
that if you are interested in the
program, I'd give you my per
ception of the program and
how the students have benefit
ted. When I attended a simi
lar meeting, I — and I think
some of the other attendees —
came away thinking the previ
ous students had been on one
long vacation. To some extent,
that's true.

A lot of this year's stu
dents have been to Scotland,
Ireland, Holland, Belgium,
France, Germany, all around
England, and elsewhere, singly
or in groups. Clearly, one of the
benefits of being in Britain is
its proximity to the Continent;
and being students, the cost of
travel is about as low as it can
be. There was also much talk
about student life at the Uni
versity of Essex: the drinking
age in Britain is 18, there don't
seem to be as many quizzes and
tests in the classes; and because
they're there for only half a
school year and most courses
are a year long, the professors
were lenient in grading the
Gettysburg students.

That, at first, is definitely
true, but I don't believe the
Gettysburg students in Essex
now feel like they're coasting.
Of course, you can travel to
Europe without being in the
program; I've been told that
some students under 21 at
Gettysburg have been known
to drink beer; and not having
as much school work to do
without worrying about your

grade (if in fact true) may ap
peal to a few students.
But what I have observed
in the students, the change I
have seen in them since we ar
rived, is, well, I guess it could
be called sophistication as de
fined in the dictionary: sophis
ticated character, ideas, tastes,
or ways as the result of educa
tion, worldly experience, etc.
That education, that worldly
experience, is not due to just
traveling in foreign countries,
but day-to-day living and learn¬

ing in another culture, having
formal and informal contacts
with other than waiters or tour
guides.
It's as simple as recogniz
ing that the British don't drive
on the wrong side of the road,
they drive on the other side.
Or, in the case one of the
Gettysburg students, having a
great meal prepared by and in
the company of the visiting
parents of a Greek flatmate. Or
another with a French flatmate
who likes to cook.

What's not as obvious,
and perhaps unexpected, is
that they are learning in their
classes how the rest of the
world views America, and how
its history and actions are in
terpreted by others.
From their classmates and
flatmates, they gained an un
derstanding how others view
their history, and how our
knowledge of other societies
and cultures may are not be
accurate. Given especially the
make-up of the student body of
the University of Essex, drawn
from more than 110 countries,
multi-culturalism is far from
being an abstract idea; here it's
around you all day, every day.
Gettysburg students, meet the
world, so to speak.

So, not matter what you
may hear at the meeting, if you
are open to being "altered by
education, experience, etc., so
as to be worldly-wise; not na
ive," - and have a great time
while doing it - this is the pro
gram for you.
Just remember, there may
not be a Gettysburg teacher's
husband to bring back boxes of
Kraft Macaroni & Cheese.

Reel Hits & Misses
Resurrected Alien a clone

by Jon Froehlich
Staff Writer
"You can't stop it; it's in
evitable" - Ellen Ripley
Though Ellen Ripley,
played, yet again, by Sigourney
Weaver (Alien 7-7/7, Dave) was
referring to the alien force that

she knew would
eventually kill ev
eryone on board
her ship, her state
ment is also ideal
for describing the
movie Alien IV -
Resurrection.
After parts
one through three
of Alien were so
successful at the
box offices, it
should come as no
surprise that a
fourth movie was
made. The discus
sion of this movie
is one of the sim
plest in a long

. are
no deep characters, no com
plex story line and no gut
wrenching emotion. There is
just four times the chases, four
times the flesh ripping, drool
covered aliens and four times
the big guns.
Basically, what it all
comes down to is whether or
not you enjoyed Alien I through
III. If you liked those, you'll,
most likely, not be let down by

Alien TV - Resurrection.
With this being director
Jean Pierre Jeunet's first major
American movie, he had to get
creative to make it work. He
saw what needed to be done
and did it.
In order to get this movie
off the ground, two things

needed to happen - the aliens
had to come back and so did
Ripley. Considering that both
Alien and Ripley met their de
mise in a pit of flaming lava at
the end of Alien III, this task
was not an easy one.
Jeunet continues the
Alien saga two hundred years
later through the use of a shady
military experiment. The op¬

eration, ol course, goes horri
bly wrong, and the action
comes in when Ripley is forced
to stand up and face her old
enemy again.
Though the cloning of
Ripley and of the aliens may
sound incredibly contrived,
and even a bit desperate, we
can let that go because of

what kind of a movie we're
dealing with. Jeunet does,
however, earn a little
more credit for his cre
ative input of a slight
maternal connection
/j\V between Ripley
jnil and the main

A Thanksgiving in the Pilgrim's homeland

by Mark Berg
England Correspondent

sels sprouts, parsnips, and, of
course, cranberry sauce.
For dessert, we were of
fered a choice of apple pie or
pecan pie (but not like Ameri-

the Brits, with no comparable
Thanksgiving, knew when to
start their holiday shopping.
The answer: November 5, Guy
Fawkes Day. Guy Fawkes Day

ready to start counting the days
until we leave.
It's either that, or the fact
that the days are now so short,
with sunset before 4 p.m., mak
ing it a little gloomy. We cer
tainly cannot complain about
the weather; it's been below
freezing only a few nights, and
until this morning, we've had
hardly any rain. And, witness
the students in Paris, there are
still some places we plan to
visit. Though we have been
here for a few months, we
haven't gotten to see all of Eu
rope, and our time is running
out. As one student said, "it's
a bittersweet feeling; we have
seen a lot, we have had experi
ences we will never forget, and
most important, we now have
friends here. Still, we're ready
to go home."

Thanksgiving in Britain
was just another day; no big
football games, no family gath
erings, no traditional holiday
greetings from students ("My
ride is leaving early").
But most of us (a few ac
tually preferred to go to Paris
with their art history class)
wanted to be together and cel
ebrate in the spirit of the holi
day. So, 31 Americans (some
from other schools) and 22
Brits (in the American Studies
program) joined for a Thanks
giving dinner.
We met at the Greyhound
Pub in Wivenhoe. After drinks
in the pub, we went to a pri
vate room on the second floor
for the actual feast. The meal
consisted of turkey (white meat
only) with gravy, stuffing (of a
sort), roasted and mashed po
tatoes (they do like their pota
toes here), peas, carrots, brus-

tion has capped

can pecan pie, more like an
apple pie with a layer of
chopped pecans) topped with
either whipped cream or cus
tard. I did note, however, that
some of the American students
(not the Gettysburgians!) and
the Brits used their utensils Eu
ropean style; how unAmerican.
I wondered aloud how

is the anniversary of the day
that Guy Fawkes tried to blow
up the Houses of Parliament.
Though not widely known out
side of England, it's actually
something of a big deal there.
All agreed that it was a
very good meal in excellent
company. But it also seems as
if this celebration has capped
our experience here, and we're

This is the last of the re
ports from Mark Berg in En
gland. The students will be
back in time for our finals.

Fools won't rush to this
movie

by Glen Beck
Staff Writer "You are everything I
knew I always wanted" —
"Whatever you do, don't tell
them I picked you up outside a
restroom." Who ever thought
you would hear those two lines
in the same movie? They can
be heard in director Andy
Tennant_'s 1997 film Fools Rush
In. The film only lasted a short
time in the theater, but if you're
in a sappy, sentimental mood,
I think it is an enjoyable film.

Granted, if you're not
high on life at the time of
watching the movie-you'll find
many a problem with the plot
and the situation itself. Panned
by other reviewers as one of the
forgettable movies of the year,
the film is saved by one thing:
Salma Hayek, who portrays
Isabel Fuentes. She is a breath
of fresh air and gives one of the
most believable performances
I have seen in a long time.
Matthew Perry {Friends) also
stars. He is quite

Chandleresque, which is fine
for this film, but I hope he
learns to play another type of
character. Actually, he provides
the much needed comedy
through the overly long film.
The major problem is the
storyline is rather predictable.
After a chance meeting in Las
Vegas and a night together at
his place, a young American
construction supervisor, Alex
Whitman, leaves Mexican pho
tographer Isabel Fuentes preg
nant. She finds him a few
months later to let him know
what happened. In the rush of
the moment, he follows her and
they decide to get married. Af
ter that, a clash of customs and
ideas develops in their families
and in their relationship be
cause of their different cultural
and national backgrounds.

Now, I don t know if you
believe me or not, but I did
watch the movie twice in two
different mind sets and believe
me, if you're in a good mood
you will enjoy it. Otherwise,
stay away.

Condoms Lessons from abroad

don't cover it

by Jay Spiese
Contributing Writer
On this past Monday we
all received little red ribbons in
honor of AIDS awareness
week. Included with this was
an envelope containing
condoms. On the way back to
my house, I thought about
what this was saying to people
on campus.
I see students walking
across campus wearing these
little ribbons. They take pride
in wearing them. It shows they
are socially concerned. Besides
it's fashionable. There is some
thing false in these ribbon cam
paigns. We wear them because

we want to raise awareness
about AIDS on our campus. I
tell you that if there is anyone
on this campus who doesn't
know how you get AIDS, then
they have been living in a plas
tic bubble for eighteen years.
Also, I ask you, how does wear
ing a ribbon educate, let alone
prevent the transmission of
HIV? It doesn't. It is just an
other example of a culture
where symbolism is valued over
action. Besides, both you and
I know that the same people
wearing these ribbons all week
have no problems sleeping with
the first person to walk by at a
party.

As for the more difficult
question of condoms. The
Health Center has them avail
able to students free of charge.
It takes at most ten minutes to
go in, pick one up, and head
back to your dorm. Instead
someone decided that this was
not enough. Condoms must be
distributed through the campus
mail. There is nothing naive or
Puritan in my views. I know
that there is a segment on cam
pus that will have sex no mat¬

ter what. Neither do I have a
problem with consenting adults
doing whatever they want.
But, in addressing this I am
going to break one of Gettys
burg College's taboos. Where
in all of AIDS week does absti
nence come in to the discus
sion? There is a significant
number, though not majority,
of students who have chosen to
abstain from sex until marriage.
Let us face it, this is not an en
vironment that supports that
decision.
In our freshmen year, the
Health Center comes around to
the dorms and gives a program
on contraceptives. If they men
tion abstinence at all it is only
in passing. These profession
als treat it as an abnormality or
a joke.

Socially these brave indi
viduals who abstain are pres
sured by their friends. Sex on
this campus is often a way to
social acceptability. We all
know women who start sleep
ing with men to become popu
lar. I know a woman who pa
thetically enough, slept with a
man anytime he wanted to just
so she could say she had a boy
friend. She knew he used her
only for her body. Sometimes
she would be in tears because
of something he said or did.

But come the weekend she
would put out just to have
someone she could say loved
her. Even when he slept with
another woman she didn't
change.
Perhaps I am alone on this
issue. I don't know and I don't
care. Someone needs to say that
abstinence is a legitimate and
honorable choice. Since no one
else will say it this week, this is
for everyone who believes in
abstinence: You made a great
choice.

Student finds questions and answers in Japan

To the Gettysburgian: I
appreciate the copies of the
burgtan sent to me by the Study
Abroad office. I know there are
a number of fellow students
studying all over the world that
appreciate it too. I wanted to
write to you in the hopes of
relaying one of my invaluable
experiences while studying
abroad in Japan. Gettysburg
College offers wonderful op
portunities to spend some time
away from Gettysburg, and I
hope incoming students can
benefit from those that have
already "been there, done it."
It is hard for me to be
lieve that my stay in Japan is
almost over. I came halfway
across the globe hoping to find
some answers to the numerous
questions I had about Japanese
people, their culture, and their
history. I wanted to dispel
myths-draw my own clear im
age about what it is to be Japa
nese. Naive, I know, but the
effort was made.

I looked for it by open
ing an old book to a page long
forgotten. A four-leaf clover,
memento of some exuberant
afternoon in the grass, falls to
the floor and reminds me that
life is both long and short, that
love fades and luck changes.
Somewhere south of Nara, in
a farfetched corner of the
Yamato Plain, is a little six
teenth-century temple town.
Imai-cho, once a rich and pow
erful city surrounded by over a
mile of moat and a 12 ft.-high
wall, is now a quiet backwater
town with a maze of streets too
narrow and people too careful
to accommodate much twenti
eth century nonsense. That this
wooden, tile-roofed town has
stood nearly intact for over 400
years makes it a historical phe
nomenon rarely found in all of

Japan, and one of the Kansai
district's best kept secrets.
The history of Imai-cho
goes back even further. When
the emperor Kammu moved his
court from Nara to Kyoto in
the eighth century,'he refused
to allow the ambitious temple
priests of Nara to accompany
him. As compensation, he
awarded large tracts of land to
these priests, one of which was
in the Yagi area in the center of
the Yamato Plain. The Yagi
tract was strategically located
at the crossroads of two major
highways and was from the
start a village of wealthy land
owners. The powerful
Kofukuji Temple in Nara
wasted no time in imposing a
stifling tax on their smaller
neighbor. A rebellion took
place in 1532 which left the
village in ashes.
Ever since Imai-cho

gained recognition 20 years ago
as an important historic town,
the people of Imai have taken
the future of their formerly
obscure habitat as a matter of
life-and-death importance.
With streets too narrow for cars
(much less buses), they decided
to build parking lots and an
information hall outside the
borders of the town itself. Dis
inclined, however, to have their
town turned into another tour
ist attraction, the people of
Imai require that people seri
ously interested in seeing their
homes apply by telephone will
in advance. This decision has
kept Imai-cho from suffering
the ravages of the mass-tourist
industry that has plagued cit
ies like Kyoto for so long.

Although changes and
additions have been made to
some of the houses that are in
compatible with the traditional
style of the town, many of the

new buildings reflect an in
creasing awareness among lo
cal residents of the significance
of its historical atmosphere. As
long as the people of Imai-cho
continue to value the classic
beauty of the view that awaits
them just outside the doorstep
each morning, this town will
remain a very special place.
Imai-cho is just one of
many places that I have visited
in Japan, but the one that has
had the most profound effect
me. Many Japanese, as do
many Americans, spent their
lives with mysteries. We are
embedded in, and look out on,
a universe that is as mysterious
as it is vast, and if that weren't
mystery enough, we have our
own personal mysteries: Who
am I? Where am I? Why am I?

Our reaction to the mys
teries has been twofold: we cre
ate religions, all of which say
in one way or another, "There
is something bigger than I;"
and, in our quest to find our
selves, we establish and support
programs and institutions such
as Study Abroad and Gettys
burg College, where a new gen
eration is taught what we al
ready know, and equipped with
the tools and inspirations to
continue the grand quest. For
many of us, Gettysburg College
is the place where we begin the
grand quest. To my surprise, I
will leave Japan with even more
questions than I had before I
came. Come see for yourself,
bring a friend. The Study
Abroad office is located in the
College Union building, second
floor. I.E. Fletcher

Consider THIS!

Conflict and Consensus

I can't help it if people
are stupid. My job is sim
ply to inform the campus
community of the actions of
their peers. And I must say
that I have had an excellent
time doing just that.
I have served as Edi
tor-in-Chief of this fine stu
dent newspaper for three
semesters, and adventures
have abounded.
The first issue that I
was in charge of was printed
out of my apartment in
Apple. We had been
flooded out of our office in
Plank Gym and had to move
most of our equipment to
my dining room. That
should have been my first
clue about what I was get
ting myself into.

Less than two months
later, the Gettysburgian was
the first newspaper in the
country to cover the death
of the Brian Peterson baby.
On a hunch, we contacted
the Review at the University
of Delaware and unknow
ingly stumbled upon one of
the biggest news stories of

1996. Through out the year,
the 'Burgian battled college
policies in our Opinions

pages; covered everything
from outsourcing to squirrel
attacks in the news; brought
you the best in Bullets sports
coverage; and entertained with
numerous interesting features.
We changed our style of
layout, increased our coverage,
our subscriptions and our ad
vertising—all while celebrating
our 100th anniversary. We
learned a great deal-and had
even more fun—at national
conferences. We were recently
awarded tops honors in the
world of student journalism
we are finalists for the presti
gious Pacemaker Award.
But enough memories.
As Editor, I have often had to
hide my true opinions in the
interest of the newspaper. The
truth is, the Gettysburgian is
one of the best college news
papers in the country, and any
one who thinks differently is
an ignoramus. We strive for
fairness and have never, never
knowingly gotten a story

wrong.
I am proud to be an
American where the press is
free. Without a scrutinizing,
analytical media, democracy
cannot exist. The first amend
ment is arguably the most im
portant part of our great Con¬

stitution. The fourth estate is
an unofficial check on the bal
ance of all power in this nation
and on this campus.
I am not sorry for any
thing that I have done over the
past year and a half. Sure there
are some things I would change
if I had it all to do over again.
Over all, I am proud of the
Gettysburgian, its history, and
most of all its people. It is com
monly believed that reporters
constitute their own kind of fra
ternity, forming close bonds of
friendship between those who
cherish truth and cynicism. The
reporters, editors, visitors and
staff of the Gettysburgian are
some of the best people I have
met on campus. The love and
respect that I have for these
people can not be measured.
Despite the numerous times
that they have been fired, they
all continue to give every effort
possible-an admirable trait that
weekly inspires me.

I will miss the Gettysburg
ian, but I know that it is time
for someone new to take the
reigns, continue to improve the
paper and make her own mark
on the newspaper and the col
lege. Rebecca K. Babbitt

Consider this...

In the spirit of the up

_Gettysburgian would like to
>resent its Christmas list for
:veryone_'s consideration.
1) Dental dams. Why is
t that AIDS is the disease which
iffects everyone, and does not
liscriminate, yet, through the
h'
stribution of condoms only,
ve discriminate against a por
ion of the population which
:annot possibly use them? It
eveals an underlying ho
nophobia on this campus.
2) Less apathy. Thiscam

ind not enough people of ac
ion. Do more than whine,
how some pride in your col
ege and yourself.
3) An effective and re
ponsive administration.
_fhink before you act. Stop hir
ng consultants. Stop out
ourcing our problems. Listen
o the students, it's our college.
4) Reporters, Photogra

vork very hard, and we know
here are many others who
lave the talent to be here_,
'lease join us in the production
)f your newspaper.

5) Communication. We
11 can communicate we just
on't seem to do it very well_,
ake a little time and let some¬

one, hell, everyone what you
are thinking! For example, the
recent proposed changes in the
sexual assault policy are cen
tered around communication.
Perhaps if we all communicated
better in the first place, such a
policy wouldn't even be neces
sary. 6) We want our goat
back. 7) Lower tuition. We re
alize this would take a miracle
on North Washington Street,
but it's Christmas so we might
as well ask, you never know.
8) A tenure process that
makes sense to the students and
the faculty. Enough said.
9) A rematch in the chair

races. 10) Maturity. There is
more to social life than drink
ing and fraternity parties, and
there are so many people you
haven't met yet.
11) Safe and Happy Holi
days for the entire campus
community. And as a special
note, to all the support staff on
this campus, those who clean
up after us, feed us, and help
the college to function every
day, and so often go unrecog
nized, you are appreciated.
12) And a partridge in a
pear tree.

Conflict and Consensus —
The Pachyderm's Pulpit

In 1988 DanQuaylewas
elected Vice President of the
United States. This should have
been a moment of triumph for
the 41 one year old Vice Presi
dent-elect, however disap
pointment must have befallen
Mr. Quayle. His selection as
then Vice President George
Bush's running-mate was hit
with criticism, his campaign
was a severe disappointment
and in the sole Vice Presiden
tial Debate, the Democratic
Vice Presidential Nominee,
Senator Lloyd Bentson won the
debate with a single line
pointed towards Dan Quayle,
"You are no Jack Kennedy." This
was only the beginning for the
nations 43rd Vice President as
the media was relentless in pub
licly shredding him, he became
the biggest target for comedi
ans looking for a laugh and
gaffe after eaffe befell him.

Oh Danny boy
by John Dunlap
Staff Writer

Four years later President
Bush and Vice President
Quayle were gone the Demo¬

cratic Ticket of then Governor
Bill Clinton and Senator Al
Gore came out on top, but the
outgoing Vice President must
have been happy, happy that he
had begun to repair his reputa
tion. Unlike 1988 when he was
not focused, in 1992 Vice Presi
dent Quayle ran a great cam
paign, one of the few bright
spots in the lackluster Bush
campaign. Unlike 1988 when
Senator Bentson got the best of
him, in 92 the Vice President
went after his opponent Sena
tor Gore and came off well.

With his attack of television
character, "Murphy Brown" for
glamorizing illegitimacy Dan
Quayle started a national de
bate that continues to this day.
His attack of the CBS television
program was mocked and
made fun of at first but by 1994
even President Clinton admit
ted along with most of the lib
eral media that had trashed
Quayle that yes, "Dan Quayle
was right."
His attack of illegitimacy
and his calls for a renewal of
family values won him strong

support among conservative
Republicans. His support of
life and issues that are impor
tant to the family have made
him a favorite among Christian
Conservatives. Today Dan
Quayle is a favorite campaigner
for Republicans running for
public office. The former Vice
President has been on the
stump campaigning with mod
erate Republican Governor
Christine Todd Whitman of
New Jersey to freshman after
freshman in the historic Repub
lican Congressional Class of
1994. He has written two
books and is putting together
a national organization. All
signs are pointing to a run for
the White House himself.
The allegations that Dan
Quayle is not intelligent are stu
pid comments themselves. He
is a great politician who was
able to win a U.S. House Seat

at the age of 29 and four years
after that in 1980, he defeated
longtime Indiana Senator Birch
Bayh, for Senator Bayh's Sen
ate seat. As Vice President his
work with the Competitiveness

Council was viewed positively.
There he fought big govern
ment and the regulations that
punish business. On the Space
Council he was given credit for
helping to restrengthen and
reenergize NASA and his calls
for tort reform and being
headed by the Republican Con
gress. Finally, unlike most poli
ticians, including the current
incumbent President, Dan
Quayle speaks his mind, and
when he does he says what
means and means what he says.
Dan Quayle is a politician
of conviction. In his first race
for Congress two issues that he
campaigned on were term-lim
its and the flat tax, both, espe
cially the latter will big issues
in 2000. Along with his wife,
Marilyn who is his strongest
advisor, and is pretty outspo
ken herself, the Quayles have
been in two national cam¬

paigns, they know what their
like and if they decide to give
2000 a try then Dan Quayle
should go beyond the expecta
tions that the media and the
political pundits will set for

him. If Dan Quayle wants to
remain in politics than he has
to run for President the next go
around. You can stay out of the
political game to long or else
you will be forgotten and the
Quayles know that but they
will strong competition. Some
of the former Vice Presidents
possible competitors include
the 1996 GOP Vice Presiden
tial Nominee, Jack Kemp, the
wife of the man on the top of
the 1996 Republican Ticket,
the President of the American
Red Cross, Elizabeth Dole, and
the son of the man who chose
him to be in the national spot
light and supported him while
he was there, Texas Governor
George W Bush. Beyond those
facing his numerous Republi
can opponents looms Vice
President Al Gore, the Demo
cratic front-runner, and I am
sure that Dan Quayle would
love to get a little revenge for

1992

To the Editor:

Some of our . favorite
things to complain about here
at Gettysburg are the apathetic
students, the uncooperative
administration, and the un
friendly community. AIDS
Awareness Week 1997 has
proven all of us who com
plained wonderfully wrong.
The following community part
ners, administrative and aca
demic departments and student
organizations gave their money,
time, support, and hard work
to make this week of AIDS
Awareness one of the "biggest

things to happen on campus in
a long time," in the words of
one administrator. Those
sponsors include:
The Center for Public
Service, The Office of College
Life, the Chaplain's Office and
the Chapel Council, the Get
tysburg Hospital, the Health
Center, Adams County AIDS
Community Resource Pro
gram, Allies, Student Senate,
Alumni Relations Office, the
Susquehanna Valley Names
Project, the Office of the Dean
of the College, the Office of the

President, Rotoract, ACTUP,
Adams County Family Plan
ning, Alpha Phi Omega, Greek
Organizations, CHEERS, the
Religion Department, the Phi
losophy Department, Global
Studies, Latin American Stud
ies, African-American Studies,
Women's Studies, the Women's
Center, the Biology Depart
ment, Residential College,
Residential College, Residential
Life, Office of Student Activi
ties, Greek Life, Counseling
Services, SAC, Bacchus, The

Much thanks to those or
ganizations, and a special thank
you to the following members
of the AIDS Awareness Week
Committee: Pemberton Brown,

Boltz, J oel Streeter, Carrie Yost,

McClelland, Judy Alder, Bill
Gohl, Connie Songer, and Su¬

san Butcher.
This week could not have
happened without the support
and help of every person who
made a contribution or with
out the student, faculty, staff,
and administrative support and
energy which made this week
a great success. Much thanks
to all of you.
Sincerely,

Dr. James P. Fink, Gettysburg
College "The Great Bridge Contro
versy "
Once upon a time long ago, a bridge
collapsed. The date was November
7, 1940, and the bridge was the
Tacoma Narrows Bridge. This
spectacular collapse was captured on
film, and resonance is frequently and
conveniently blamed for the disaster.
But what really happened on that
fateful day? What was the real
culprit? In this talk, we will take a
closer look at the fascinating story of
the Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse
and the ensuing controversy over its
cause. ALL STUDENTS AND

The Gettysburg College
Men's Basketball team has
started out with a sizzling 4-0
record. The team is led by se

and Sophomore Ryan Napp.
Transfers Jon Bowman
and Bill Davidson, a junior and
sophomore, respectively, along
with sophomore Kevin Tonkins

close in the second half Pfiel
caught on fire scoring 13 of his
16. The Bullets played tanta
lizing defense to spark a big run
in the second half. While
Kueka was never in the game
the Bullets executed on offense
making several back-door cuts
that keyed dunks from Pfiel
and Tonkins.
In the Championship
Game the Bullets took on
Concordia College(IlL) The
Bullets were led by excellent
guard play by Bowman and
Napp each scoring 12. While
Kevin Tonkins dominated the
boards both offensively and
defensively with 13. The game
was back and forth but the Bul
lets played strong down the
stretch to clinch the title. Ryan
Napp was the MVP of the tour
nament while Tonkins and Pfiel
won All-Tournament Team
honors.

On Tuesday November
25, the Bullets battled a hard
nosed Messiah team to a 66
57 win. Messiah got on top by
10 early in the game. The tough
Gettysburg defense sparked the
offense as the Bullets fought
back with a series of backdoor
cuts and three point goals. Tied
at the half the Bullets fell be
hind again with 12 minutes left
to play in the game.
Again tough defense and

Bullets took control of the
game and won by 9.
On December 1 the Bul
lets returned from a happy holi
day to travel to York College.
The Bullets won the game be
fore a hostile crowd of 525,70
65. The Bullets offense came
out of the blocks fast with
points from Rothenberger,
Napp, and Tonkins.
York fought back and tied
the Bullets through halftime.
In the second half the Bullets
led by strong defensive efforts
of Napp and Davidson opened
up a lead. Tonkins who led all
Gettysburg Scorers with 20
paved the way on offense.

Davidson's solid play and
rebounding helped the bullets
down the stretch run. In the
closing seconds of the game up
by two, Jon Bowman came up
with a big steal to seal the vic
tory. After 4 games Napp leads
the Bullets averaging 15.8
points per game. Tonkins is
close behind with 12 followed
by Pfiel with 9.5. Davidson is
the leading rebounder with 7.5

per game but Tonkins follows
close behind pulling down 7.3
per game. Napp also leads the
team from the three-point
stripe shooting 41%. Napp
made the Centennial Confer
ence Honor Roll for the week
for his role in the Messiah
game. Through three games
Napp was the eighth leading
scorer in the Conference. Bow
man was second in the Confer

From Gettysburg Sports Release
Saddled with just a 3-3
record six games into the 1997
campaign, the Gettysburg Col
lege men's soccer team went on
a 15-game unbeaten streak that
not only landed the Bullets in
the NCAA Division HI playoffs
but carried them all the way to
the quarterfinals.
The 15-game unbeaten
streak, which included a pair of
ties , was just one of many
school records established dur
ing the season. The Bullets
broke the team record for goals
in a season by scoring 69 times.
The former mark of 62 was set
in 1995.
The 2-0 loss to New Jer
sey, in .the Division II
quarterfinals also brought an
end to the redord setting career
of Greg Stevcic. Stevcic was the
Bullets second-leading scorer in
1997 with 12 goals and 15 as¬

sists. Stevcic will leave Gettys
burg with the following
records: goals in a career (45),

goals in a season (21 in 1995),
assists in a career (33), assists
in a season (15), points in a
career (123) and points in a
season (49 in 1995). Kind of
impressive.
The Bullets' leading
scorer this season was stellar
sophomore forward Chris
Pryor. He supplied Head
Coach Dave Wright's squad
with 17 goals and seven assists.
Pryor's goal total was the sec
ond highest in school history.
In addition, to this feat, he

matched th,e school record for
assists in a game by assisting
three goals in the 5-0 victory
over Washington.
Senior midfielder Brian
Hill and sophomore forward
Jason Vishio each accounted
for seven of the Bullets 69
scores. Hill had seven assists
to go along with his seven
goals, while Vishio was cred
ited with four assists.
The leading scorer
among freshmen was
midfielder Jeremy Shapiro. In
his first season at Gettysburg,

Sophomore goals leader Chris Pryor tries to toss the ball downfield to one of his teammates.

Shapiro tickled the twine with
four goals and also tallied three
assists.
Junior goalie John
Katerba is on the verge of es
tablishing a new school record

for shutouts. He had seven
shutouts in 1997, boosting his
career total to 17. The record
of 18 is held by both Mike
Battagha and Tom Ashworth.
Katerba benefitted from

the best defense around in
three solid starters. Playing all
22 games for the Bullets were
backs senior Matt Kelly, junior
Josh Rubinich, and junior Jim
Green.

The best benefit however

They have this great show

Well, this Christmas I am

The 1997-98 Gettysburg
Bullet wrestling team is a
unique blend of seasoned
veterans and talented
newcomers. Under the
tutelage of new coach Troy
Dell and a rigorous practice
regimen, the grapplers have
acquired a record of 2-3 at
this point in the season.
With a tenth place finish at
the Ithaca tournament as well
This deceiving

Longwood, 37-10, and
Washington & Jefferson, 27
21.
Binnall, Scarpato, Beck,
Clifford, Dell(2), Lobsenz,
and Fischer all had pins on
the day. This accounts for a
bit of revenge for the Bullets
who lost to the Presidents
from Washington & Jefferson
last year.
After this tn-meet the Bullets
headed to Ithaca, New York
for one of the most
competitive tournaments they
will face until Regionals.

record,however, in no way
indicates the aggressiveness
and renewed vitality of the
wrestlers. ,
The starters for the team
include Jamie Binnall (118),
Mike Ben'Ary (126), Marty
Scarpato (134), Brad
McCutcheon (142), Chris
Beck (150), Chris Clifford
(158), Jake Dell (167), James
Lobsenz (177), Rob Craft

(Heavyweight).
In their first week of action,
the Bullets defeated

out of 14 teams with Jake

with third place.
Jake Dell lost in overtime in
the semifinals to Dan Butler
from Ithaca, but he worked
his way back through to
receive his ribbon.
In recent action, the Bullets
lost two matches to Lycoming

(25-23), respectively. This
weekend they head to
Lebanon Valley for the
Petrofes Tournament.

sports highlight. What could be
greater than that? Kicked back
in a lazy boy, with popcorn in
your right hand and an ice cold

Just once, I would like to
be Stuart Scott and say, "John
Woods must have been butter...
cause he is on a roll." That just
sounds great. Or maybe I could
be ESPN's own Dick Vitale_,
and just scream at random into
a microphone, "He's a daiper

dandy baby, he's a high-riser,
he's awesome with a capital A."
I would do that for free.
Just give me a meal, a roof over
my head, and let me go to
town. So not only do they get
to watch all the sports high
lights they want; get to meet
interesting professional ath
letes, and get recognized as na

also get "mad duckets" for do

So, Santa if you are listen

watch, and even the new puppy
dog. All you have to do is write
ESPN and ask them if just for
one day, I could fill in for Rece

That would make all my
Christmas dreams come true.
While other children are
