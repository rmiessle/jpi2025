Staff Reporter Ziggy Marley and
the Melody Makers will be
coming to Gettysburg on
Saturday, April 18. Open
ing for the Melody Mak
ers will be the bands
Guster and Ghetto Youth.
The Student Activi
ties Council (SAC) decided
that Ziggy Marley and the
Melody Makers were the
best choice after reviewing
the student surveys passed
out earlier this year.
Adam Norton and
Jackie Trottier, co chair
persons of the concert
committee, said that there
was a great demand on
campus for reggae music.
The band has re
ceived widespread praise,
and their new alburn,
Fallen Is Babylon, has been
nominated for a Grammy
Award.

"Ziggy Marley and
the Melody Makers aren't
a flash in the pan," sayi
Norton, "they have re
ceived both good record
and concert reviews."
Other bands being
considered for the Spring
Concert included Rusted
Root, Barenaked Ladies,
Third Rye Blind, Match
box 20, and Toad the Wet
Sprocket. After studying
the bands' schedules,
Norton and Trottier made
their hnal decision.
Opening band
Guster pLiys a unique type
of modern folk. They are
known for their outstand¬

ing live performances. The
Melody Makers are bring
ing an additional opening
band, Ghetto Youth with
them. Ziggy Marley and
the Melody Makers strive
to connect the rich reggae
roots with a variety of
today's popular music
styles. The band has sold
millions of records, toured
the globe, and won two
Grammy Awards.
Melody Makers
Sharon, Stephen, Cedella,
and Ziggy Marley are all
children of the late reggae
great, Bob Marley. More
than 20 other musicians
accompany the Marleys to
make up the band.

According to SAC,
the student response to the
Spring Concert has been
"outstanding." Reggae
record sales at K&K
Records have increased,
and Norton and Trottier
have heard nothing but
good things about their
choices.
"Guster has a strong
following," said Trottier,
"and the Melody Makers
fit the upbeat Springfest
theme."
A large turnout is ex
pected for the event. Tick
ets are set to go on sale
Monday, April 6.
"Everybody is look
ing forward to something
different," concluded
Norton, "They're excited
to come, and we're excited
to have them."

examination of the College's
academic and co-curncular
programs when it presents its
findings to the College's Board
of Trustees on Saturday, Febru

Commission members have
provided thoughtful and in
sightful perspectives on areas of
vital importance to the future
of the College, and their rec

Run-off election
to be held
by Henry Fawell
Assistant News Editor
- The Student Senate elec
tions saw several new students
voted into office this week, yet
the most important position,
the Presidency, will have to be
decided in a runoff.
In accordance with the
Student Senate Constitution, a
presidential candidate must
obtain a majority vote from the
students to claim the position.
Yet none of the three candi
dates for the position, Sara
Zalewski, Earl Redding nor
John Dunlap could do so.
The run-off election will
be held between Zalewski and
Redding, most likely sometime
next week.

There were, however,
three new positions decided in
the elections. Emily Robertson
won the Vice Presidency, Liz
Walsh will be the new Secre
tary, and Lisa Wingenroth is
the new Treasurer.

The commirree still has retention.

more than $30,000 left to al
locate to students for social
events. In order to obtain fund
ing for its events, an organiza
tion must complete an applica
tion to be approved by the Stu
dent Life Committee.
In order to be approved
the event or function must
meet four cirtena established
by the committee. The event
must include the entire campus
or very large groups. The idea
must be approached in a fresh
and inovative way. The pro
grams should be sponsored by
unique partnerships between
campus organizations. The
events should be held in new
or different program locations.
Applications for event
proposals are available at the
information desk in the College
Union Building.
The Committee is com
prised of six students, Valerie
Katzmar, Becca O'Connell,
mark Astrom, Jen Gillete,
Rodwin Lowe, and Marcelo
Ardon. Students and organi
zation with questions are en
couraged to contact them.

"The successful
completion of the Commission
on the Future of Gettysburg
College will help the Board of
Trustees develop a clear action
plan for review and eventual
implementation for the benefit
of our current and future stu
dents, especially in relation to
programs, curriculum, and the
fostering of an active and dy
namic learning environment,"
said Gordon A. Haaland, Presi
dent of Gettysburg College.
"We here at Gettysburg express
our sincere thanks to all the
Commission members for their
hard work and to those mem
bers of the campus community
who served as information re
sources to the Commission
members."

The Board of Trustees
will use their next two meet
ings in May and September to
review the Commission's spe
cific recommendations and pri
oritize suggestions based on
strategic planning and budget
considerations.

Features
A sporting good time

by Cara Masucci
Staff Reporter Lately it seems as though
there is an increase in the
amount of time people are put
ting into working out and
maintaining a healthy body.
Nowhere is this more apparent
than here at Gettysburg Col
lege. Students at _k_^_kh

Gettysburg have a
wide variety of op
tions open to them in
order to achieve their
goals. This is thanks
to a large effort on the
part of the Campus
Recreation Depart
ment. There is a wide
variety of different
programs that anyone
on campus can join.
They range from
intramurals and club
sports to aerobics, spe
cial events, and finally
the fitness facilities.
A lot of work
goes into these pro
grams, according to
Director of Campus
Recreation Cynthia
Wright. First off, you
have to secure a facil
ity, advertise the event
and sign-ups, and hire
and train officials and

supervisors.
This is not all. It _^
is essential to work _t
with the Office of Col- -s
lege Life and Student

Basketball Is just one of the many Intramural sports offered by the Campus Recreation Department for all
tudents to play. If you have any questions about the programs, contact Cythia Wright or Barbara Streeter,

Senate,
which currently fund club
sports, in order to get every
thing off the ground.
Consequently, there are
hundreds of workers in Cam
pus Recreation. According to
Wright and her Assistant Direc
tor, Barbara Streeter, campus
recreation has always been one
of the most popular jobs on
campus. The workers do ev
erything from manning the fit
ness facilities to refereeing in
tramural events. According to
Wright, "Our programs would
not exist if not for the students

helping to run it."
Currently there are seven
intramural sports that Wright
oversees (Wright handles all
intramurals, club sports, and
fitness facilities, while Streeter
oversees special events and
aerobics). Flag football and
basketball appear to be the
most popular, drawing on

about 350 participants each.
Rounding out the seven
intramural sports available to
the campus are softball, indoor
and outdoor soccer, volleyball,
and floor hockey. All draw
roughly 200 participants each.
The intramurals are not
the only aspect of recreation
drawing high numbers. The
fitness facilities have seen a
jump to 1000 visitors a week,
not including athletic teams
according to Wright. Streeter
also points out that the aero
bics numbers have grown to
about 225 with this time of

year being the most populated.
Special events draw heavy
participation as well.
One improvement in
numbers that both Streeter and
Wright are happy to see is the
increase in women's participa
tion and co-ed participation in
al I aspects of campus recreation.
Wright stated, "The College is

really trying to make an effort
to have students interact in a
healthy environment."
One of the main goals in
cluded in the mission statement
of Campus Recreation is to fos
ter an environment conducive
to studying. If you can relieve
stress, as many students who
participate say they do, then
you are much more able to
study more efficiently and pro
ductively. The recreation gives
the students a chance to blow
off steam.
It might be e.isy to blow
off steam in recreation because,

as several students comment,
they make new friends and cul
tivate existing relationships.
is also easy to laugh when you
see your professor trying to
drive the lane in a game of bas
ketball!
Again, Wright feels this
emphasizes the goal of putting
everyone on the campus at an t,

equal level.
Intramurals are often run
in a round-robin setup, consist
ing of four to six weeks of play.
Then it advances to a one week
playoff round.
Special events, on the
other hand, are one-day events
that include such activities as
bench press, badminton, tennis
singles, ultimate Frisbee, and
4x4 volleyball.
What is positive about
the student involvement in rec
reation is that many of the stu
dents who participate in one
event are also involved in an-

other. It sustains a cycle of
healthy habits in exercise. All
of the programs are also sub
stance free.
Another unique quality
about participation in Campus
Recreation is that many varsity
sports teams join a different in
tramural team in the off-sea
son, as the women's soccer
team did.

I lo ensure that ev¬
erything is running
smoothly and that the
students are enjoying
themselves, the Depart
ment of Recreation sends
out evaluation forms to
see how programs are
holding up. Most of the
comments given are en
I couraging and reinforce
I the need for such activi¬

ties. The department is
also constantly searching
for suggestions and new
ideas on how to better
serve the students.
If anyone wants to
become part of the Cam
pus Recreation staff or
participate in recreation
on any level they should
contact Wright or
Streeter.
Both women also
pointed out the stress
they put on the fact that
anybody, no matter what
level of experience or tal
ent, can take place in any
of the activities listed.
lr

rurcnermore, a
team sport comes along, but an
individual cannot find a team
to join, they should contact the
department and they can be
entered on an existing team.
Wright can be contacted
at cwright or x6322. Streeter
can be contacted at bstreete at
x6323.
Wright uses a Thomas
Jefferson quote to demonstrate
the importance of campus rec
reation: "Exercise and recre
ation are as necessary as read
ing. I will say rather more nec
essary because health is worth
more than learning,"

Reel Hits & Misses
Sphere not much of a ball

by Dan Larkin and Mike Pctro
Movie columnists
Mike: Okay movie fans,
picture this. You are one of the
leading minds in the country in
your field, either mathematics,
astrophysics, biology, or psy
chology. You are called to in
vestigate a crash of a "space
craft" somewhere in the middle
of the Pacific Ocean, inside of
which you discover a perfect
sphere. Somehow you go in
side of this large orb and after
coming out, all of your dreams
and nightmares come true.
If you can picture this,
you might like the new Michael
Crichton movie Sphere.
Dan: I'm still having a
difficult time picturing that.
But I liked Sphere anyway.
Sphere is directed and produced
by Barry Levinson (Wag the

Dog, Sleeper;,), and while it
isn 't as memorable as some of
his other projects, it does have
its moments. I was fairly ap
prehensive about this movieie
membenng that my last expe
rience with a Michael Crichton
vehicle was The Lost World,
which I'm pietty sure is the
worst movie I have ever seen.
But, have no fear, Sphere is
much better than that dinosaur
flick. I went to see this movie
with admittedly low expecta
tions, and I actually came out
of the theater with it exceed
ing my expectations im
mensely. The movie features
an all-star cast with Dustin
Hoffman (Ishtar, Dick Tracy)
as Dr. Norman Goodman,
Samuel L. Jackson (National
Lampoon's Loaded Weapon,
The Great White Hype) as

Harry Adams, and Sharon
Stone (Action Jackson, Police
Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol)
as Beth Halperin.
Beyond these three stars,
who all turn in unique and in
teresting performances is an
excellent supporting cast. Pe
ter Coyote (E.T. The Extra-Ter
restrial, Outrageous Fortune)
plays Harold Barnes, the token
government spook, and Liev
Schreiber of Scream fame plays
Ted Fielding, the hot shot
physicist. Add in Queen
Latifah (Hoodlum, House
Party 2) and you've got your
self a cast!
The cast does a pretty
good job developing these
characters despite a fairly weak
script. The dialogue seems
forced and artificial through
most of the film. It is to the
credit of the actors (especially

Hoffman and Jackson) that
they are able to carry much of
the film with their personalities.
Jackson and Hoffman
have both bad particularly
good winters at the movies,
each following strong perfor
mances in Jackie Brown and
Wag the Dog, respectively, with
good jobs here. Stone's perfor
mance, however, isn't as strong
as her two co-stars. The special
effects of the movie are quite
good. The underwater scenes
are spectacular, and the various
underwater creatures are all
pretty creepy. The effects are
not overpowering, allowing the
film to tell its story unfettered
(unlike the stupid dinosaur
movie, which was all about the
effects.)
This movie bills itself as
a suspense and it delivers the
goods. There are some genu¬

inely scary moments in this film
that will make you jump out
of your seat. Furthermore, the
story, save for a few plot holes,
is well held together and engag
ing for the viewer.
/ liked the story, but I felt
it was condensed in order to fit
into the two hour movie, and
the conclusion seemed a bit
rushed. Overall, it is an inter
esting, suspenseful film. I give
it two and 3/4 stars (out of five).
I thought this movie was
worth the price of the admis
sion and I am going to give it a
three out of five stars. Not ev
ery movie can be a great movie,
so the cinematic landscape has
to be dotted with movies that
are simply good entertainment.
If you are looking for a few
thrills and a good suspense
movie, then I recommend
Sphere to you.

Hamel Contributing Reporters

successful field hockey career.
Throughout high school I had
worked my way to All-State and
Ail-American titles. But a con
tinued career in the sport came
to a sudden halt when I devel
oped a fierce battle with an eat
ing disorder, a struggle which I
have endured for the past three
years. When most college stu
dents wake up in the morning,
their first thoughts are "What
will I wear?" or "What do I
have due in my first class?" Not
me. My first thoughts are "Will
I eat today? If so, how much or
how little? How many times
will I work out then, if I do
eat?" These are all questions I
struggle to answer, not just
when I wake up, but as I go
through my day, until I go to
sleep. And then, many of my
dreams are about food and ex-

Eating disorders. Many
people choose to believe that
they do not exist at Gettysburg
College. All someone has to do
is open their eyes to see that
there are students who are af
fected by bulimia and/or anor
exia. The fight against eating
disorders is a continuous one.
For those who are struggling to
overcome it, the battle is ex
hausting. Each day, the mere
thought of food overpowers a
person's thoughts and actions,
resulting in an obsession that
just doesn't stop.
The following is a per
sonal experience of a student
who has continuously battled
eating disorders over the past
three years. Hopefully this will
give a better understanding of
what it is like to live with an
eating disorder and help us to
realize that it is a common oc¬

currence in our society.
/ came to Gettysburg with
high hopes of a productive and

erase. Contrary to what many
people believe, eating disorders
are not just about being skinny.
My eating disorder is about my
need for control and perfection.

It is related to my desire to
please everyone. It is a reflec
tion of the guilt and worthless
ness that I feel about myself.
Sometimes, I do not believe that
I am worthy of eating.
Over the past three years
my weight has ranged from 90
pounds to 130 pounds. Finally,
this past fall, my weight reached
the lowest ever and I was forced
to go to an eating disorders hos
pital. My three week stay taught
me a lot about myself, both in
relation to food and self-worth
as a person. Although the hos
pital has helped me tremen
dously and I have now gained
about 25 pounds, every day is
a difficult struggle.
What is important is that
people are aware that eating
disorders are very prevalent,
especially on college campuses
like Gettysburg.

The first step to over
coming this battle is to admit
that you have a problem and to
accept help from those who care
the most for you. In doing this,
half the battle is won.

Alex Rowland, a profes
sor of organic chemistry at
Gettysburg College, is a man
who spends his days working
with his students and doing re
search in the laboratories of the
Chemistry Department. He
has spent his last 40 years in
Gettysburg and is one of the
most senior faculty members in
the Chemistry Department.
Raised in New York,
Rowland is one of seven sib
lings. He spent five years in
high school, which he de
ribed
buiucu

as a:
a great
experi
ence.
"An ex-
tra year

did me a lot of good. I learned
typing, took extra courses and
did a lot of extracurricular ac
tivities," he commented.
He did his undergraduate
studies at Gettysburg College
because his parents wanted him
to study at a Lutheran college.
After graduating from
Gettysburg, he attended Brown
University, where he studied
organic chemistry. Ultimately,
he came back to Gettysburg as
a professor.
As a professor, Rowland
has flourished and is held in
high regard among both his
peers and his students, al
though he has the reputation of
giving difficult pop quizzes. He
was awarded the Distinguished
Teaching Award this year, and
has published articles in many
journals over the years.
Rowland thinks the

Honor Code System was the
best thing to be introduced into
college. He believes that it
makes students more reliable
and fosters a trustworthy rela
tionship between the faculty
and the students.
Over the years, he also
tried to promote a smoke-free
environment in the college.
Even so, he can still be found
smoking on the steps of
Briedenbaugh Hall. The latter
incident expresses the more
human side of Rowland.

In the research field.
Rowland is a prominent figure.
He has been carrying out re
search in both stereochemistry
and fullerenes and is a promi
nent member in that field.
"Because I like it," an
swered Rowland when asked
why he got involved in chem
istry. He has spent three-quar
ters of his life studying chemis
try only because he enjoys it.
"I was good in other subjects,
but chemistry was my favorite.
Curiosity drives me on."
He believes that science is
an important part of one's edu
cation and he was very dis
t u

i r b e d
when a
deci
sion
was
made
_-"
the labs

last year to remove
from some of the science
courses. "How can one do a
science course without con
ducting the practical side of it?"
he wondered.
Besides the resulting lack
of unity among the professors,
he is very satisfied with the
freedom Gettysburg allows its
professors. "Gettysburg never
interfered with my work. It al
lowed me to do research in
whatever interested me.
"I like working with my
students. They make it fun. I
want my students to do their
best and better than I ever did."
Since he is so involved in
his work, Rowland has very
limited outside interests.
"Working is my main pasttime,
but I find the history of World
War II very interesting." He
also sang in a choir during col
lege but quit because of all the
extra work.

At the end of the day,
Rowland likes to go home and
relax, which for him means
"drinking coffee and smoking
a cigar."
"The most important les
son I learned in life is that one
should exert oneself both out
wardly and inwardly." This is
Rowland's motto, and is per
haps what brought Rowland
the success and contentment he
now enjoys.

Man too much for Earth

As one web page put it,
overpopulation is like a big
magnifying glass, it makes little
problems into big ones. Popu
lation size and global warming
are closely related. Also, all the
activities of deforestation, in
cluding clearance for stationary
agriculture, producing fire
wood and charcoal, rotating
cultivation, commercially
driven logging, expanding ur
ban and industrial areas, over
grazing and fodder collection,
are associated with the rapid
growth of population. Energy
consumption also increases
with population, as more
people in developing countries

For 99% of man's history,
there was essentially no popu
lation growth. But now, in the
last 1% of our history (starting
at approximately year 0), hu
man population has exhibited
exponential growth. It took
35,000 years (to 1830) to reach
the first billion people. The
second billion took only 100
years (to 1930) to reach, and
the third, 30 years (by 1960).
The fourth was reached in 15
years (by 1975), and the fifth
only 12 years (by 1987). With
today's rate of growth, our
population will swell from 5.6
billion to about 8.5 billion by
2025. If current predictions of
population growth prove accu
rate and patterns or human ac
tivity on the planet remain
unchanged, science and tech
nology may not be able to pre
vent the irreversible degrada
tion of the environment or
widespread world poverty.

move into cities. Stress is also
put on land as it is pushed to
meet human needs.
The answer to these
problems may be a sound edu
cational program. Family plan
ning and social and economic
incentives may help curb this
population growth.
At any rate, what is done,
or not done, in the next decade
will determine the economic,
social, and political prospects
for much of the world for the
next century.

In Case You Missed It

Original Blues will make you smile

by Eileen O'Donnell
Movie Columnist
With all the hype over
Blues Mothers 2000, I though
that the original, the one that
staited it all, _should be recog
nised. Released in 1980 and
directed by John Landis (who
also diiected the sequel and
made a cameo in ihe movie)
The lilites Burthen stars John
Behibhi (Annual House, 'I'he
Rutlei) and J)jd Aykroyd

(Grosse Point Blank, Dragnet).
The pair, along with their
band, were an extremely popu
lar act on Saturday Night Live
in the seventies. They released
numerous albums, and the
band is made up
entirely of re- |
spected musicians. _^^^H

the Boai d (jf _Education. If this

happens, Curtis will be out on
the street and the Penguin will
be sent to the missions. The
boys can't let that happen to the
only family they ever had.
Curtis encourages them

to"slide on down to the lemple
Rock and catch the Reverend

Monty worth the
show

by Stacy Schmeidel
Contributing Reviewer
Why would anyone
want to see a movie about six
unemployed guys who take
up stripping to make a few
bucks? Well, take it from some
one who's seen The Full
Monty, which was released
last August, not once but
seven times: this is one film
you won't want to miss. Sure,
the plot focuses on a cadre of
average blokes "getting their
kit off." But this is no

Showgirls. It's not even Strip
tease. The Full Monty, di
rected by Peter Cattaneo and
written by Simon Beaufoy, is
a simultaneously poignant, in
sightful, and laugh-'til-you
cry funny look at friendships,
self-esteem, and making the
most of what you've got. Lit
erate and witty, the film also
features one of the most real
istic and richly drawn mar
riages ever portrayed in a
comedy, and some of the most
brilliant physical comedy of
the past year.

Plus, it's got lawn
gnomes. What more could
you ask for?
The man behind the
Monty scheme is Gaz (Robert
Carlyle, virtually unrecogniz
able from the loathsome
Begbie he played in last year's
Trainspotting), who like a lot
of men in Sheffield, England,
is down on his luck after los
ing his job in the bust of
Sheffield's steel industry.
Desperate to'come up
with 700 quid to pay his over
due child support bills, Gaz
notices how the local women
line up when a traveling
Chippendales show comes to
town, and seizes on the no
tion of putting on a local ver
sion of the show in order to
make some quick cash.

Reactions to the scheme
are initially cool ("Who'd
want to see your widgie?")_,
but times in Sheffield are
tough, and almost before Gaz
knows it he's holding audi
tions and putting together a
line-up of dancers.
Over the next few

weeks, through a series of rous
ing rehearsals, soccer games,
and personal crises, the guys
coalesce, both as friends and as
a dancing ensemble; these six
men who initially had nothing
in common are soon sharing
beauty tips and swinging their
hips to Donna Summer tunes.
The problem, as some see
it, is that even after all the re
hearsal time, the ensemble is still
made up of average guys. Gaz
is "too thin," Dave is "too fat,"
Lomper's "pigeon chested," and
while Horse has some good
moves, he's also got gray hair
and a hip that's "a bit dodgy."
Pressed as to why the lo
cal "birds" will turn out to see
this act when they can see "the
real thing" at a Chippendale's
show, Gaz lights upon an idea
that will make his group stand
out. He promises that the
Sheffield men will go "the full
Monty," that is, they'll take their
striptease act all the way, no g
strine required.

As the film winds toward
its inevitable (yet tasteful!) con
clusion, we watch the six main
characters wrestle with the per
sonal insecurities that accom
pany unemployment, divorce,
body image, and intimacy.
Of particular note is Mark
Addy {Frost, in preproduction)
as Gaz' best friend Dave, who's
convinced that his weight is
cooling his wife's love for him
but feels unable to do anything
about it.
The other men in the
group are played by Tom
Wilkinson (The Ghost and the

Darkness), Steve Huison (When
Saturday Comes), Paul Barber
(Priest), and Hugo Speer (Bhaji
on the Beach).
The Full Monty has de
servedly earned Oscar nods for
Best Score, Screenplay, Director,
and Best Picture, and a Golden
Globe nomination for Best Pic
ture, but it's the fully drawn
characters that make the film
worth seeing even more than
once. After spending a couple of
hours with Gaz and the boys,
you'll want to see more of
them—even after they've gone
the full monty!

The Full Monty will be
shown in Bowen Auditorium on
Sunday and Monday at 8 p.m.

Women's history? Duh

by Sara Lindahl
Contributing Reporter

and the month of March has
been designated Women's
History Month to honor
many great women and to cel
ebrate their achievements.
During this month,
Gettysburg College's aca
demic buildings will be deco
rated with colorful posters to
featuring women who have
made outstanding contribu
tions to these academic fields.
The posters were de
signed not just to include trail
blazers who fought against
discrimination to force doors
open for women's higher edu
cation and promotions in the
work place, but also include
women whose efforts have
helped a global community.

Two years ago I overheard
a male to male conversation in
Musselman Library. The boys
were looking at the course cata
logue when one asked the other,
"Why is there a women's stud
ies major, but not a men's stud
ies major?" The response was,
"Duh, what do you think history
is?" The first replied, "Oh yeah,
that's because women haven't
done anything."
It is my hope that at the
end of next month, everyone on
this campus will be able to scoff
at this erroneous statement.
Women have made a sig
nificant contribution to history,

Women's history was
completely neglected in cur
riculums as recently as the
1970's.
In 1978, a California task
force started Women's History
Week, which led to Women's
History Month across the na
tion. In 1987, Congress de
clared March to be Women's
History Month.
Many states now have a
Women's Hall of Fame, and
Women's History Month has
become a focal point of cel
ebration across the nation.
I encourage everyone to
examine the posters and join in
the celebration of women's his
tory throughout the month of
March.

Screenwriter/Novelist to speak
in Junction

Screenwriter and novelist Todd Komarnicki will be reading from his work on Thursday,
February 26th, at 8:00 p.m. in the Junction. The event is sponsored by the Writing House.
Komarnicki's novels include Famine (1997) and Free (1995). Of Famine, Publisher's Weekly
says, "Hints of supernatural forces at work subtly underscore the narrative's theme: the
power of emotional need to create its own reality. A stylistic tour de force."

Library BULLETin

by Libby Musselman
Library Columnist
Q: I'm a big fan of In
terlibrary Loan, but I have a
complaint. If I want two ar
ticles from the same journal,
why can't I write them both
on the same request form?
It saves paper, and then
I don't have to write down my
name and address so many
times-what a pain!
A: We need one request
per card for two reasons. One
is that even though the articles
are from the same journal, the

same may
be filling the request for both
articles.
The second is that we
must comply with copyright
laws. After we've made five
requests in the same year (like
in 1998) tor the current five
years of one journal (like the
Journal of Chemical Educa
tion from 1992 to 1998), then
we (as in Gettysburg College)
must pay a copyright fee for
each subsequent request (af
ter five requests) of that jour
nal (dated from the past five
years).

It is bookkeeping that
drives us crazy and we know
it doesn't make you feel any
better, but we have to com
ply with the law. Capice?
Q: Who decides what
books and videos the library
buys? If a student like me

wants something, who (or is it
whom?) do I tell?
A: Librarians, and the fac
ulty select and purchase materi
als for our collection. Generally
the selections support the cur
riculum.
However, we are happy to
entertain suggestions from stu
dents as well. Please give us your

Conflict and ComEmus-

To the Editor:

In defense of a brotherhood

I am writing in response
to the column "Greek Prob
lems," printed in the Febru
ary 19, 1998 edition of The
Gettysburgian. I will refrain
from making scathing re
marks as I understand this
point of view. 1 will, however,
proceed to show that harsh
generalizations about Greek
life are, at least in one case,
sorely mistaken.
I must start by giving
some background so that one
can better understand where
my point of view is coming

from. Upon coming to Get
tysburg, I too was skeptical
about the values of Greek life.
I came over to Crow often
simply to visit my older
brother and many of his
friends whom I have known
for a number of years. At a
certain point in the second
semester of my freshman year,
I made the decision that I
would join Alpha Chi Rho,
and that has probably been
the most important decision
that I have made in my col
lege career.

The article points to the
shortcomings of fraternities
citing that fraternities are es
sentially nothing more than
drinking clubs. It further goes
on to cover its bases in decry
ing the most basic response
that "we do more than just
party," saying that one or two
philanthropic events a year
and participation in events
organized by other groups
does not really add toward to
good of the community or
campus. I am in complete
agreement on those grounds.
I would simply like to bring
to point out that the standard
view of fraternities, at least in
one case, is very far off base.
Yes, we at Alpha Chi
Rho do party. I won't try to
justify that in saying that we
are providing some great so
cial outlet for the campus, or
any other b.s. line commonly
recited. In regards to parties,
I will simply say that in most
u
_£,
a_;
I
tc
vi _oi
al
c j
a i
r_{
I

cases, they are simply a lot of
fun. I would like to turn the
attention, to the fact that we at
Alpha Chi Rho do, in fact,
more than just party. Since I
have been a brother in this fra
ternity I have seer, the most
dynamic and upward moving
organization I have ever been
a part of. Certainly, we have
our routine philanthropy
events each year, with our char
lty volleyball tournament
(which last spring raised almost
$1500 for a one day event) be
ing the most prominent. We

participate from time to time
in those events organized by
others; helping with toy drives,
spending time with underprivi
leged children and many other
worthwhile ventures. These,
however, are few and far be
tween. What I would most like
to draw attention to is the fact
that this fraternity organizes
and runs one of the biggest
ongoing philanthropy projects
on campus. Every Saturday
(and recently we have begun
going on Friday afternoons as
well) my Brothers and I travel
the 50-or-so miles to

Sandtown, a community in in
ner city Baltimore. Every week,
we spend numerous hours
working on the renovation of
a row house located at 1506
Mount Street, working in con
junction with Habitat for Hu
manity. This is not simply a
chapter project, either. Al
though still struggling some,
our initiative has started a na
tionwide project for all broth
ers of Alpha Chi Rho, combin
ing fundraising efforts with in
dividual participation in order
to help rebuild this once-thnv
mg community. In addition to
just working, we have at
tempted to join ourselves into
the community, making friends
with local youths (especially a
young boy named Marcus) and
spending almost as much time
with them as with our work on
the physical structure of the
house. The generalization
about fraternities being noth¬

ing more than a negative influ
ence and a drinking club are
not at all true. (We often find
ourselves having a much better
time in Sandtown than we do
at a party.)
Now I would like to ad
dress the generalization that
"Greek society is not composed
of individuals as much as herds"
and that "people who used to
think on their own now resign
themselves to accepting the
views of the group." My re
sponse to these statements is
simply that in the experiences
I have had, this couldn't be fur
ther from the truth. Some of
my best friends in the entire
world are here at AXP, and
these are the people that are
polar opposites to my view
point. We never agree on any¬

thing, debate and argue con
stantly, and I love them dearly
for it. On more than one oc
casion, I've found myself
locked in struggles over the
existence of God or the nu
ances of Buddhism, as well as
discussions of every topic from
chemistry to rush. Through it
all, rather than conforming to
any particular viewpoint, I've
found myself strengthened in
my own convictions, and have
been encouraged to do so. Be
ing a member of Alpha Chi Rho
has allowed me to pursue a per
sonal passion for philanthropic
endeavors and shown me the
value of many points of view
that I had previously dismissed,
while all the while allowing me
to cling to my own individual
views and beliefs.

I hope that these ex
amples have opened eyes to the
fact that, whether we here at
AXP are an exception or not,
generalizations about Greek
life do not always hold true.
Thank you very much for tak

Consider this

On Monday, Tuesday ,
and Wednesday of this week,
students were presented with
the opportunity to help deter
mine the future of student life
on this campus.
Elections for the Student
Senate executive board were
held in the CUB from 11 to 1.
But due to the fact that none of
the three candidates received
more than fifty percent of the
votes, a special election will be
held next week to determine
the office of Student Senate
President.
In the past three days,
only about 400 out of over
2,000 eligible student voters
turned out to support their
choices for the leadership posi
tions. That means only one
fifth of the student population
opted to participate in the se
lection of these powerful.
Who really cares about
apathy anyway? How does
apathy affect me? Does apathy
even matter? Perhaps the issue
of student apathy has been
beaten to death.
Some students might
question the effectiveness of
our student government. This,
however, should not be a rea
son not to vote, but rather, the
primary reason to cast a ballot.
The run-off election held
for the presidency should be
looked upon as a second chance
for the campus, a chance to

show that we care about the fu
ture of social and academic life
at this college.
Students constantly
whine for more social events,
for non-Greek activities, and
for more culture. Well, what
does the Senate do? Does any
body care? By the voter turn
out, guess not.
The elections were widely
advertised. The everyone di
gest has been flooded with
"vote for me" messages for sev
eral days now; bulletin boards,
walls, and doors around cam
pus are flapping with signs.
Could it have been the glut of
political advertisements actu
ally discouraged students from
voting? Was it due to the fact
that people don't happen to be
in the CUB between the hours
of Hand 1?
These are all possible ex
planations for the lack of stu
dent support for the election,
but they are not excuses. Does
this imply that over 1600 of the
students on this campus could
not find time in their days to
go to the CUB and circle four
names on a piece of paper?
How many of these non-voters
can be heard complaining about
something on this campus?
Perhaps it is time for ac
tion. Perhaps if they ignore
them, the problems will go
away. Yeah....and perhaps tu
ition will go down next year.

Conflict and Coh$eh$us
To the Editor: TotheEditor:

Sisters unite
"Our strength is in know
ing that each one of us could
stand alone, but we choose to
stand together."
On behalf of the Greek
women at Gettysburg, we
wanted to write a letter ex
pressing the benefits of soror
ity life. We are proud of our
affiliation and more than will
ing to tell everyone why we feel
this way.
Not only are sorority
women leaders in our GreeK
organizations, but we hold
many executive offices
throughout other organizations
as well. We are all active par¬

ticipants in shaping the lives of
students at Gettysburg College.
In addition to that, we support
many campus functions both in
numbers and with monetary
contributions. As a community
of Greek women, we agreed
not to sponsor any events that
conflicted with the Snowball
and encouraged our members
to attend. The Panhellenic
Council (which is the unifying
and governing body of all five
sororities on campus) gave
$500 to help support the all
campus event. The 400 plus
women that are part of the
Greek system bring a tremen
dous amount to Gettysburg.

Sororities are social orga
nizations, but we are also much
more. Academic success is held
at a high value. Women can
not rush if they have below a
2.2 GPA. Many organizations
have even higher standards
once you become a sister. Phi
lanthropy is also a valued en
tity. Whether the event is An
chor Splash (Delta Gamma),
Turkey Trot (Chi Omega), a
Softball Tournament (Gamma
Phi Beta), a Dance-a-thon (Al
pha Delta Pi), or a Pancake
Breakfast (Alpha Xi Delta),
women of ALL organizations
work together to raise con
sciousness and financial sup
port for those less fortunate
than we are here at Gettysburg.
We are, however, differ¬

ent from other campus organi
zations. What makes us unique
is our ritual. Every Tuesday
night, we reaffirm the fraternal
values that we were all founded
on. They are the basis and
guidelines for every meeting.
Every sorority and even the
Panheilenic Council has an
open creed that states each
group's purpose and values.
Some creeds are repeated as
part of ritual, while others are
recognized in different ways.
The sorority pins we all wear

each Tuesday are a symbol of
our affiliation and the design
is an extension of our ritual.
Pins are meant to be a daily re
minder of our foundation.
Being Greek has made us
all more self-confident. We are
not afraid to voice our opinions
in a room of 85 people. The
results include teamwork, com
promise, and respect for oth
ers. Running meetings with all
these women has challenged
our leadership skills to a higher
level than

we thought possible. We
value our differences and sup
port each of our sisters not only
within our organization but the
others as well. We collectively
agree that joining a sorority was
one of the best individual deci
sions we have made in college.
We can only hope that our
pride in being Greek will ex
emplify the reasons why we
decided to make the commit
ment to Greek Life, not only
during college, but also for a
lifetime. In Sisterhood and
Panhellenic Spirit,

Greeks and independents, equal impact

As a member of a slave
producing, cattle herd forming,
alcoholic inducing, party cen
tralized organization, I obvi
ously would be completely in
clined to agree with the article
entitled "Greek Problems."
Our mind numbing, commu
nistic policies and beer guzzling
impulses have left us stupid and
without independence or indi
viduality. Furthermore, it is
downright unfortunate and
completely horrendous that
organizations like the Greek
system exist. This campus and
the world in general would be
much better off without
Greeks.
Is this really what is be
ing said about over half the
people of our campus? It sure
seems like it. Anyway, let's
examinet arguments.

First, is the argument that
Greek organizations subtract
from participation and mem
bership in other clubs and ex
tracurricular activities. Yes,
pledging does take up a great
deal of time, but the first thing
that one often fails to under
stand is that joining a Greek
organization is a life long com
mitment which effects where
you will be living, who you will
be living with, and in general,
the people who will become
your closest friends for the next
few years. Oh I'm sorry, I for
got, we brainwash our pledges

so that they have absolutely no
free will and no ability to
choose who they associate with
or what activities they choose
to do for the rest of their col
lege career. Come on, please
tell me that e some research
actually went into this. Real
ize that many of us choose to
be Greeks for the same reasons
any other person joins a politi
cal party or a different social
organization. Each of us feels
strongly about the ideals of the
chapter, and we enjoy the com
pany of the people within it.
How horrible is this?

I, and about 50% of this
campus, chose to become
Greeks, and we each deal with

the consequences of that
choice. The article praises those
who rebel against the status
quo? Which would be the
more productive choice? Is it
better to quit a system that you
willingly became a member of
and do nothing but complain
about its existence, or is it bet
ter to remain in the system and
work on improving upon its
faults? Of course I have my
problems with being Greek, I
doubt you can find one Greek
who feels the system is with
out flaw. Some of us though
work to improve upon it in
stead of quitting.
The article holds us (the
Greeks) responsible for the
same standards as other clubs
and states that we can't take
credit for any participation in
any activity we did not orga
nize. Hence, if you take away

everything that a fraternity or
sorority does or is involved in,
all that we have left is drinking
and partying. Think about the
intelligence of that last state
ment. It is analogous to the
statement that if I take away the
skin, muscle and bone from a
human body, all I have left is
the fluids within it and I refer
to this as "human." If you are
going to judge the Greek sys
tem, judge us on everything we
do, not simply that which you
consider in poor taste. Just
because you have seen Animal
House and PCU does not mean
you can judge the Gettysburg

Greek system by those stan
dards. Second, the herd atmo
sphere which the column
claims affects the Greeks so
soon after rush is over is obvi
ously true. You will not get me
to he and say that Greeks don't
travel in packs. Okay now tell
me what's wrong with this?
J ust because I choose to go to
Servo with a group of friends,
or go to the bar with my broth
ers does not mean that some
where along the line I, or any
of them have lost the capacity
for free thought. You see
though, the point of joining an
organization like a fraternity is

to understand the concepts of
cooperation and sacrifice. Each
of us functions for the good of
the whole, but do so without a
loss of morality or belief. To
make a hasty and sweeping
generalization that the herd at
titude robs one of self is com
pletely groundless. It isn't only
the voices of the independents
which "make the difference."
I was raised to believe that any
one can make a difference as
long as they keep an open mind
and give 110% to whatever

their cause might be. The ar
ticle states that the Greeks are
a negative influence. I feel they
are a necessary and useful so
cial outlet and provide a fam
ily environment to those who
choose to open their eyes and
minds to the possibilities for
personal growth. As an indi
vidual, Greek, stubborn, and
hardheaded human being I can
make just as much of a differ
ence as someone with all these
wonderful characteristics, yet is
not Greek.

In closing, please realize
the absurdity of both of our
articles because neither one is
going to make one iota of dif
ference in the lives of our read
ers. You see, maybe half of the
campus community will read
both of the pieces. Maybe a
portion of the faculty and ad
ministration will likewise pick
up a copy. And maybe a few
parents will even take some of
their time to page through, but
what I have said before and will
reiterate is simply act rather
than speak. Words and articles
are a waste of our time. For
example I have just spent the
past hour writing this rebuttal
when I could have been doing
something else which could
have affected me positively. To
change the status quo requires
demonstrable action, not ink
on a page. The pen is not
mightier than the sword and in
reality is perhaps only equal to

it. Respectfully submitted,
With hope for the future,
Joshua D. Hirsch

To the 'burg or not to the 'burg

Conflict and Comensu

by Christina Dickert
Columnist A few days ago, I was re
minded of a conversation I had
when I was home over break.
A senior from my high school
asked me how I had come to
choose Gettysburg as the place
I wanted to be for the four most
important years of my educa
tion. I was speechless. I really
never looked back to my col
lege application process, which
started about two years ago.
(Two years ago!! Geez, I'm
feeling really old.) Sorry to say
but I gave some corny answer
like, "It just grabbed me as the
place I wanted to go." That
was an absolute lie, and it both
ered me for the rest of the day.
Finally, as I laid in bed that
night trying to fight my guilty
conscience, I racked my brains
for the real answer to that ques
tion. I am so embarrassed to

admit this, but the reason why
I had chosen Gettysburg as one
of my top ten choices the spring
of my junior year was because
I really liked the pictures in the
brochure. C'mon, you know
they are nice- fall in central
Pennsylvania, a group of
friends (culturally diverse, of
course) sitting on the steps of
Musselman Library. This, for a
sixteen year old, is appealing.
Hey, it also had a political sci
ence department. I thought
that might come in handy, since
I believed that is what I wanted
my major to be.
So, in the fall, when the
Gettysburg representative came
to visit my quaint Catholic high
school, I was one of two people
interested in coming to Gettys
burg. Or at least 1 thought I
was interested. The meeting
was during seventh period,
which just happened to be the
exact same time that I had

physics. I learned a bit more
about Gettysburg, was per
suaded to come visit the cam
pus, and went to my AP English
class ten minutes late. It was a
good deal.
My interview and visit
were a complete disaster. I
wore black Adidas sneakers to
the Admissions office. My
mom could have killed me, but
Gettysburg was my fourth
choice. American University is
where I belonged- big city, no
cows, famous lawmakers, and,
the best part, five hours away
from home. I really didn't care
if I was accepted here. The tour
was even worse. I had picked
Reading Days for the perfect
weekend to visit. Even more,
it was a Saturday morning. The
campus was completely and
totally empty. Our tour guide
was at least seven feet tall, and,
considering that my mother
and I are five feet tall, we felt

like we were running a mara
thon. Let's just say that Get
tysburg did not make the im
pression on me that I was hop
ing to get.
Things didn't turn out the
way I had planned. I was ac
cepted at American, too, but
Gettysburg offered me more
financial aid. I tried getting
excited about coming here, but
I felt so cheated. Just because
money controlled where I
wanted to go, I was stuck liv
ing in this godforsaken farm
land for the next four years. I
used the same line, over and
over again to my mother, when
1 was trying to convince her to
let me transfer to Lehigh
(which is strategically placed in
my hometown) this fall when I
was homesick. I never wanted
to come here, I'd say. I felt as
though I had made no big de
cision- the financial aid had
made the choice for me.

Almost four months after
that homesick period, I find
myself running into a campus
tour every Monday and
Wednesday as I walk out of
work. As I leave the White
House, I see the perspective
first-year student with his or
her parents, walking with one
of our own peers. Walking
across the grass, I feel their cu
rious eyes follow me across the
empty campus, imagining
where I am going and what
exciting class I am heading for.
I feel like walking up to them
and telling them the answer
that I couldn't give that senior
over break. I want to tell them
that no matter where you end
up in the fall, whether it is your
first choice or your absolute last
choice, you'll end up loving it,
and, like me, who is not look
ing forward to going home
over Spring Break, you will
never want to leave it.

Wagging the dog?

by Camtnie Grant
Columnist The national media has
implied to its readers that
Desert Thunder, may be an
other Wag the Dog situation.
A couple of months ago, Wag
the Dog was released in the
aters. It is a film about a scan
dal that involves the President
covering up a sexual affair by
conspiring a war to distract the
'
President's alleged affair.
Granted Clinton has re
cently been accused of an al
leged affair with Monica
Lewinsky, but is that a reason
to move troops into the Middle
East to distract attention from
his personal life to a potential
war? Clinton is only human
and has made his fair share of

mistakes. However, putting
thousands of lives at risk and
spending endless dollars only to
help himself seems outrageous
especially when the facts re
veal that Clinton is by no A

Obviously there are serious

intervene. Favorably, Saddam

I do wish the press would
back off and stop trying to pro
pose that the Clinton scandal

is similar to Wag the Dog. I
also find it incredibly disturb
ing that according to U.S. News
and World Report, a copy of
the movie was played on Iraqi
television last week along with
clips of Albright, Cohen, and
Berger being shouted off stage
in Ohio. This just shows that
Saddam is feeding off the press
and problems in America to
make himself look better and
the United States look like one
big conspiracy. Saddam
Hussein's eyes and ears are
open to anything that can help
him and his country gain re
venge over the United States.
President Clinton, keep
your chin up. To the citizens
of America, pray for Saddam
Hussein's cooperation with the
United Nations inspectors so
that we will not have to face
war again in the Middle East.

The Greek Word

by Earl Redding and Erin

Public Relations Chairs IFC and
Panhel The Greek Word is an
article that appears almost ev
ery issue of The Gettysburgian
in which the happenings of the
Greek campus community can
be communicated to the rest of
campus. This semester the posi
tives of the Greek community
have greatly outweighed the
negatives. Greeks have been
very active in student body de
cisions such as Student Senate,
SAC, Social Life Committee,
$50,000 Spend the Money ad
hoc committee, as well as
sports and many other differ
ent clubs and committees on
campus. Greeks have been very
prevalent here at Gettysburg

not because they belong to a
certain fraternity or sorority,
but because they choose to par
ticipate in clubs,

Method Invocation"
Remote method invocation (RMI)
provides a framework for developing
distributed object systems using Java.
Using RMI, it is possible to create
Java objects whose methods can be
invoked by objects residing on
different hosts. Object serialization,
introduced in the 1.1 release of the
JDK, provides a means by which
objects can be converted to and from
a stream of bytes. Serialization makes
it possible for applications to send
full objects across a network. This
feature is utilized by RMI to provide
support for passing full objects as
parameters or return values. This talk
introduces Java RMI. It begins with
an _overview of RMI and is followed
by a simple example. Additional
examples illustrate how objects can
be passed between programs running
on different hosts.

Cupid had his turn, now bring on. St. Patrick

by Steve Jenkins
Sports Editor
So your Valentine's Day
did not pan out. Your girl
bought you all kinds of lovey
dovey crap like candy and
chocolate. All you wanted
was a big fat bowl of chicken
wings, an ice cold beer, and
the remote to the television.
Well, guess what? St. Patty's
Day is here; so if V-day was a
wash out, the next major holi
day is almost here and it is all
about guys.
Yeah, no more stupid
cherubs shooting people with
arrows. Just plain fun. Just
settle into your lazy boy, with
all of your buddies and just,
you know, consume, It's
probably the best holiday of
the year, and to add to it, the
Phillies Spring training camp
will be opening so we can see
all the nobodies and the

never-will-be's that reside on the
"Spring Training" invite list.
What was on TV on
Valentine's Day? The NBA.
Great, yet another weekend of
games where everyone in the
league is trying to defeat ot "he
like Mike." Oh, you know what,
while your girl¬

friend was _^^_M
opening _^^^^
t h e _^^H
box _^^^M
that _^^^^^
you _^^^^_J
spent _^^^^^H
your ^^^^H
season ^^^H
ticket ^^H
money on, _^B
you were
probably watch
ing the Professional

Bowlers Association _^r
as they kicked off yet an
other crowd-stimulating tour
ney in NoWhere, Montana

More tun.
Man is a simple creature.
The only thing we want on
Valentine's Day is for it to end.
We see our hard earned cash
_senselessly laced around the
necks and wrists of our loved
ones, as we figure out how
many hot dogs we could have
_^^^

bought light with all the
din era we _^
spent A
_i ' _&*» jm

_^^H simple ^|i
_^^^^V p. I 1
_^^m love y ou. 1
_^^^_r You know what _^
_^^ most of us guys
r never tell our girlfriends
but yell at Ricky Watters
as he prances into the end

zone. That is the one. "If lov
ing Ricky is wrong... I don't
want to be right," as my friends
would say.
Your girl gave you some

chocolate, maybe a shirt, and
then prances you all over town

for _^_Bj
dinner while you could be *
doing something cool--like
watching bowling. Hey, any
thing is better than a dinner
where you actually have to
wipe your mouth and concen
trate on using real silverware.

Man, the nerve of women. We
get involved with them, while
all along they know all we love

is football and food, and then
they try to domesticate us. No
way.

On the other

ended 17-8. She has been play
ing basketball since she was in
the second grade and also
played soccer and softball in
high school.
The thing that is so spe
cial about Karyn is that she has
been on the basketball team
here at Gettysburg for four
years, but she has not gotten a
significant amount of playing
time in any particular season.
Even so, she is still one of the
hardest workers on the team.
This is a characteristic
that many strive for, but few

that goals can be accomplished if
people dedicate themselves to at
taining them.
The men's team achieved
so much this year because they
were dedicated to accomplish
ing their goals. Reflecting on
the season and his four years
at Gettysburg, Pete said, "I'd
like to thank the guys swim
team and Coach Rawleigh for
staying so dedicated this year,
but most of all I'd like to thank
Todd, Greg and Chris for the
best four years of my life in and
out of the pool.
"Both Janel Pfeifer and
Pete Casares have gained an
immeasurable amount from

game of basketball also keeps
her around. The true test of
her dedication occurred during
a practice over Christmas
break. While running sprints
during practice, Karyn felt
pains in her chest. She knew it
had to be serious because she
was already in condition,
thanks to Coach Kirkpatrick's
rigorous preseason and season
practices.
Albanesius did not want
to take any chances, so she got
examined by a doctor. It was,
in fact, a heart murmur. Luck
ily for Karyn, the doctor said
it was not life-threatening and
she would be able to continue
playing basketball. She came
back and did not miss a step.
Karyn passed this test with fly
ing colors.

The last home game for
Karyn and the rest of the se
niors, on Saturday Feb. 21, was
full of excitement. It was a big
game against Franklin &
Marshall. "I wanted everyone
to do well since it was an im
portant game," said Karyn.
They did, so did she. Karyn
started the game, scored the
first bucket, and played as
though she had been starting

their experiences on
Gettysburg's swim team. They
have both learned important
life lessons and made lifelong
friendships. For four years Pete
and Janel have dedicated them
selves to a strong swim pro
gram and they have each set
and accomplished many goals.
In closing Coach
Rawleigh commented, "Both
Pete and Janel have been very
accomplished in their sport and
they both have really contrib
uted to the success of the pro
gram." The great success and
lessons learned at Gettysburg
will help both Janel and Pete
to be happy, successful people.

all season. She says, "It was
niceto play well in front of my
family. I was so excited. It
was fun."
Not many student-ath
letes have the dedication to
stick with a sport when they
are not getting much playing
time, but the athletes that do
stay with it ought to be com
mended. So if you see Karyn
around campus before she
graduates this May, thank her
for all the effort she put forth
to make the Lady Bullets a bet

Pete Casares and Janel Pfeifer led their respective swim teams to yet another Conference Title

By Chesha Miller
Player Profiler
Seventeen years ago,
when they were both five years
old, seniors Pete Casares and
Janel Pfeifer began their swim
ming careers. The pair, who
were to become future Gettys
burg College swim team cap
tains, started racing during
their summers for country club
swim teams.
When Janel was eight,
she began competing all year
round, while Pete waited until
the " seventh grade for year
round competitions. Pfeifer
and Casares have both left their
mark in Gettysburg's pool.
Pfeifer is an extremely

well versed swimmer. "Janel is
probably the most versatile ath
lete we've ever had," explained
Gettysburg head swim coach
Mike Rawleigh. "She's tough
and a very good competitor
who is willing to swim any
event that will help the team."
Janel has had the oppor
tunity to do just that, swim
ming the 200 yard , 500 yard
and 1000 yard freestyle, 200
yard butterfly, 200 yard back
stroke and the 400 yard Indi
vidual Medley. Pfeifer, who is
considered a distance swimmer,
has also competed in the long
est swimming race, the 1650
yard freestyle, which swimmers
fondly dub the "mile".

As a junior, she finished
third in the Centennial Confer
ence Championships in the
mile. During the Centennial
Conference Championship
meet her first year, Janel was
the bronze medalist in the 500
yard freestyle and was Centen
nial Conference runner-up in
thebackstrokc.
Janel's favorite event and the
even in which she has achieved die
greatest success is the back
stroke. "1 love the backstroke,"
explained Janel, "because it was
something 1 was always good
at." One of Pfeifer's fondest
swimming memories is when
she won the 100 yard back
stroke at the District meet dur
ing high school.
In her first swim race,
seventeen years ago, Pfeifer

swam the butterfly. Poignantly,
this past weekend at the Cen
tennial Conference Champion
ships Janel finished her swim
ming career with the butterfly.
"It was a really good way to end
[my swimming career]- doing
what got me into swimming,"
Pfeifer com- i

mented. Janel's
parents, Rory
and Josephine,
were very
touched by this
sentimental closure.
Through
out her swim
ming career
Janel has been
greatly sup
ported by her
parents and her
P o p - P o p
George. Her
father has
never missed a
race and her
grandfather even scheduled
surgery around
Janel's swim
season.

Having
her parents
with her
through all her
ups and downs
has forged a
very close rela
tionship be
tween the
three. "One of
the most im
portant things

Pholo courlesy ol PeleCasares
Pete Casares stands atop the podium claiming a medal for
Gettysburg College.

swimming has
done for me is
it made
mat u maue me

r rn
ciose to

gee my
parents," Janel said.
Pfeifer has learned a lot
from swimming. It has been
the backbone of her life and has
taught her about all the ups and
downs life has to offer. Swim
ming has also given Pfeifer hei
own identity and made her a ie
sponsible and dedicated person.
Janel realizes that success
will only come to her it she puts
the 110% success requires into
everything she does. Janel loves
swimming for Gett\sbuig's" s
close-knit team. "Wc_^'Mo
close because we want to k\
not because we have to be"

Pfeifer explained of
Gettysburg ^"s men~"s and
women's team.
"Both the girl's and guy's
teams are so close to each other
in and out of the pool. We have
been through all the good and
bad times together and every¬

one helps each other out."
In addition to being cap
tain of Gettysburg's swim team,
Janel is very involved with her
sorority, Gamma Phi Beta. She
is a management major and
economics minor. Looking to
wards the future Janel wishes
to be "a happv successful per
son." Senioi Pete Casares has
been !upp\ and successful in
his accomplishments. Casares,
who is a >.piintei and middle
distance swim hum, h.is had a
\i'i\ muwnsIuI swimming _c\-
im .it Gem shut;. He holds
ihuvot Gem shut _u'_mik1i\ idual

school records, in the 200 yard
IM (1:58.42), 100 yard butter
fly (50.97) and the 200 yard
butterfly (1:54.07).
In addition, he is a mem
ber of all hve of Gettysburg's
record holding relay teams, the
200 yard , 400 yard and 80

yard freestyle
relays as
well as
the 200
yard and
400 yard
medley relays.
Through
out his
career Pete has
also held
various Centen
nial Con
fer e n c e
records.
The.
past
week
end, at
the Cen
t e n n l a 1
Con fer-

e n c e
Champi
onships,
Pete qualified for his
third Na
11 o n a 1
Swim
m i n g
Champi
onships.
Over

spring break Pete will travel to
St. Louis to compete in the 100
yard and 200 yard butterfly, as
well as the 200 yard and 400
yard freestyle lelays.
Pete is ecstatic to have
some company at Nationals
this season. In fact, this season
he told Ins teammates he wasn't
going to Nationals without
them. Fortunately, Pete will be
at Nationals and he will have
sonic company with his friends
and fellow relay partners, Todd
Peters, Rich Carroll and Dave
_Lavigne. At Nationals the re
lay ream will have the oppor
tunity to compete in the 200

yard, 400 yard and 800 yard
freestyle relays.
"I am really excited to be
going with them, it was a team
goal," Casares explained about
the excitement of the team
qualifying for Nationals.
"We broke the 400 yard
freestyle record by 3.0 seconds
[at Centennials] and we knew
we were all going to make it.
It is the best memory." Casares
hopes to return from St. Louis
an All-Amencan in his indi
vidual events and along with
his relay team.
Pete has achieved his suc
cesses from his extreme dedi
cation and consistent hard
work during his four years at
Gettysburg. He understands
that if you work hard at some
thing, good things will come of
it. "You have to work to be suc
cessful," Pete explained.

Successful is just what
Casares is. According to Coach
Rawleigh Pete has improved
greatly over his four years be
cause he has tried to do every
thing right. "Pete is a real stu
dent of the sport- he under
stands swimming technique
very well," Rawleigh com
mented. "He really zeroes in
and is able to concentrate on
his strokes and turns.
"There is no wasted ef
fort in his swimming." Casares
is very focused on his swim
ming and likes to be thought

of as someone who is dedi
cated, hardworking and moti
vated. Swimming has been in
valuable to Pete Casares. It has
taught him dedication, disci
pline and how to set and
achieve goals, but most impor
tantly Pete has gained true
friendships through swimming.
"The senior class on the swim
team is really close," explained
Casares. "We've lived together
since sophomore year and they
are the best friends I could ever
ask for."

Pete is especially proud of
the success of the swim team
this season. He is a firm believer
