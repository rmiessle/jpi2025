Attack at Lamp Post!!!

Early in the morning of Satur-

day, Sep
tember 18,
a male
Gettysburg College
student was as
saulted on
East
Stevens Street be
t w e e n
Lamp Post
and Carlisle
House residence hall. The
student had been
dropped
off by a
friend

near Lamp Post and was returning to
Carlisle House when two white males
approached him. The two males, de
scribed as stocky and wearing light
colored shorts and flannel shirts, as
saulted the student and took his wal
let. They then left the scene, running
east on East Stevens Street.
The assault occurred near 2:24
a.m. The student was taken to the
Gettysburg Hospital and treated for
injuries he sustained during the attack.
After treatment, he was released to
return to campus.
College Safety and Security sent
a Campus Crime Announcement to
the-campus via email in order to warn
students of the incident and to ask for
any information which could help to
apprehend the attackers. As of yet,
however, no leads have turned up.
This incident is reminiscent of
several attacks that occurred in the

spring semester near the 7-11 conve
nience store. Added to the recent series
of break-ins at the newly converted
Appleford Inn, this latest occurrence
shows an alarming trend of growing vio-

Regarding safety on
campus, an anonymous stu
dent commented, "I am dis
mayed at the recent violence
that has-manifested itself on
our campus. Students have
a right to feel safe on this
campus and Safety and Se
curity needs to ensure that
this right is protected."
More emergency call
boxes were added across
campus this summer. Their
purpose, however, is di
rected more toward allowing
students to call tor admit-

tance to residence halls than g_^ ' * I ||||MMnrT"T"_^ iBi

The necessity for the call _^^^^SSHHBiVKiil

While last year's assaults
formed a disturbing pattern, the
Lamp Post attack is the only one of
its kind so far this year. It is hoped
_^^m_^m that w'th cooperation be¬

tween students and
Safety and Security, past
tiends of violence can be
avoided.

Texas church crime scene
returns to place of worship

By Term Langford
Knigh t-Ridder
_Newspapers
FORT WORTH, Texas -
Wedgwood Baptist Church re
verted from a crime scene to a
place of worship Sunday.
Gone were the church'_s
stained carpets. The exposed
concrete floors served as a re
minder of Larry Gene
Ashbrook's angry rampage, a
shooting that left seven dead
and seven injured just four days
earlier.
For the faithful,
Wedgwood Pastor Al Meredith
brought a message of hope.
"God is in control and he
loves us," Meredith told about
1,500 church members and
guests who poured into the

church for two Sunday services.
"He will turn evil for good. He
is in control."
Meredith reminded wor
shipers that even when tragedy
strikes, God's grasp remains
tightly around them.
He talked of the over
whelming response the church
was receiving from around the
world via the Internet. On Sun
day, church corridor walls were
covered with dozens of elec
tronic mail messages - from
among 7,000 received thus far.
"Bad things do happen to
good people, but God turns
them together for good,"
Meredith said. "It's heartaches
like this that shape and pattern
us." In one card, hand-deliv
ered to the church, a woman
told the congregation that not
only did she send her prayers,

but she also hoped to find in
herself the confidence that
church members this week ex
hibited in their faith.
"God puts the lives to
gether again," Meredith said.
"I've seen wonderful things
come out of this tragic event."
Meredith turned to the
Bible's New Testament to un
derscore his sermon, titled
"Where is God in All of This?"
He read aloud from Ro
mans 8:28: "And we know that
in all things God works for the
good of those who love him,
who have been called accord
ing to his purpose."
Outside the church, flow
ers, candles and signs formed a
shrine to the seven people
gunned down Wednesday. Af
ter the service, teenage church
members prayed and held one
another as they read the signs.

Meredith tried to con
front the fears of the youngest
worshipers during the
"children's sermon." He used
the Mother Goose rhyme
"Humpty Dumpty" to address
the shooting.
"We've had a great fall
this week," he told about 25
children gathered at his feet
near the church's altar. "Some
one came into church and
started shooting people. Some
of them died."
But Meredith stressed to
them and the rest of the con
gregation that despite the ter
rific loss, "Many wonderful
things have come out of this."
Many church members
said they left the services com
forted and eager to apply les
sons from the horrific week's

get you where you are sate.
You've got to take light to the
darkness. I think you're going
to see some good out of this."
Robert Dimmick, a semi
nary student, agreed.
"It is a reminder that no
matter what happens that God
has not left us," he said.
For Carl Bodiford, whose
12-year-old daughter Erin wit
nessed the shooting, it was a
particularly emotional week.
"As a Christian we know
we live in a world that has
fallen. It is not an immuniza
tion against bad things happen
ing" he said.
But faith has helped him
and his family get thiough this
trying week and focus on small
miracles.
He pointed our that
Ashbrook still had several
unfired clips of ammunition
when, for some reason, he de
cided to take his own life.

e.
Mary Moore, a worker at
nearby Southwestern Baptist
Theological Seminary, became
a member at Wedgwood on
Sunday.
"It says in the Bible the
Lord gives the power not timid
ity," she said of the shooting.
"The Devil is going to try to

"They say he had six
_magazines left," Bodiford said.
"I think God intervened."

Second man tried in
dragging death found
guilty

By Barry Shlachter
Knight-Ridder
Newspapers
BRYAN, Texas - White
supremacist Lawrence Russell
Brewer, who described himself
in prison notes as a "soaring
eagle" and "hero of the day,"
was brought down to earth on
Monday when a jury found him
guilty of capital murder in the
dragging death of a black man.
Brewer, 32, who has
served time for house burglary,
showed no emotion when the
jury of five women and seven
men, including one Hispanic,
announced its verdict after four
hours of deliberation in the sec
ond trial to arise from the tor
ture slaying of James Byrd Jr.
in Jasper, Texas, last summer.
"So far, so good," the
victim's father, James Byrd Sr.,
said after the punishment phase
of the trial began. Brewer could
be sentenced to death, or life

n prison.
The prosecution on Tues
day will call one more witness,
a psychiatrist, to testify about
whether Brewer represents a
future threat to society. Defense
lawyers declined to say how
many witnesses they plan to
call, but the jury is expected to
begin deliberating Brewer's
punishment on Wednesday.
"The second weight has
been lifted from our shoul
ders," Byrd's sister Mary
Verrett told reporters. She said

testimony showed Brewer en
joyed what he did to my
brother."
"He was tortured, then
he was killed and they got
much satisfaction out of that,"
Verrett said. "And we the Byrd
family are satisfied right now."
Jasper County District
Attorney Guy James Gray said
he was relieved at the verdict.
The South Central Texas jury
took 90 minutes longer to con
vict Brewer than a Jasper jury
took find John William King
guilty in Jasper. King was sen¬

tenced to death. The third man
charged, Shawn Berry, 24, is
expected to be tried in the fall.
"After 22 years, it doesn't
get any easier," Gray said. "It
scares you. Everyone was ner
vous." The trial was shifted from
Jasper in East Texas, where the
killing occurred, 135 miles
west of Bryan because of pre
trial publicity.
"All of Texas, particularly
East Texas, is embarrassed by
that history (of racial violence)
from 60 to 70 years ago," Gray
said. "When Jasper turned the
case against Bill King, some
people would say they were just
trying to protect themselves.
When you move it half way
across the state of Texas and
another jury returns a guilty
verdict, it kind of broadens the
scope, speaks for the whole
state of Texas."

Gray said the DNA evi
dence placing Brewer at the
scene where Byrd was beaten
and chained behind a pickup
was the strongest evidence. The
case, he said, got a major boost
when Brewer testified, ac
knowledging he was at the
scene and confirming he
smoked and drank there.
"The just punishment for
this case in this set of circum
stances is death_,"Gray said.
"Will he be a danger in the fu
ture? I don't see any answer to
that but, yes, he will be a dan
ger." During the trial, Brewer
- an exalted cyclops of a prison
Ku Klux Klan gang and self
described Aryan warrior - in
termittently sobbed last week
as he told the jury that he had
no intention to kill Byrd. He
blamed Berry for slashing
Byrd's throat, then dragging
him for 3 miles behind the
pickup.

In his closing argument,
Gray said Brewer took the
stand to craft a scenario that
put him at the scene - which
DNA evidence had proved - but

made himself out to be a non
participant in Byrd's kidnap
ping and slaying.
"He admitted enough to
comply with the facts ... and
just staying short of the death
penalty," Gray said.
"There were three men in
the truck, three men who
smoked and three men who
had blood on their shoes," said
Gray, who listed the three dif
ferent accounts Brewer gave of
his actions to authorities before
the trial, in prison notes, and
in his testimony.
"He's a racist white su
premacist like Bill King," the
prosecutor said.
In his testimony, Brewer
blamed Byrd's kidnapping and
murder on Berry, who was the
first suspect to give an account
to investigators. He said
Brewer cut Byrd's throat before
chaining him behind the
pickup.

But in his closing state
ment, Gray said the dragging
marks started more than 60
feet from where Byrd was
beaten, and there wasn't
enough blood at the scene or
on Berry's clothes to corrobo
rate Brewer's account that
Byrd's throat was cut.
"He lied when he told
you he wasn't a racist and he
lied when he told you Shawn
Berry cut James Byrd Jr.'s
throat," Gray said.
The prosecutor said that
Byrd was alive and conscious
before he was chained to the
bumper of Berry's pickup, and
that, judging from the black
man's size, it took three men
to subdue him long enough to
fasten the chain.
"There's a tremendous
amount of pressuie for a con
viction," Layne Walker, one of
Brewer's defense attorneys,
said in his closing arguments.
"I know it. You know it. They
know it," he said, referring to
prosecutors.

"They did a good job of
making you hate Russell
Brewer."

_^ __ ,- students playing in the dirt in Mexico over spring break

service learning:

explore your world

said Stefano. "The experi- Dominican Republic, and New York
ences that I had were really City. Projects are filling up fast, so stu
hands-on, and this was what dents who are interested should apply

piling applications for the various
projects, to getting word out about each
of them, their jobs take a great deal of
effort each day. It's this effort that
makes the projects so special and allows
each participant to gain a greater insight
into service.
"There are three components that
we hope each participant gets from ser
vice-learning projects," said O'Byrne.

this experience on her servicelearning
project at the University of Maryland
Medical Center. "I am on the pre-med
track at Gettysburg, and my experience
in the hospital gave me a deeper under¬

standing
of what
my fu
ture will
be like,"

1 needed to reaffirm my desire to go to
medical school.
Other students feel the same way
about the experiences they have had on
service-learning projects. "In my two

weeks in San Francisco, I gained a bet
ter understanding of myself and who I
want to be," said O'Byrne. "I learned
so much in such a small period of time
- more than I could learn in any text
book." That is what service learning
projects enable students to do. One part
of college life might be to read and learn
what's in a book, but the experience is
much more whole when a student can
learn outside of the classroom.
Service learning projects are of
fered over reading days, winter break,
spring break, and after graduation. The
deadline for winter break projects is
Friday October 1st, Spring Break, Fri
day February 4th, and for after gradua
tion, Friday April 7th. When a partici
pant registers for a project, a $100 de
posit is due to the Center for Public
Service. Trips that are still open for
winter, include Washington DC, Univer
sity of Maryland Medical Center, San
Francisco, Alabama, the Apache Reser
vation, and Nicaragua. Spring break
trips that are open include Mexico, the

Students help out in a kitchen in Washington over winter break

early. Another thing that the Center for
Public Service encourages is for students
who don't think they can afford trips
to apply. Students can fill out award ap-

plica-t
i o ns
to fill
out
and

give to the Center for Public Service.
There is money available to students in
both the need based areas and non need
based areas.
It's even possible to earn a half
credit on the longer break service
learning projects through the Interde
partmental Studies Department. By
completing all the requirements stipu
lated in the service learning booklet, stu
dents can take advantage of this S/U
credit course.
If you are thinking about going on
a service learning project, talk to some
one who has gone on one. They'll be
more than happy to talk about it.
"Service learning trips give you
the opportunity to remove your shoes
and to put yourself into someone
else's," said Rogers. "In doing so, you
have a unique opportunity to look at
the world from a different perspective,
and to experience a life completely op
posite your own - in short, two weeks
can change your life."

Are you tired of going home and
sitting on the couch during Winter
Break? How about Spring Break? If you
want to try something different on a
vacation this year, why not consider
taking part in a service learning project?
It's a fun way to help the community
and gain some great experience in the
process.
This year's service-learning team
is made up of seniors Lavinia Rogers
and Jaci Mongiello, and junior Megan
O'Byrne. Their jobs as coordinators are
to oversee each of the 16 projects that
will go out to many places throughout
the country and world - including Rus
sia, Jamaica, and even the University of
Maryland Medical Center. From com-

"To render service to the community
where they are staying, to learn from
their experiences at the project site, and
to bring those lessons back to the cam
pus community and apply them to their
everyday life." The Center for Public
Service hopes that this aspect of learn
ing will pervade each participant's ex
perience and make it a much more re
warding trip.
The motto for the Center for Pub
lic Service is "building bridges". Each
time a Gettysburg College student ven
tures out into the community to do ser
vice, they are forging a bond with that
community - both for themselves and
for the College. "The bridge, once built,
is not a one way bridge though," said
O'Byrne. "Rather it's a two way bridge
on which interactions take place, friend
ships are made, and knowledge is trans
ferred". J unior Tara Stefano had just

You know Kevin
Costner's career is in trouble
when he goes back to making
baseball movies. Costner suc
ceeds again in this third install
ment of his baseball trilogy
(thus far). For Love of the
Game doesn't surprise, aston
ish, or shock you; what it does
is keep you in your seat as you
watch Billy Chapel (Costner)
relive the past five years of his
life while playing in what could
be the last game of his career.
Chapel is a forty-year
old, nineteen-year veteran of
the Detroit Tigers. Through

majors, and a guaranteed future

member of the hall of fame.
Now in this last year, his age
begins to show through a los
ing record. The owner of the
Tigers is planning on selling the
team and the new owners want
to trade Chapel from the Ti
gers, the only professional team
he has known, to the San Fran
cisco Giants. The owner warns
Chapel of the plan so that
Chapel can make the decision
to retire to avoid the trade.
If you think Chapel's life
in complicated at this point,
there's more. Chapel's on

a journalist who has no love for
baseball, stood him up the
night before, then told him she
is leaving for a job in England,
thus ensuring the relationship
is off permanently.

pieces of information the same

day he is scheduled to pitch
against the division leading

second to last game of the year.

mate now plays for the Yan
kees, as does another old team
mate who signed with the Yan
kees as a free agent.

It is dur
ing the game
and flash
backs where
the movie be
gins appeal to
both genders.
The males get
to see plenty
of baseball ac
tion as we
witness
Chapel in the
zone, pitching
the best game
of his career.
What puts
him in the
zone are his
thoughts of
Jane and the

evolution of
their relationship.
He is so lost in his
thoughts it isn't until the eighth
inning that Chapel realizes that
he is pitching a perfect game.
The team comes together on
the field like it hasn't all year,

in an attempt to preserve the
perfect game.
If you haven't seen the
movie yet, it isn't tough to fig
ure out the ending. Though
short on surprises, and with
little suspense until the end, For

The movie is adapted from the
novel by Michael Shaara (does
that name sound familiar?) and
the adaptation keeps the plot
from being too convoluted or
one-sided.
The setting of Yankee Sta¬

dium is the perfect backdrop
for such a movie. Who else
besides the Yankees are so uni
versally hated by everyone but
their fans?
Director Sam Raimi, of
Army of Darkness fame, does
a good j _' ob in depicting
Chapel's zone by fading out the
noise and the stadium in the
background. (On a side
note, let me say that it's

definitely a good
thing that Costner
did not direct
this.) Kelly
Preston is great
in die role of
_^H Jane, and her
_^H daughter
_^H Heather,
_^H played by
_^^_B newcomer

Jena Malone,
provides a
nice modern
touch to the
story.

Ignore
the critics who feel that
Costner is too depressed
throughout the movie; I would
be too if the only team I played
for wanted to trade me just as
my girlfriend told me she is
leaving for a job across the At
lantic and didn't want to see me
again.

Love of the Game is what many
movies try to be: a perfect date
movie. The great thing about
For Love of the Game is that
there is something for every
body. The baseball scenes sat
isfy those looking for sports,
and the flashback scenes satisfy
those looking for romance.

All in all, if you come
away disappointed from this
movie, you have a heart of
stone and are not a baseball fan,
because it had even this Yankee
fan starting to cheer for
Chapel's perfection.

Wild Things ROAR

by Steve Spicer
Movie Reviewer
One guy, two women,
and loads of sex make a great
movie, right? Well, if the guy
is Matt Dillon and the women
are Neve Campbell and Denise
Richards, the answer is a big,
"Oh yeah!" The posters for

Wild Things must have
read "Puritans and any
people of moderate
morals should avoid
seeing this movie at all
costs." The cast is
straight off of
Hollywood's "it" list.
Strangely, though, this
picture didn't receive
much nrtention. Per-

the guys!), this film has a very
complex and compelling plot.
The story revolves around Sam
Lombardo's (Dillon) role as a
high school guidance counse
lor. He's not the usual SAT
pushing, college application
guru we all think or immedi
ately, but a hip guy who actu
ally cares about his students.
His caring is where Suzie

haps the reviewers felt it was
too racy for the mainstream or
maybe the menage a trots scene
was too much for them. That's
right. I said menage a trots.
These three stars, all still
on the rise, take it off and get
dirty. None ever hit the "full
monty " but hey, that's what we
have imaginations for, right?
Beyond the sex (as if I
haven't already hooked all of

Toller (Campbell) comes in. As
the black sheep of the school,
she always turns to Dillon for
help. At times one wonders
exactly how much "help" she
gets from him.
On the other end of that
spectrum lies Kelly Van Ryan
(Richards). The rich, cool,
popular, pretty, generally ideal
student who can't seem to get
Mr. Lombardo to notice her.

Despite all of her advances, Mr.
Lombardo regards her as a stu
dent and nothing more.
So it seems.
One rape, another rape,
the admission of a lie, a con
spiracy, a lawsuit, and eight
million dollars are all used to
create the atmosphere for the
conclusion of the film.
I would say that someone
^^^_ gets double-crossed at
_^^^^ the end, but a quin
^^^fl tuple cross is closer to
^^^_J the truth. Following
_^^_J more plot twists than
_^M Neve Campbell has
_^M curves sounds tough,
_^H but the screenplay is
_^^^M writte n so well that it's
_^^^H not a problem.
_^^^^ The story takes
off after only twenty
minutes and doesn't slow down
until the end of the credits.

Enjoyable as either the
study-break-quickie movie or
the plan-a-party-around-it
style, this one is sure not to dis
appoint. After all, a film this
full of murder, sex, drugs, and
basic nastiness is sure to leave
everyone feelings a little wild.
I give it four out of five
stars.

' BY LlBBY MUSSELMAN
i__ ___
i' Dear Libby,
i Why not start a paper
' back book exchange? People
, could trade in their old cheesy
1 romance novels for ones they
i haven't read.
> _, Libby loves romance
> novels—the cheesier the bet
\ ter, and would be happy to
»trade some of hers for some
of yours. Ditto for mysteries
> and sci fi. Libby also wel
comes initiatives that make
i the library more meaningful
to the people who use it, and
, will entertain any good idea.
I suggest you contact
, our library director, Robin
Wagner, to see if a shelf could

be set up somewhere in the li
brary for this kind of exchange.
She'd likely go for it if it was
student run and managed. Her
email is rowagner.
Dear Libby,
There should be a bath
room on the third and fourth
floors of the library.
Libby couldn't agree with
you more, and wonders what
the architect was thinking of
when he designed a five story
building with only four public
restrooms. For those of you
who haven't discovered the
restroom locations, they are by
the elevator on the second and
fourth floors.
I wish I had better news

for you, but there is about as
much chance of adding
restrooms on the third and
fourth floors as there is of put
ting a cafeteria in the library.
Like none.
Unfortunately there is no
plumbing at the upper eleva
tions except the water fountain.
The library will be undergoing
some major building renova
tions over the next five years
and Libby will remind her
friends drawing up the library
master plan, that she had three
requests for more bathrooms in
one week. In the meantime
you'll just have to get your ex
ercise on the stairs.

From Theatre Department
En route from their suc
cessful Off-Broadway run in
New York City, Squonk will
bring their
Bigsmorgdsberdwunderwerk to
Gettysburg College on Sept.

27-29, 1999.
"Cutlery comes alive, hu
man beings spout multiple ap
pendages, and severed heads
sing" in
_Btgsmorgasbordwundet ivcrk, a
theatrical and musical frolic
compliments of a Pittsburgh
based group known as Squonk.
Squonk will land on our
collective plate with their per
formance of
_Bigsmorgasbordwunderwerk Wed., Sept. 29 at 8:00 PM in
the College Union Building
(CUB) Ballroom. According to
New York leviews, the wild
show offers "a flood of con
traptions, visual jokes and glo
riously eccentric music..."
(Time Out, New York). Re
viewer Steven Boone said that
the group is "possibly on its
way to brand-name popular
ity."

The Adams County Arts
Council, along with the Per
forming Arts Committee and
Department of Theatre Arts of
Gettysburg College, are proud
to bring in Squonk this fall, just
as the group enters the national
limelight.
There will also be a par
ticipatory workshop with
Squonk open to the public at
7:00 PM on Tues., Sept. 28 in
the CUB Ballroom. For this,
no tickets or reservations are

necessary.
Alternately called
"Debussy Meets Godzilla" (The
Washington Post) and "traces of
Laurie Anderson, Kurt Weill,
medieval chant and rap" (The
Chicago Reader),
Bigsmorgasbordwunderwerk
features a bizarre blend of art,
music and movement. Musi
cal numbers include "Fantasia
de la Suisse army," "Vulcan
Verks," and "In the Kitchen of
the Mountain King." When
singer Jana Losey performs the
songs, "Spoon," "Blade," and
"Drank Big Drink," Squonk_'s

surreal designs, music and
lighting give household items
personality and "a sinister,
goofy power" (Time Out).
Squonk is comprised of T
Weldon Anderson, double bass;
Jackie Dempsey, piano, key
board and accordion; Steve
O'Hearn, wind synthesizer,
sax, Celtic flute; Kevin
Kornicki, electronic and world
percussion; and vocalist/chore
ographer Jana Losey. As a per
formance art outfit, they enter
tain, thteaten, challenge and
stimulate the sensibilities, at
once celebrating and poking
fun at musical and theatrical

con.
Show Business reviewei
Nick Brandi: "The enure
plot—yes, amid all the chaos
lies a single theme—is an ex
tended metaphor comparing a
trip thiough the food-prep pto
cess (piobably from the per
spective of the food itself) with
the cold butchery and hot con
tempt of perdition's flames.
From the pristine egg of
life, through the entire sot did
mess and back again, the audi
ence is taken, sometimes mtei
actively, on a rollei-toastei of
musical, technical and even ar
chitectural majesty that would
make Disney spin on its mousy
ear... if one is seeking a mind
expanding experience in cie
ative expression,
Bigsmorgashurdwundeiwerk,
by Squonk, is quite literally the
chef d'ocuvre of peifotmance
nrr."

Letter to the Editor

One bad apple does
not spoil the bunch
Picture this scene: a group of five
Gettysburg students is walking
out of the diner after a typical late
Saturday night snack. One is so in
volved in a conversation with her
friends that she doesn't notice two
"townies" walking towards her. She
doesn't notice, that is, until one of them
walks up to her and kisses her. The girl
is surprised, but not really angry until
she tries to keep walking and the guy
accuses her of being disrespectful and
"indifferent and snobbish," like the
people that I.A. Isherwood referred to
in his recent column.
Now, she doesn't think that most
people would call her any of these
tilings, so she tries to explain this to this
random man. He isn't happy with her
explanations, of course, but she is fi¬

nally able to move on and go home, af
ter getting some help from her friends.
Now fast-forward a semester. I
never reported this incident, and I am
certainly not terrified of everyone that
lives in the town of Gettysburg. If
Melynda McBeth can't even walk
through town "without putting a pro
tective hand on her purse" she is insult
ing the townspeople and is certainly
making a poor example of college stu
dents. Just because she had a lapse in
judgement and made some bad deci
sions doesn't mean that all the towns
people are liars and thieves.
Instead, I feel that Mr. Isherwood
was more on track with his September
9 column. He is not "defending the
town" as Ms. McBeth insists, but merely
bringing to our attention a stereotype
that she clearly illustrates. The way

some students act towards the people
that live in this town is appalling. I may
have had a bad experience with one
resident, but that doesn't automatically
make them all horrible people. In fact,
I've met many very respectable people
by volunteering at the Fire Department
and frequenting local establishments.
Like Mr. Isherwood, I sometimes find
myself embarrassed to acknowledge
that I'm a student at the College when
I see the way some students treat the
town and its people.
This happehs especially when stu
dents go into town to drink. Very of
ten, students appear to take these places
for granted. If you're going to drink, it
should be done responsibly, without
doing harm to the town or its establish¬

ments.
The local bars may get a good deal
of business from college students, but
that doesn't mean that we own the
places. If you can't respect where you
are and the people you're around, you
probably shouldn't be there. It's about
time that we realize that these past in
cidents are due to individual actions, not
a town or campus-wide conspiracy to
destroy "the enemy." Sometimes people
make irresponsible decisions, and it
doesn't matter whether they are stu
dents or "townies." No matter who
they are, they are going to have to face
the consequences of their actions. I feel
that if the fear and anger continues the
way Ms. Mcbeth obviously wants it to,
the relationship between the town and
the college will get much worse. We as
students need to realize that we only
go to school here, and we need to start
respecting the people of this town, as
well as their rights and their properties.
Sincerely,
Kathleen Welton'01

Consider This....

Should Safety and Security be renamed "Party Patrol?"
Recent campus events have promped some students to ques
tion what Security's main goal is. How is it possible that a student
could be mugged and beaten within sight of the Security Office?
Is the College putting too much time and effort into stopping drink-

curbing that social trend is a difficult, long
term project. Of more immediate concern
•to students that live here is their physical
safety. It should not be possible for some
one to be attacked in the fifty feet between
Lamppost and Carlisle House, the site of
Saturday night's attack.
Furthermore, Security is often difficult
when students request access to academic
facilities they are required to be in after
hours. The after-hours lists are often mixed
up, and the officers always seem to com
plain about having to divert from their
schedule to open a locked door.
The bottom line is that security exists
to serve the campus population. Student
safety and academics come first, drinking
control comes second.

ing on a campus that simply won t stop?
It is a shame that so much drinking occurs at Gettysburg, but

It is not possible to stop every party;
students are still going to drink too much
and some will get sick and learn their les
son. That's all part of the maturation pro
cess that happens at college. People are
not going to stop drinking because some
one breaks up their party on the weekend.
It's a social phenomenon, one whose solu
tion is beyond the scope of the campus
police.

Safety and Security should concern itself with preventing vio
lence and ensuring that students have access to the facilities they
need to. Students should not be mugged or beaten because
security was too busy hunting down parties.

Think Hunting is a Sport?

Rsk the Deer

By Rick Deutsch
Columnist

Once when I was about
11, I shot a small bird with a
beebee gun from short range.
The thrill of my first kill (hunt
ing experience) ended with a
_resoundingthnd after its
downward spiral towards the
earth. My friend marveled at
my marksmanship but I could
take no pride in what I had
done. I wondered to myself
whether a few seconds of
praise from my comrade
was worth the life of the V

.
For the next few
days, I was torn over _^ _a
whether or not what I _^5
had done was accept
able, and only now do I
realize that it was not. I at
tribute my senseless behavior
to the innately rambunctious
and reckless tendencies of all
young boys and therefore
don't presently consider my
self to be an overly-aggressive
person.
Grown men who do kill
animals for pleasure or "sport"

however, have no such alibi.
There is, in the eyes of the hu
mane and the reasonable,
nothing right about hunting.
Firstly, to defend those of
us who participate in what we
call "sports," before the match
begins, all of us athletes or
gamers have what we consider
to be a worthy adversary.
From high divers to lineback
ers to NASCAR drivers, all of
us compete against an oppo
nent wh:> could conceivably
emerge victorious and send us
home losers.

Only, in diving and foot
ball, if you attempt to earn the
most points and fail, your op
ponent has earned more than
you. And in auto racing, if you
try to reach the finish line first
and fail, someone else has
reached it before you. In hunt
ing however, if you attempt to

kill a deer and fail, why aren't
you killed by the deer?
"Emerging victorious," in no
other sport I know with the
possible exception of rugby
does not and cannot mean for
the winner, "not dying."
Secondly, is it not glar
ingly obvious that hunting is a
waste of life? I have accepted
that each species is born with a
tool for survival: a lion's is her
powerful arms and chest, an
alligator's is his massive jaw,
and a human's is his
_> ability to make
VIIV i weapons.
_^U If However,
_ClLV except
_^miwm

mans, ^^^^_M_*
a 1 1 m j_^
these _j_£_r
tools ex- _~ ist with
the sole purpose of
aiding in the species' quest
to live and reproduce.
Consequently, I am skep
tical of those humans who
claim that they could not live
without the stuffed upper body
of a deer perched over their
mantles. Even in those incred
ibly boring fishing shows we all
seem to have briefly watched
at some point, they throw back
the ones they don'tplan on eat
ing. But ask the majority of
gun-toting hunters and they'll
probably tell you that at some
point they've killed an animal
then done nothing but inspect
their prize.
I was flipping through the
channels recently and unfortu
nately caught a deer hunt on
TNN. The one camouflaged
idiot fires a shot and drops a
deer as it was eating leaves off
a small bush, then the other
moron pats him emphatically

on the back and says, "Good
shot, man! Good shot!" They
then both jog up to the bloody
carcass and inspect it thor
oughly and the shooter says,
"Oh, wow, look at its mass!"
If he wanted to appreciate the
beauty of it, why didn't he save
the money on his rifle, buy a
strong set of binoculars, and
look at it?
Some hunters claim that
they're doing the overpopu
lated deer a favor by not let
ting them starve, but I question
if they even havethemselves
convinced with that one.
Firstly, I highly doubt that most
hunters can tell from 100 yards
whether the particular deer
they are about to shoot is
malnourished or not.
|p4_|: And secondly, it is
high time that hu
mans realize that it is
not our noble duty to al
ter the way mother nature
works.

If deer are going to
starve, it is for a reason, prob
ably because the strong ones
are surviving and strengthening
their species. Life has prevailed
for the past (4.5) billion years,
and it makes me very nervous
to think that its course is being
determined by some guy who
pins his NRA card to his shirt
and douses himself in fox urine.
Until the bears and ducks
and elephants learn to equip
themselves with motion-cen
sored lasers and we start see
ing hunters go home maimed,
mangled, or worse, hunting for
the sake of satisfying manly
urges should and will be
shunned by the sensible. But

Update: East Timor

Portugal pulled out of
East Timor in 1975, ending
400 years of colonial control.
Indonesian armed forces(TNI)
promptly invaded, claiming
East Timor as the country's
27th province. Since then the
conflict has claimed an esti-

Follow-

lives. The UN

ing protests
and riots
spurred by the
economic tur
moil of recent
years, Indone
sian President
Suharto stepped down.
His deputy B.J.
Habibie took his

place, prom
ising national elections this
year. In January, Habibie an
nounced that East Timor would
be allowed to vote on its future
status with Indonesia.
After being postponed
repeatedly, the referendum was
held on August 30. "Official"
recognition, however, must
wait for the Indonesian legis
lature to approve the referen
dum (scheduled for Novem
ber). The choice facing the East
Timorese was either
autonomony within Indonesia,
or complete independence for
their province. Despite terror
attacks on the part of militias,
over 98 percent of the popula
tion came out to vote. The vio
lence began in earnest after the
UN announced the results a
few days later.

With news that the inde
pendence vote had succeeded,
pro-Indonesian forces
launched a terror campaign.
Hundreds, perhaps thousands,
of East Timorese are dead and

hundreds of thousands dis
placed, but exact figures remain
uncertain as journalists and UN
observers along with East
Timorese have fled in fear for
their lives. The Timorese capi
tal of Dili has been burned and
looted. The TNI has been ac
cused of taking no action to pre
vent the attacks and even di
rectly participating in some.
A multinational peace
keeping-force arrived at the
East Timor capital of Dili on
Monday, after In¬

donesian Presi
dent B.J. Habibie
announced that
he would accept
UN peacekeepers
in East Timor last
week. The 8,000
troop force is pre
dominantly Aus
tralian. The U.S. is
contributing no
combat troops but
is helping with lo
gistics and trans¬

port.
Indonesia is the fourth
most populous nation on earth.
Its population is predominantly
Muslim, although the majority
East Timorese are Christian.
Priests and nuns have been
among those targeted in recent
violence. The U.S. has sold mil
lions of dollars worth of arms
to Indonesia in the past, al
though there is currently an
embargo of light arms to the
country. U.S. M-16 rifles have
been used to commit some of
the atrocities.
All nations should stop all
non-humanitarian aid to Indo
nesia until leaders of the para
military groups are disarmed
and an investigation into the
TNI's complicity is launched.
An impartial fact finding
commision should be estab
lished and an international
criminal tribunal for crimes
against humanity set up if the
facts warrant one.

this Side of Cynicism
Gettysburg's Bullet to bite the dust?

by i. a. isherwood
Social Commentator
This week at Student Sen
ate our very own mascot "Billy
Bullet" came under fire. For

some time now, the
use of our precious
mascot has been dis
couraged because of
the violent conno
tations that a bul
let might represent
to those outside
our campus com
munity. _^
In this day mjk
and age it is not
appropriate for
such a politically
incorrect little mon

ster to exist, so it appears
that a change might be in or
der. A committee will investi
gate a possible alternative to
old Billy, so that we can use a
mascot on our playing fields
who is more positive, more
friendly, and less phallic. And

so another mascot (one much
less offensive than the word
"redskin") will be sucked in
and destroyed by the politically
correct supersensitive 90s, only
to be replaced with something
friendly and peace-

While

_L _^^
_^^ r e -
searching this ar
ticle, I talked with the people
around me about possible alter
natives to the "Bullet." This is
not the first mascot fight that I
personally have been involved
with (my high school teams
were known as the "Fighting

Quakers"), yet it is the most
personal. Our "Bullet" is not
the most pleasing thing to look
at - in fact it is just ridiculous,
but it is a part of our heritage.
On these very grounds
men fell wounded and died as
a result of gunshot wounds.

he

expression "bite the
bullet" (although
•^ historically in
¦ w « accurate) is an
j** _^ expression we
associate with
suffering.
I Thus, every loss

we sustain is a
tribute to that suffering
and a reason to bite down on
our little Billy to kill the pain

of defeat. Aside from the
rhetoric of the last statement,
the bullet is a symbol of the
battlefield, of Gettysburg, and
"Bullets" looks really cool on
sweatshirts (and the back of
shorts).
When I debated this issue
with some friends, some, new
ideas for mascots emerged.

Even as we sit here today, there
is a subversive underground
movement to change the name
of the mascot to the "Yaks," or
even the "Fighting Water Buf
falo." Maybe these are the
types of images we want to rep
resent ourselves.
Another comment was
that we should be renamed the
Gettysburg "Monuments," but
the person in the costume
might not be as lively as one
would expect. Another cam
paign is underway for us to
become the "Apples" so that
when we get demolished on the
field, the resulting applesauce
can be brought to us by the
_Musselman Foundation.
I see no real need to
change the mascot because,
frankly, it is not all that offen
sive. It is a bullet, an angry one
at that, and it is something
unique in the world of stupid
lions or birds prancing around

Incoming Zhouyhts As time goes by

byJeph McGowan
First Year Columnist
I have a unique vantage
point here in my room. I face
the window, and I can see the
leaves begin to change colors.
I can remember when I first
visited — the leaves were doing
the same thing. The reds and
yellows and browns and or
anges lit up the countryside on
the drive up.
Just looking reminds me
of the days in elementary
school when I would stare out
the window at the woods be
hind the school and wish I was
at recess or going home. Play
ing in the leaves, all my troubles
kind of slipped away for a time,
the crisp autumn air somehow
became more-or-Iess therapeu¬

tic. The leaves remind me of
the nature of life. Life doesn't
slow down for you so you can
stay a kid in elementary school
on a cool autumn afternoon.
Time won't hold still so you can
enjoy the leaf pile Olympics for
a little longer before dinner.
Years pass by while you worry
about what you're going to do
with your life, while you won
der about what makes clouds
dance like they do, while you
relax on a hammock and enjoy
the breeze.
In an instant you move
from fifth-grader to high
school senior to college fresh
man, without realizing all the
things that have passed by and
been done with while you
stood in line waiting for your
waffle to cook. Every trial and

tribulation, every happy mo
ment and every heartbreaking
scene, only a shadow of what
just flew by.
There's something about
chicken rice soup when you
add corn to it, something just
not quite right. It's like having
grilled ham and cheese with
tomato soup. Agreed, it's
grilled cheese and tomato soup
(by far the best thing in recent
history) but the ham just
doesn't quite do it. Sometimes,
there's a line that shouldn't be
crossed; there's a point where
the great additions you can
think of really don't do any
thing for the project.
There seems to be a prob
lem with the sky. If a plumber
is who you tell, maybe we
should call one. It seems as
though the air above us here in

humble Gettysburg is leaking
more and more lately. This
may be attributed to some
other hole in the ozone layer,
or someone might have left the
tub filling while they went to
wait in line for food at servo.
Either way, something should
be done.
So now what? What do
you do while the days just fly
by? You enjoy the breeze run
ning through the tall grass. You
stop while walking past a gar
den, and take a good look at it.
When a butterfly happens by,
don't turn a shoulder to it.
Smile at people, and really
mean it. If things are going to
slip though the cracks of your
life, then the memories may as
well be of some substance, and
not just some incomprehensible
blur.

Un
idealizing Miss
America

by Rachel Hanson
Contributing Writer
Last week the executive
board of the Miss America Or
ganization announced that a
loosening of their contestant
criteria had been passed. On
the very same day, the pageant's
chief executive changed his
mind and said that they would
be returning to the original set
of rules.
In the past, a woman who
wished to be a contestant in the
Miss America Pageant had to
sign a form saying that she had
never been pregnant and never
been married. Last week's an
nouncement said that this
wording would be changed to
"I am unmarried" and "I am
not pregnant and I am not the
natural or adoptive parent of
any child."

The director decided not
to implement this change after
great backlash from pageant di
rectors at the state level, cur
rent contestants and former
winners of the pageant. It was
said that Miss America has al
ways had high morals and been
a role model to young girls, and
that allowing women who have
had abortions and divorces in
the past to compete would tar
nish the rhinestone crown.
The leaders of beauty
pageants have a lot of nerve
telling the women of the United
States how they should act.
This is an institution that re
wards women for being beau
ties and prancing around in
swimsuits and evening gowns;
for practicing the fine art of
pleasing men.
Beauty pageants have
tried to become more politi
cally correct and attempted to
appease the throngs of right
fully angered feminists by mak

Would the real conservative please step forward?
Bush's nomination could spell defeat for the GOP

by Justin Marple
Contributing Writer

George W. Bush and his
"compassionate conservatism"
is a cruel slap in the face of true
conservatives. Returning
power to the people is inher
ently compassionate because
they can help themselves and
each other. Conservatives be
lieve in religious charities and
other private organizations as
opposed to big-brother govern
ment. This closet liberal clearly
trusts bureaucrats instead of the
people.
Anyone who is the nomi
nee must have a firm founda
tion of conservative principles
or the entire Republican Party
will suffer. Principled conser
vatives vote more often than
the moderates in the party. But
if Bush does not motivate the
activists, they may leave the
presidential choice blank, file
a protest vote, or not vote at
all. Some believe that it is the
right-wing that harms the Re
publican Party because their
devotion is to their deeply held
convictions and not the parry.
While the right-wine can

bring down the Republican
Parry, it is only when Republi
cans offer real choice in ideas
and philosophy that they win.
The probable Republican
nominee is seen as a carbon
copy of the socialist Democrats
obviously without genuine con
servative positions. The quasi
sociahst establishment faction
in the GOP will not advocate
necessary reforms because they
are afraid of the liberal media.
This reluctance attempts to
avoid offending these liberal
elitists who will attempt to de
stroy those candidates who
hold opinions different from

their own.
Closer inspection of
Bush's record continues to
show that he is no conservative,
which explains his warm and
fuzzy embrace by the socialist
press. Fellow left-wingers, in
cluding many liberal members
of the Democratic Party, sup
ported Bush overwhelmingly
for reelection. They needed a
strong ally in the governor's
mansion to promote their tax
and spend agenda. They got
what they wanted, Bush raised
spending by about 36 percent,
which is more than Clinton and
"Algore" managed. Further¬

more, his "tax reform" bill
added some 75 new taxes for
the citizens of Texas. The is
sues that a politician cares
about most display their ideo
logical inclinations, but no one
knows what Bush wants. Three
of his few public positions
should alarm conservatives ev
erywhere: continuing Most
Favored Nation status and the
coddling of oppressive Com
munist China, hijacking educa
tion from local control, and
advancing reverse racism by his
affirmative action sellout.
If a "Chntonesque" Bush,
complete with Clintonian

policy and spin, wins the nomi
nation, then the Republican
Party may disown the relatively
recent sacrifices and improve
ments from Barry Goldwater to
Ronald Reagan. Goldwater
reminded us that standing for
convictions is more important
than winning. Reagan proved
that a conservative alternative
to the establishment can ulti
mately triumph. I am afraid
that it may be time again to lose
in order for us to win. Prin
cipled defeat may be the only
Wdy we can become that shin
ing city on the hill envisioned
in the Reaean Revolution.

Miss America

ing the contestants, who could
also be called "animals on dis
play," wear one-piece swim
suits rather than bikinis. There
are also the ever-stimulating
question and answer sessions,
where these women demon
strate just how progressive they
really are, as if no one has ever
advocated world peace before.
Perhaps rather than al
lowing women without a "per
fect" past to compete, and
therefore jeopardize the mor
als of our children, they should
change the current format to
truly reflect the women of this
country between the ages of 17
and 24, namely advocating
honesty to the children of
America. Let us all imagine
what this would look like.

The women would be
somewhere between sizes eight
and twelve, not two or four.
One in four contestants would
have an eating disorder. The
women would have severe psy
chological and self-esteem is
sues as a result of society en
forced expectations. They
would be exhausted from
studying so much just to prove
that they really are as smart as
their male counterparts. Yet,
they would be studying to en
ter professions that would pay
them only 75 cents for every
dollar that a man' earns. Oh,
and they would most likely ei
ther have had or known some
one who has had a very per
sonal (and difficult) experience
with abortion.

Mascot

-continued from page 13 -
dugouts. It is a symbol of
our town and the history

ashamed because little Billy
has phallic connotations; we
already have a large "thing"

mascot that counts - it's
what you do with it.

After 2-0 week,
Volleyball eyes arch rival
Juniata

by Kristin Seaks
Staff Writer
Gettysburg's volleyball
team began conference play
with two matches on Saturday
against Swarthmore and Bryn
Mawr. The Bullets played
strong and did not lose a single
game in either of their matches.
"We had a really disap
pointing loss to Frostburg [last
week]," said Head Coach Kim
Kelly, "so we wanted to pick it
up again."
The Lady Bullets suc
ceeded in doing this, with
scores of 15-8, 15-11, and 15
6 to defeat Bryn Mawr 3-0.
They sustained their momen
tum through the next match
versus Swarthmore.
Gettysburg won this
match 3-0 once again (15-1,
15-11, 15-4) to improve their
Centennial Conference record
to 2-0.

The Bullets experimented
with a new lineup in Saturday's
matches, and are hoping to

continue using this lineup. In
these matches, the team was
able to play all of its players.
Working as a team al
lowed the Bullets to dominate
their first two conference
matches. Gettysburg is working
to continue their success on the

co. Freshman Lauren Boyd
put up 36 assists between both
matches and junior Nicole
Evans contributed 35.
Senior Jenna McKinsey
led the defense with 12 digs,
while senior Catherine Schott
hit .645, putting down 23 kills
in the matches.
Schott was named the
Conference's Player of the
Week, for the second straight
week, after leading the Bullets
to a pair of Centennial wins
over Bryn Mawr and
Swarthmore. She had 48 kills
and hit .435 in three matches
last week.
The Lady Bullets enter
tournament play this weekend
at Millersville University. The
tournament is comprised of
mostly Division II schools, a

few of which are nationally
ranked.
Gettysburg's pool con
sists of Lock Haven, Slippery
Rock, and Shippenburg.
The team will return
from the tournament this
weekend to prepare for a busy
week. Sophomore Christina
Giles expressed the thought on
all the players' minds when she
said, "Next week is a big
week."
Their big week begins
Tuesday, as the Lady Bullets
host arch rival Juniata in a
battle of nationally ranked
teams.
Although this is not con
ference play, this could be a
clash of the top two teams in
the Mid-Atlantic region. The
team is hoping for a big crowd
to cheer them on.
The Gettysburg Volley
ball team will return to confer
ence play Wednesday as they
travel to Haverford.

The Lady Bullets are cur
rently 2-0 in the conference
and 10-3 overall.

flnother ujeek of wins keeps
G-'Burg field hockey on top

by Lisa Beideman
Staff Writer
The Gettysburg women's
field hockey team had another
impressive week marked by
two big wins. Last Saturday
they traveled to Catholic to
play in a non-conference match
up. Senior Laura DeSario
started off the scoring in the
first half off of an assist from
junior Jenni White. A second
unanswered goal was fired in
by sophomore forward Amy
Bois. The score at half time
stood at 2-0.
Senior Steph Fisher
sealed the win in the second
half with her sixth goal of the
season as the Bullets improved
to 3-0.

Gettysburg's goalie, jun
ior Maureen Giese, had four
saves which was enough for the
shoutout.
On Tuesday, Messiah
came to Memorial Field to
meet the Bullets in a head-to
head non-conference contest.
To say the least, there was
never a dull moment in this
hard fought contest.

Despite the cold, driv
ing rain Gettysburg ended the
game with a 4-3 victory, their
sixth of the season.
After a 1-0 deficit at the
begining of the game, senior
Amy Stambaugh and junior
Tabitha Gary each scored goals
within an 11-minute span, put
tine the Bullets on top 2-1.

However, before the half
time whistle, Messiah answered
back with a goal to tie the con
test. Ten minutes into the sec
ond half, Fisher found the cage
on a penalty stroke. Gettys
burg led it 3-2, but not for long.
In less than 3 minutes a Mes
siah forward snuck one by

Giese to again tie the game at
3-3. It didn't take Gettysburg
long to answer that call how
ever, in 30 seconds Fisher
slammed her second goal of the
game into the Messiah cage
with the game winning shot.
Junior midfielder
¦ Whitney "Walsh had an explo¬

sive game in the midfield keep
ing the Bullets on attack and
owning the ball in her defen
sive game.
Sophomore Amy
Centanni and senior Tara
Chipko also had impressive
games on defense.
This win over Messiah
marks only the second time in
a fourteen year series that Get
tysburg has come out the vic
tor. These two wins also im
proves Gettysburg's record to
6-0 overall, 2-0 in the Centen
nial Conference.
"I think we played a team
game and played 'our' game,"
said Walsh. "Our intensity was
there from the start and con
tinued throughout the game."
She ended by adding, "It
felt really good to win against
a team like Messiah."
And with a lot of skill and
plenty of preparation, the
women's field hockey team will
be beating teams of Messiah's
caliber all season long.

This afternoon the Bullets
face Muhlenberg at 4 p.m. on
Memorial Field and on Satur
day they host Bryn Mawr at
noon. Both are Centennial
Conference matchups.

tending. Sophomore Erin
Hayden posted her first career
shutout. She had four saves, de
spite slippery, rainy conditions.
"Erin has made a very
commendable effort at a new
position," said Wawrousek.
"The team made it easy for me;"
said Hayden.
Saturday, the Lady Bullets
traveled to Elmira_, N.Y., to take
on what Wawrousek called a
very average team. The game
ended in a 1-1 tie, with
Gettysburg's lone goal coming
from a shot by Lauren Frankford
from 30 yards out.
Once again, the Bullets
dominated play, firing 66 shots,
compared to Elmira's four goal
attempts. Unfortunately, the
team's decision-making was not
up to par.

They are working on
their shot angles and their pa
tience in shooting, which will
hopefully bring about a change
in offensive success. Despite
the lack in scoring, Wawrousek
has high confidence in his team.
"We're playing the best soccer
we've ever played right now,"
he said.
Wawrousek believes the
team knows they're a quality
group, capable of making suc
cess happen. With some work
on weaknesses, he says the Bul
lets "can be a dangerous team."
A large factor in the
team's potential is their depth.
Sophomore Leslie Sloper, a re
serve player, has shown tre
mendous improvement re
cently.
She has played a variety

of positions in the back and at
midfield, and has done a great
job everwhere. Sloper's reward
came in the form of a start
against Ehzabethtown Tuesday
Junior Jill Piekarski has
also displayed quality perfor
mances, with exceptional dis
tribution at midfield.
The Bullets came up short
against Eluabethtown on Tues
day afternoon. The women
fought hard in the wind and
rain, but couldn't put it to
gether after their first goal.
Senior Lauren Morrell
scored the first goal of the game
in the 34th minute.
However, E-town re
sponded with a breakaway that
split the Bullet defense, and
landed one in the back of the
net with less than a minute re¬

maining in the first half.
Then, in the last three
minutes of the game, E-town
came through once more,
punching in a goal from a mis
handled cross, to win 2-1.
Upcoming games in the Lady
Bullets' schedule are: Satur
day, at home against Washing
ton, a new conference team,
and Wednesday night at
Muhlenberg.
The game at
Muhlenberg will be a tough
match for Gettysburg, but
Wawrousek and the Bullets
feel strong and confident
about then skills and their
winning capability.
"We're doing everything
we need to do, except score,"
said Frankford. "Once we
start finishing, there will be no
stopping us."

Football falls to 0-3
Paul Smith rewrites the record books again

Times Sports Writer
From Gettysburg Times
Presswire
Not since 1979, head
coach Barry Streeter's second
year at Gettysburg College, has
the Bullet football team started
a season 0-3.
That is until Saturday,
when it lost to defending Cen
tennial Conference champion
West-ern Maryland, 44-0.
It was the first time the
Bullets were shut out since a
41-0 defeat in 1927.
In the three games played
so far in 1999, the Bullets (0
3) have been outscored 129-34.
In addition, dating back to last
year, they have dropped nine
of their last 10 games. But
through it all, the Bullets push

on. They came out with fire
in their eyes Saturday. On the

game's first series, they held
Western Maryland to three
plays and a punt, which, due

to a bad snap, never got off. Gieen Terror 1-yard line. But
And on their ensuing diive, the in the snap of a ball, things
Bullets went 31 yards to the went south as Dan Evanko's
_^ .._vV _os x-Y _^ .:_^ _A\_S>\^:v_% :^\_xCi 18-yard field

goal sailed
wide and the
Bullets were
left empty
handed.
"That
really hurt
us," said
Streeter of the
missed field
goal. " Our
kids had a
great week of
practice and
they knew
they would
have to come
out and play
with some
emotion and I
think they re
sponded well
early." Later in
the first pe
riod, the

Green Terror blocked a Gettys
burg punt, which led to the first
score of the contest, a five-yard
run by quarterback Ron
Sermarmi.
For the second straight
week, Bullet fullback Paul
Smith set a record only to see
his team lose. Saturday against
the Green Terror, the senior
fullback became the Centennial
Conference's all-time leader in
all-purpose (7,077) and kickoff
return (1,869) yardage. He
was named to the Centennial
Conference Weekly Honor
Roll for his performance.
Gettysburg was held to
just 190 total yards and were
only able to gain 48 yards via
the air.
Senior DB Chris Lunardi
had seven tackles, including
two for losses, to lead the de
fensive effort.

Sophomore Ryan Moore
had six solo tackles and a sack,
which put him on the Centen
nial Conference Weekly Honor
Roll.

The past week has been a
positive one for the women's
soccer team.
They have improved
their record to 2-5-1 overall
and 1-0 in the Centennial Con
ference, following a win over
Franklin & Marshall last
Wednesday, a tie with Elmna
Saturday, and defeat by
Elizabethtown Tuesday.
The Bullets saw victory in
their conference opener versus
Franklin &C Marshall, in a 1-0
win that came in overtime.
F & M, with new talent
this year, showed a vast im
provement over last year, but

Defensively, Gettysburg

led by its four key backs, senior

the run of play and placed a lot
of pressure on their opponents;
however they were unable to
finish up the plays with the ball

The game remained
scoreless until the 94th minute,
when sophomore Abi Reaser
came off the bench to score the
game winning goal, the first of
her career.
She was assisted by
sophomore Maureen
O'Donnell, who crossed the
ball from the outside.
Wawrousek was very
pleased with the quality he saw
in the overtime play by six re
serves. He is working on vary

ers to create more scoring op
portunities.
Another highlight of the
win over F & M was the goal

Women victorious, men runners-up at Forest Festival

Sophomore Kristin Rob
erts, who finished first overall,
led the Gettysburg College
women's cross country team to
a first place finish at the Davis
and Elkins Forest Festival in
Elkins, West Virginia.
The men, who ran with
out their number one runner,
junior Jonathon Qatlett, fin
ished second as junior Jason
Rose paced the Bullets with a
ninth-place finish.
The Forest Festival,
hosted by Davis and Elkins
College, is the most unique and
challenging course that Gettys
burg will see this year.
Incorporating steep
climbs, water hazards, and un
usually rugged terrain, both the
women's and men's perfor
mances were noteworthy.
Roberfs' time of 21:13

gave her a more than 20 sec
ond edge over her closest com
petitor. Also running well for
the women were sophomores
Megan McGolrick and Lauren
Davis, who finished Jth and
6th overall, with times of 22:10
and 22:22 respectively.
Others who placed in
cluded juniors Kim Heimerl

Janel Farrel (34 and 23:57),
junior Kelley Lord (35 and
23:58), and freshman Allison
Small (43 and 24:25).
"The women's team has
been working on 'packing it up'
all season and the top four were
finally able to do so on Satur
day," said senior captain
Chesha Miller.
"We need to continue to
close the gap throughout the
whole team."

Golden Cleat to the entire
team. The Golden Cleat is nor
mally given to an individual
who has an outstanding perfor
mance. The idea of the team's
performance and experience
was a recurring one.
"It was an exciting mo
ment to win as a team - espe¬

cially on such a difficult
course," said Roberts. "It was
also important for everyone to
have fun."
The men proved to be
just as adept at handling the
extreme conditions, as they fin
ished second overall to regional
foe Frostburg State.

"On this course," said
Gary, "it's like a bai-room
brawl. You just have to keep

No one personified this
better than sophomore James

Though the difficulty of
the course makes times and
places somewhat meaningless,
Head Coach Robert Condon
explained why this race was so
important to the women.
"The women had a lot of
ailments last year, and were

Decker, whose return to racing
after a lengthy abscence netted
him the Golden Cleat award.
The men's overall perfor
mance was excellent, but no
table abscences by both Gettys
burg runners and others left
Condon pondering the future.
"We had some guys out,
and some of the other teams

Miller.
"This win gives us confi
dence in our ability to be a
major force in the conference
which is especially important
for us to realize before we face
F&M and Dickinson next
week."

Men s Soccer turns in another stellar performance
Bullets click offensively as they improve to 2-0 in the conference, 5-1-1 overall

by Robin Roger
Staff Writer
Last Saturday the
men's soccer team
turned in another stellar
performance with their
win against Washington
College.
The final score was
4-1, with all four goals
scored.by senior captain
Chris Pryor. This win,
the Bullets' first confer
ence win of the season,
adds to the team's repu
tation as a serious con
tender for the confer
ence title.
Coach Wright was
pleased with Pryor's
performance, as well as
with that of the rest of
the team. He said Pryor
had a career day, and the
team "played very well
and created many scor
ing opportunities."

The Bullets'
outshot their opponents

Senior captain Chris Pryor, who was named Centennial Conference Player of the Week, challenges
was Wesley opponent for the ball.

22-8. "Everything
clicking offensively
fensive game," s;

We had a great of- Outerbndge.
d senior Adam Assists were made by Jerem

Shapiro, sophomore Michael
McLaughlm, and senior captains Jesse
Flynn, and Jason Vishio.
Although Pryor shined, everyone
contributed to the win. Pryor said, "It
was the best offense we've played all sea
son, combination-wise."
He also gave credit to the defense
and the two goalkeepers. Together keep
ers Nick La Porta and Steve Kopp only
had to make three saves.
Pryor was named Centennial Con
ference Player of the Week for his four
goal performance. He became just the
eighth player in conference history to
reach the 40-goal plateau for his career.
Yesterday Gettysburg beat an infe
rior Wesley team 3-0, bringing the tally
up to 5-1-1 for the season and 2-0 in the

conference.
The Bullets domi
nated most of the game,
with little opposition. In
fact, Wesley had few
scoring opportunities,
keeping the pressure
light on La Porta and the
Bullets' defense.
The 25th-ranked
Bullets outshot the Wol
verines, 18-4.
There were only a
few suspenseful mo
ments when the opposi
tion managed to draw
fouls close to the goal.
These opportunities
came to no avail, how
ever, as the Bullets
posted their third shut
out of the season.
Sophomore
Michael McLaughlm
scored the first two goals,
one in each half. The
first goal was a direct
kick.

The other ball was
deflected off of freshman
James Miller's throw-in
and was ripped into the
back of the net by

a

McLaughlm. Wesley s keeper had no
chance of reaching either of the well
placed strikes.
The third and final goal came in
the last couple minutes of the game.
Outerbndge flicked the ball to
Pryor who was in the box. Pryor
quickly one-timed it into the back of
the net. The Bullets had been in close
scoring range for quite some time and
finally managed to put it away.
With little competition, the Bul
lets played an impressive, if not excit
ing, game.
These wins surely put the team
into tne position which they would
like to be in. It appears the gaps are
closing and things are quickly coming
togethei for the team.
