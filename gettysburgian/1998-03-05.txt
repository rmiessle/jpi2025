Predicting the future

Commission reveals findings

by Rebecca Babbitt
Staff Reporter The Commission on the Future of Gettysburg College
met Saturday afternoon to present the preliminary findings of
their year-long examination of the College's academic and co
curricular programs. The final presentation will be made on
Monday and reviewed by the Board of Trustees at their next
two meetings in May and September.
The Commission, a group of 367 alumni, parents and
friends of the college, volunteered one year ago to examine
and plan for the future of the College. They formed nine task
forces to study:
Culture and the Arts
Collaborative Learning and Teamwork
Economics and Management
Enhancing Residential Life
Excellence in the Sciences and Psychology
Information Technology
Public Affairs and Public Service
Student Recruitment and Retention
Supporting Student Success
Together they proposed 186 recommendations plus sub
- points to be considered by the Board of Trustees.
*_L The major themes of the recommendations were presented
over the weekend. These themes included active teaching and
learning, creating a vibrant campus climate, working on global
I outreach, recruiting a diverse community, creating distinctive
programs, and improving technology and facilities. More pre
cise goals were presented in a formal report issued on Monday.
I President of the College, Gordon Haaland said the Com
mission presented "a truly impressive effort." Paul Odell,
I Chairman of the Board of Trustees told the 170 assembled
I members of the Commission "you've done a first class job."
I "I had high expectations, but they exceeded them," said
B President of the Commission, Jim Brenemann. "This will have
I a greater impact than anything else I've been involved in with
the College."
H Some of the recommendations included student-designed
_II social activities and establishing a Center for Leadership and
U Public Affairs. Formal recommendations call for 32 new or

Redding wins presidency

Zalewski
by Laura Root
Staff Reporter After two different elec
tions, it has been decided that
Earl Redding will be the Student
Senate president for the 1998
1999 school year.
Last Monday, a runoff
election for the presidency was
held between Redding and Sara
Zalewski.
According to the Student
Senate Constitution, a person
running for an executive office
must capture fifty percent of all
student votes.
None of the three candi
dates for the position, John
Dunlap, Earl Redding, nor Sara
Zalewski could do so. A runoff
election was then held between
the top two vote-getters,
Redding and Zalewski.

Although there has not
been a runoff election in several
years, both Redding and
Zalewski thought that there

defeated in special ru
might be one this year.
"Having three candidates
for president splits the votes,"
said Redding.
Zalewski commented that,
"This year's Vice President, Val
Katzmar, who is in charge of
elections made sure that every
thing followed the Senate Con
stitution."
During the extra days of
campaigning that the candidates
received, both Redding and
Zalewski kept working hard to
_increase the amount of enthusi
asm on campus for elections.
Zalewski replaced signs,
wrote messages on the sidewalks,
and emailed to publicize the
event. Redding spoke up about
the elections and encouraged as
many people as he could to par
ticipate.
The candidates were not
happy with this extra election.
Zalewski thinks that it placed too
much pressure on both candi-

noff election
dates. "It's just four more days
of stress," she said.
One of Redding's goals
while in office is to reform the
Senate constitution. He hopes
to change the election process
and get nd of the runoff policy.
"Congratulations to all
other executive position holders
and thanks to everyone who sup
ported me. We have some big
shoes to fill," he concluded.
Redding replaces sitting
president Abby Rodgers who
graduates this spring.

"The Only Woman in the
Room" is a personal and vivid
account of Gordon's life in
Europe, prewar Japan, and the

United States. As the daughter
of a renowned Russian pianist
Leo Sirota, Beate Gordon grew
up in the cosmopolitan world
of the concert tour, and settled
in Japan in the 1930's.
During World War II, her
parents remained in Tokyo,
while Gordon lived in the
United States, attending Mills
College and monitoring Tokyo
Radio in five languages for the
government.
Gordon later returned to
Tokyo to work in General
MacArthur's headquarters,
where she singledhandedly for

ing equal rights for women in
Japan's new constitution.
On returning to the
United States in 1947, Gordon

from all over Asia to the United
States. In recognition of her
cross-cultural achievement, she

Other themes suggested imple
menting experiential learning,
increasing alumni involvement,
and accommodating the grow
ing residential needs of the Col
lege by constructing a new resi
dential facility.
"We will respond to ev
ery recommendation," said
Odell. "But we cannot imple
ment every idea."
"This is a work in
progress," Odell said. "This is
just another stage, it doesn't
end here," said Brenemann.
The theme of the Com
mission now is, "There can be
no bystanders in the future of

Future
Gettysburg College." The Col
lege hopes the Commission
will continue to play an active
role in their strategic Planning
and that others will volunteer.
Strategic Planning was pro
posed by Haaland in 1995 to
chart a course for the College's
future. The Commission and
its recommendations are part
of that plan.
"The commission mem
bers have provided thoughtful
and insightful perspectives on
areas of vital importance to the
future of the College, and their
recommendations will provide
significant impetus to the
Board of Trustees as

- continued _jmmjionl page -
Gettysburg College moves for
ward in its strategic planning
process," said Brenemann
But Haaland acknowl
edged that the recommenda
tions neglected History, Writing
and Civil War Studies.
The Commission also did
not look specifically at many of
the issues currently plaguing the
College. Although there has
been some student protest
about the tenure process, and
the College was sued for dis
crimination in tenure last se
mester, the Commission did not
deal with tenure as a separate
issue. They examined the "im
portant roles for faculty in ad¬
i — - _j -------

vising and collaborative learn
ing," said Brenneman and
looked for ways to recognize
and reward professors.
The issue of Greek Life
and the presence of Sororities
and Fraternities on campus wa
dealt with as a piece of larger
areas, mainly "residential life
and social opportunities," said
Brenemann.
Although the Commis
sion expressed an interest in
global outreach, it did not get
involved in the debate of inter
national students transferring
their college financial aid to
study abroad, a heated topic of
debate among students for over
— qj

three years. The President's
office is evaluating the process,
though it was not part of the
Commission.
Still, the overall attitude
about the Commission report
is positive. "The successful
completion of the Commission
on the Future of Gettysburg
College will help the Board of
Trustees develop a clear action
plan for review and eventual
implementation for the benefit
of our current and future stu
dents, especially in relation to
programs curriculum and fos
tering of an active and dynamic
learning environment," said
Haaland.

Irish music comes to Gettysburg

by Cara Masucci
Staff Reporter Cultural diversity within
the college seems to be the only
thing that people are talking
about these days. The college
faculty and many students wish
to see more diversity in all as
pects of college life. One group
on campus which is adding to
diversity is the band the War
rior Poets. For senior band
member Paul "Hutch"
Hutchinson and sophomores
Jay Spiese and Ian Isherwood,
the group is more than just mu
sic; it is a way of life.
To an unaware listener it
would seem as though the band
has been together forever.
Their one-liners and unique in
terpretations of traditional Irish
folk music are so well put-to
gether it is hard to believe the
band was formed only a little
over three months ago.

According to band man
ager Isherwood, the idea of
starting an Irish band just
popped into his head one day.
Speaking on the telephone with
classmate and friend Spiese
over Thanksgiving break, the
two decided to approach
Hutchinson about becoming a
member of the infant band.
According the three men, this
was what they refer to as "hare
brained scheme number one!"
Approaching Hutchinson
was a unique experience, ac
cording to Isherwood, because

upon the mention of the idea,
Hutchinson pulled out an Irish
whistle. Isherwood states in ref
erence to Hutchinson_'s whistle
playing, "He played like sweet
music." It appeared as though
the two men had been thinking
along the same lines. When
Spiese commented that he had
often thought about it too, it
became clear these guys be
longed together in a band. It
was only natural the band
should play Irish music because
all the guys grew up on it. From
that point on, the alliance was
cemented.
As soon as the band was

formed, it appeared as though
they had a mission: the search
for material and a place to play
it. According to Isherwood, he
had been in two previous
bands, Spiese has been singing
since he was born, and as for
Hutchinson, well, he sings in
the shower.
According to
Hutchinson, all of the songs are
traditional Irish folk songs that
the band has arranged them¬

selves. The group definitely
gives the songs a unique twist,
with one-iiners added on in the
pauses of the music and the
good-natured ribbing between
band members and their friends
in the audience during the per
formance.
As soon as the group had
a couple of songs arranged,
they decided they needed to
make themselves known. At
the last moment, the group de
cided to play open mic during
Coffeehouse one evening early
this semester. The perfor
mance was greeted with much
enthusiasm and delight from
the audience. According to the
group, who later referred to it
as "harebrained scheme num
ber two," it worked.
The group gained confi¬

dence in their abilities and de
cided while hanging out one
night, that Buckley's, a local
Irish pub, needed a house band.
So was born "harebrained
scheme number three."
When they approached
Buckley's, the Warrior Poets
were received with a warm en
thusiasm for what they wanted
to do. According to Spiese,
"they were willing to help us
out and work on what was

needed." The group is not
ashamed to admit that they
were so overjoyed they actually
started hopping and jumping
around in excitement.
Spiese said that the bar set
them up for two big concerts
this semester. One is the pub's
year anniversary, and the other
was last Friday's Guinness
Toast.
One of the first problems
they encountered was the fact
that the guys had only three
songs arranged. Says
Isherwood, the group "worked
really hard creating material to
put this thing together, and we
did it!"
They also had to practice
their material somewhere. At
first the group practiced in
Hutchinson's apartment, but

due to the complaints of neigh
bors, were forced to practice in
Schmucker and the recording
booth at WZBT.
Practicing in the record
ing booth allows the guys to
critique their songs as they go
along. It also lead to "hare
brained scheme number four."
Isherwood says that the War
rior Poets would like to try
their hand at recording an al¬

bum. The band's lineup in
cludes songs like "Drunken
Sailor," "Whisky You're the
Devil," "Donald Where's Your
Trousers?," and the crowd
pleasing "Jolly Grog." When
ever the band plays the song, a
point comes where the entire
audience shouts "Arg!" The
band now gets requests for that
song all the time.
Daniel Jewitt, a friend of
the band's members and most
likely their biggest fan, com
ments that a lot of people re
ally love them. The audience
gets involved and starts danc
ing and singing along with the
group. He also states they have
developed their own "groupie"
following at Buckley's. The
group would also like to point

out, though, that Jewitt is the
official jigger of the Warrior Po
ets' world tour!
The guys are also im
pressed with the number of fac
ulty members who come to
their concerts. Rumor has it
that some even get up and jig.
The group has really
come together in the past few
weeks, playing at Buckley's,
Coffeehouse, and the talent
show two weeks ago. Accord
ing to the band, the competi
tion at the talent show was re
ally tough, but they had a very
enjoyable time. Because of
their rising popularity here on
campus, they are also setting up
a BYOB St. Patrick's Day show
with the college. In addition,
they will play at Buckley's twice
that day.
No matter how much the
group plays, they never cease
to amaze their fans. The band

can be found on stage in what
the group terms "the just-off
the-boat look." The guys de
cided to dress as their grandfa
thers would have, in typical
immigrant garb that includes
hats and boots. Since sequins
are not their style, the guys
opted for a more realistic late
nineteenth century look.
The Warrior Poets hope
to accomplish much more than
actually being a success on
stage. They hope they can help
restore the dying art of the
Irish-American folk song and
unite all Irish people under the
guise of music. According to
Spiese and Isherwood, "all Irish
people can appreciate our mu
sic." The men have a fantastic
time together, and enjoy the
good-natured ribbing they ex
change. All three guys are im
pressed with the people who
will come up to them and tell
them good luck on the day of a
concert, or that they played
well the night before.

Summed up in three
words by the Warrior Poets
themselves, the band is
"drinking, loving, and fight
ing." Interpret that however
you wish.

Gryz and bear it

by Jeremy Kuhar
Contributing Reporter
Walking into this office,
I notice a mountain bike sitting
quietly in the corner. As one
may expect, Dr. Joseph
Grzybowski is not only inter
ested in chemisty. He is the
type of person that his students
can trust and work with.
I asked Gryz whether
chemistry had been his first
choice in a career, whether he
had known since he was a child
that this was what he wanted
to base his life on. He replies,
with only a split-second of hesi
tation, "pretty much."
Grzybowski was born to
Joseph and Stella Grzybowski
in 1950. He grew up in Wilkes
Barre, Pennsylvania, and lived
in the same house until he
moved out to attend graduate
school at Case Western Re¬

serve. As a child his major out
of-the-house activity was his
involvement in Boy Scouts.
His interest in chemistry
began at an early age. His in¬

ability to explore chemistry as
a child led to an anticipation
of high school. He knew that
he would be able to take a
chemistry course in school, and
that he would enjoy it. He
maintained an A average in that

course.
At Kings College in
Wilkes-Barre, he enjoyed tak
ing many chemistry classes
from the simple introductory
level chemistry to the 300 and
400 level courses which would
help to define his career path.
At Kings College he
joined the college Glee Club,
among other things. While in
this choral group, he made
many normal friends as well as
some strange ones, and found
that bizarre things happen in
college.
His students may be dis
appointed to find out that one
of Gryz's friends from college
described him as "pretty tame."
Gryz has also been de
scribed by the same friends as
the type of person that could
always be counted on in a jam.
If one of his friends had too

much to drink, they could
count on him to provide a ride
home.
After he completed his
undergraduate degree,
Grzybowski continued on to
complete his doctorate at Case
Western Reserve University.
The completion of his Ph.D.
occurred in August of 1977.
Immediately following
his graduation from Case West
ern, he went on to work as a
postdoctoral research associate
in the Chemistry Department
of Ohio State University.
Gryz came to Gettysburg
in 1979 when he took the po
sition of Assistant Professor in
the Department of Chemistry.
When his tenure came in 1986,
he was advanced to the posi
tion of Associate Professor of
Chemistry.

In the short term scope of
his research, Grzybowski does
much of his work with his stu
dents in order to give them a
greater "hands-on" approach
to chemistry.
Now a full professor for
three years, Gryz is considered

to be a "very good teacher." He
knows that just as during his
college days, there are often
unexpected situations that arise
and cannot be avoided. For this
reason, he can be lenient to
wards deadlines, as long as that
privilege is not abused.
Grzybowski's most hated
tasks as a teacher are those as
sociated with grades and the
distribution of those marks. He
sometimes believes that grades
do not accurately reflect the
accomplishments of the indi
vidual.
Gryz tries to get to know
his students on a personal level;
one way in which he does this

is by playing sports. He espe
cially likes to play softball with
his research students. He goes
out drinking with those his stu
dents that are of legal age.
Outside of the school,
Gryz enjoys riding his bike, day
hiking and cross country skiing.
Grzybowski is the type of
professor that all students
would like to have. He takes
the time to answer your ques
tions, and will answer them
with patience.
He is a teacher that you
can come to know on a per
sonal level and form a relation
ship with that will last your
entire career.

In Case You Missed It

Gunman of Christmas present

by Eileen O'Donnell
Movie Columnist
Ah, Connecticut at
Christmas time. There's noth
ing like it: snow falling, a na
tivity scene in front of City
Hall, family coming home for
the holidays. Only for the fam
ily in The Ref, this Christmas is
going to be a bit different.
They're hostages.
After a botched robbery,
cat burglar Gus (Denis Leary)
is a man on the run. His part¬

ner has taken off in the getaway
car, and now he's a wanted man
stuck in Old Baybrook, CT.
What can he do but take a hos
tage until he finds a way out?
Gus carjacks Caroline and
Lloyd Chausser (Judy Davis
and Kevin Spacey), who have
just come from the marriage
counselor. Lloyd and Caroline
do nothing but argue with each
other, and Gus is quick to real
ize his mistake in choosing this
couple—he's hijacked the
couple from hell.

Gus needs to find a way
to get in touch with his part
ner so he can get out of Con
necticut and get on his way to
Jamaica with the loot. But that
won't be so easy. He needs a
place to hide out and to think

clearly, so
he had
Lloyd take
him to
their
house.
Mean
while,
Lloyd's
mother
and his
brother's
family are
one their
way down
from Bos
ton. To
top it all

off, Lloyd and Caroline's juve
nile delinquent son Jessie (Rob
ert Steinmiller, Jr.) is on his way
home from military school for
Christmas Eve dinner. Gus

could not have taken a more
dysfunctional family hostage.
Finally getting in touch
with his partner, Gus tells his
to commandeer a boat so they
can avoid the roadblocks and
get out. Now Gus has no

choice but to wait for the call
to say everything is clear. And
he can't afford to take any
more hostages. So Gus pre
tends to be Caroline and

Lloyd's marriage counselor, Dr.
Wong (his mother was Irish and
his father...wasn't).
This masquerade proves
to be hilarious as they try to
fool Lloyd's overbearing
mother, his pushy sister-in-law,

and his
wimpy brother.
The
Ref is a
very un
conven-tional
movie.
The ve
hicle for
Leary 's
dark,
cynical
comedy
should

be by
by by

not viewed

those who are offended
harsh or crude language. But
for those who are not offended
by it, Leary (Wag the Dog) is a
riot. Spacey (Midnight in the

Garden of Good and Evil) and
Davis (Deconstrcting Harry),
playing the dysfunctional mar
ried couple, fight as if they've
really been married for many
years. Christine Baranski (The
Birdcage) lends a great deal to
the movie as Lloyd's snotty sis
ter-in-law, and his audacious
mother is played by Glynis
Johns (While You Were Sleep
ing). Perhaps the funniest thing
about this movie is that it can

be seen as a social commentary
on family life. None of the
people in this family respect
each other, and it takes an irri
tated thief to put them back on
the right track.
Leary's maniacal ravings
will make you laugh, but if you
look deeper, you will be dis
turbed by what it is he is rav
ing about.
So if you're into comedy,
psychology, and sociology, rent
The Ref. You could probably
write a paper for class about it.

Reel Hits & Misses Only a Fool would miss this Kiss

by Dan Larkin and Mike Petro
Movie Columnists
Mike: Ever see a movie
preview of a romantic comedy
and think "Oh no, here conies
another one!" Well, you may
never have, but I certainly
have. Let's face it, there are
only so many basic movie for
mulas, and the romantic com
edy is one of them. The only
trouble with this format is that
it seems increasingly difficult to
come up with original and
quality movies.
However, the new movie
Kissing a Fool, which stars
David Schwimmer and Jason
Lee, delivers the goods. Kiss-

SUN CITY TANNING & GIFTS, etc.
153 Carlisle Street
Gettysburg, PA 17325
717-337-3338
New, Expanded Service!
We create and deliver gift baskets for men and women

ing a Fool is a funny, original,
and quite engaging movie.
Dan: Well, I'd hardly call
it original. There's only so
much one can do with these
romantic triangle things, and
the plots of them usually turn
out pretty much the same. But
with movies like this, original
ity doesn't matter as much as
how it works within the con
fines of the genre. And as far as
romantic comedies go, Kissing
a Fool is a pretty darn good one.
The premise of " this one
is really quite simple (as is the
case with most romantic com
edies). David Schwimmer
(Breast Men, The Pallbearer)
plays Max Abbit, a Chicago

sports anchor who has about as
much trouble getting women as
Night Court's Dan Fielding.
Well, Max has a best
friend/author Jay, played by
Jason Lee {Chasing Amy,
Mallrats), who introduces him
to his beautiful and nearly per
fect editor, Samantha.
[Note for the classes of
2000, 2001, Night Court was
a television show in the eight
ies, Dan Fielding, played by
John Laroquette, was involved
with a lot of women]
The movie actually begins
at the end, as the story is told
by a guest at the wedding of
Samantha and one of the two
guys. Which one will it be?
Well, it shouldn't be too tough
to figure out, but it's pretty fun
anyway.

Needless to say, Max falls
in love and sets about setting
his mind on marriage. How
ever, Max isn't so sure about
Samantha, who, by the way, is
played wonderfully by relative
newcomer Mili Avital (Dead
Man, Stargate). Due to his
own insecurities. Max tries to

get his best friend, Jay, to test
Samantha, saying "I want you
to try and get Sam to sleep with
you." Schwimmer and Lee do a
nice job playing roles that are
a refreshing change from some
of their more well known char
acters. Viewers (like me) who
generally find Schwimmer's
whiny, sensitive Ross character
from Friends really annoying,
will be pleased with Max.
Schwimmer does an ex
cellent job playing a real jerk,
kind of an anti-Ross. Lee, who
could easily become typecast as
the wonderfully obnoxious
Banky from Chasing Amy, does
a nice job playing a nice guy.
Now I won't spoil the
movie for you by telling you
what happens, but I will say
this: this is a good movie and
one that keeps the viewer in
terested. The dialogue is witty
and engaging, and the actors
do a solid job.

I personally do not like
David Schwimmer, and usually
try and avoid him, yet in this
movie he does an excellent job.

Jason Lee captures that hysteri
cal sarcasm and cynicism which
made him so enjoyable in the
two Kevin Smith features
which have made him so no
ticeable.
Add in an enjoyable and
believable performance by
Avital and some familiar sup
porting cast members and you
have a movie that works.
Maybe guess I'm getting
soft in my old age, because I fell
for Kissing a Fool like a brick.
Jason Lee and the surprisingly
good David Schwimmer turn in
solid performances, which carry
what would be an otherwise
predictably sappy movie. Sure,
it's formula, but it works.
Three stars (out of five).
I liked Kissing a Fool; the
story and the actors made me
happy to have committed part
of my afternoon to it.

I tend to be harsh on ro
mantic comedies, mainly be
cause I haven't liked many of
them since When Harry Met
Sally, but without hesitation I
give this an enthusiastic three
and a half stars. See it!

An expedition in the supermarket...

by Kim Redding and Karen
Hesselbach Contributing Reporters
Don't you find entering
a supermarket intimidating?
Some individuals have no idea
where to start as they walk up
and down the wide aisles full
of various and unlimited
amounts of food products. An
often pondered question is
"What is the right product to
purchase?" There is no right or
wrong, but healthy food is im
portant.
Buying healthy food in
the supermarket is an issue that
is widely discussed and quickly
becoming a popular subject
when wondering what to eat.
The government has provided
a dietary guideline for the
American people which re
sembles a pyramid. This pyra
mid guides a consumer of what
to eat daily. To maintain a
healthy weight, it advises eat¬

ing a variety of foods in order
to consume the proper nutri
ents and right amount of calo
ries. The base of the food
pyramid is filled with bread,
cereal, rice and pasta. It is
stated that people should eat
six to eleven servings daily. Fill
ing the pyramid above the base
are fruits and vegetables. The
proper amount of daily fruit
consumption is two to four
servings, and three to five serv
ings for vegetables.
The next tier is shared by
meat, poultry, fish, dry beans,
eggs, and nuts, as well as milk,
yogurt, and cheese. The meat
and poultry level advises two
to three servings daily, which
is also the advisable amount for
the dairy group. Finally, top
ping the pyramid is the fats,
oils, and sweets group. This is
the least important category,
which should be consumed
sparingly.

After pushing the heavy,
squealing cart through the au
tomatic doors on a routine
shopping expedition, one finds
the veggies jumping out first
because they are situated right
inside the entrance. Maybe we,
the public, should take this as a
hint. Vegetables are one of the
most important components of
our diet. Most of the time, con
sumers wheel on through, only
picking up some lettuce for
salad, and tomatoes to compli
ment it.
Why not take a few more
minutes to try something new,
like the snap peas, or perhaps
the asparagus. Instead of turn
ing your nose up, why not be
daring?
After the consumer moves
past the veggies, the routine
continues into the breads and
the meat. It's time to stop be
ing monotonous and start be
ing creative when shopping.

This creativity can add to the
benefits of a healthy shopping
trip. The following list is pro
vided to show you, the con
sumer, what is actually avail
able to be purchased.
Some foods that are dif
ferent but are still healthy are:
Thomas' Bagels, Healthy Val
ley Health Tarts (all flavors),
Sahara Whole Wheat Pita,
Buena Vita Tortillas, Pillsbury
Pizza Dough, Wasa Crispbread,
Nabisco Oyster Crackers,
Devonsheer Melba Rounds,
Krispy Saltines, Ry-Krisp,
Yoplait Light Yogurt, I Can't
Believe It's Not Butter Spray,
Sorrento Fat Free Ricotta,
Skim or 1% lowfat milk, Kraft
Healthy Favorites Cheddar
Cheese.

Also, Quaker Cream of
Wheat, Kellogg's Raisin Bran,
Post Bran Flakes, Total Corn
Flakes, Nabisco Shredded
Wheat, Musselman's Apple
Sauce, Legume Chicken Style

Vegetable Soup, Aunt Jemima's
French Toast, Kraft Free May
onnaise, and Skippy's Reduced
Fat Peanut Butter.
Learning to buy healthy
food takes time and effort. To
start your new routine, try buy
ing at least one item of each
type of food above per shop
ping trip.
Hopefully consumers
reading this will gain some
helpful information which will
lead to a successful, healthy
shopping trip. In closing, we
leave you with a few more help
ful hints when venturing out to
the supermarket.
1) NEVER food shop on
an empty stomach. This leads
to impulse buys, such as cook
ies or junk food.
2) Try and break bad hab
its. Visit the veggie section
more often. They're not that
bad!

3) Be creative with your
diet. Bon Appetit!

A light-hearted Gospel sets the foot tapping

by Barb Dickson
Features Editor
Cotton Patch Gospel,
the play performed last week
end by the Owl & Nightin
gale Players, tells the Book of
Matthew as set in Georgia,
and was billed as brimming
with good humor and sure to
set the audience's toes tap
ping. The show proved true
on both counts; I have never
found the story of Jesus so
completely amusing, and I
often found myself tapping
my foot along with the mu¬

. The musical, however,
was perhaps a little too funny.
There are many humorous
bits (three Oriental scholars
bringing the baby Jesus a gold
American Express card, a
musical group that sings about
wanting to be spitballs to
God). Maybe the humor
helped bring some people
closer to the story, but I have
never thought of the story of
Jesus as a particularly funny
one (well, except in relation
to Monty Python's Life of
Brian). It's a serious story; I
can only hope that the humor
is meant to make the story
more accessible.
Reco Grigsby, who
makes his acting debut with

this production, is outstanding
as Jesus. His voice is wonderful
and the audience was naturally
drawn to him. His counterpoint
in the song "Goin' to Atlanta,"
when he comes to grip with his
fate, is one of the most power
ful points of the show. I hope
that Grigsby continues to per
form for the theater department.
The rest of the cast played
numerous parts, but there were
some standouts. Tim Johnsen
was extremely amusing as Rock,
one of Jesus' disciples. I know I
just bashed the comedy, but if

they were going for humor,
Johnsen performed wonderfully.
His voice was very strong as
well, particularly shining in the
song "Jud."
One thing I have always
wondered about the story of
Jesus is what happened to Mary
and Joseph once Jesus grew up.
Cotton Patch addresses this is
sue as the sad parents tell Jesus
that "You are Still My Boy."
Glen Beck and Jennifer
MacMurtrie play Mary and Jo
seph, and through this song, pro
vide another poignant moment
of the musical.

Another standout was Brad
Cerelliasjohn theBaptizer. The
character was quite the South
ern preacher; it was all I could
do to keep myself from shout
ing "Allelulia!" with the cast.

Mentions also should be
made of Samantha Gregg,
whose voice soared throughout
the show; Michael Harp with
his wonderful facial expres
sions; and Duncan Niederer as
Matthew and a Cattle Farmer.
He showed emotions that ran
the gamut—from hick to a se
rious observer in awkward situ¬

.
"I Did It" and "Danger
ous Man" were two of the
more memorable songs. It's
interesting that these are two
of the darker songs of the show.
Gregg's solo in "I Did It" is sim
ply beautiful.
The choreography for the
show was rather intricate in
many parts, and kudos to the
cast for getting it right and
making it look good (though
there were parts when it didn't
look like they quite had
rhythm).
Technically, the show was
great. The lighting effects were
outstanding, and it became a
favorite pastime of mine to
watch what they would be us
ing a certain table (which
doubled as part of the set) for
next.

The set was very interest
ing, perfect for this type ol
show. There was a piece on the
stage that could be interpreted
to be either a telephone pole

or a cross, which I believe was
the purpose of the piece. But
since Jesus was lynched in this
interpretation, not crucified, it
was a somewhat confusing
piece. On the other hand, there
were negative aspects to the
show. I could barely make out
a word of the opening song,
"Somethin's Brewin' in
Gainesville." The orchestra
overpowered the cast, who
needed to articulate more and
project. However, they did fall
more into the show as it went
on and became easier to under
stand. Many of the male cast
members had somewhat weak,
though passable, voices. The
women were a bit better,
though they occasionally got a
little screechy in some of the
high parts. However, since
most of the songs were very up
tempo, this didn't matter too

much. One thing that really
bothers me about this show is
the fact that it changes the Gos
pel. Too many liberties were
taken; Jesus did not blatantly
tell his disciples that he was
going to die in Jerusalem (or
Atlanta, as the case may be),
and he was not killed in the
middle of nowhere where no
body could see.
Because of this, the show
did not have much emotional
impact on me; it was simply
amusing. However, it did have
a strong emotional impact on
others around me.
Overall, it was a very en
joyable musical. It has its nega
tive aspects, but what doesn't?
The show received standing
ovations at all six perfor
mances, which definitely says
something. It was well worth
watching, a pleasant experi
ence, and I'm glad I went.

Q: If I look up a book on
Muscat and it says it's in cata
loging, does that mean I can't
get it? A: You're in luck because
you can request the item you're
interested in right on Muscat.
Once your item comes up on
the screen saying that __j_^

the status in i
"in catalog- _^^ _P_*

"bindery" or
"on order,"
choose the
" + " option
on the
menu be
low. Then
choose the _^ ^^
command let- ^^
ter "G" (for "get")
to request the item

you desire. The screen ^™
will then prompt you to en
ter your name, your ID num
ber, and any special instructions
you may have.'
The book you want will
then be recalled, rush cata
loged, or reserved in your
name, so whenever it's avail
able, it's all yours.
Q: What does the loca
tion "Oversize Books" mean
on Muscat?
A: It means that the par
ticular book you're looking up

is over 28.5 centimeters tall
(that's more than 11 inches, for
those of you who are not met
ric-inclined). Many publishers
choose a taller format because
they want to emphasize the vi
sual content of the book.
For example, many art
books are oversized. We shelve
oversized books together in the
southeast corner of

back

from the
stairs, turn left, and go all the
way back.

Conflict & Consensus
~~ I "Stay on the macadam!"
to distract

by Rick Deutsch
Columnist My grade school recess
monitor, Mr. Manno, a fright
ening individual, is only
memorable for one piece of
advice: "Stay on the mac
adam!" Surprisingly, while
none of us knew what mac
adam was, we clearly under
stood the command and fol
lowed orders. We stayed on
the macadam and off the grass.
Sometimes I wish we had
a Mr. Manno here at Gettys¬

burg College. Something has
happened to the campus physi
cally in the past year. When I
had visitors here last year they
told me they were impressed
with Gettysburg's beauty and
they remarked how lucky I was
to go to school here. This
year's visitors have called the
campus "nice," and that both
ers me. My final decision to
attend Gettysburg was in part
based on the physical design of
the campus. To lose that
beauty would be unsettling.

Anyone who has lived,
or is currently living, in
Hanson will tell you that there
is a phenomenal shortcut
through the small bushes that
guard the cement path, which
removes at least forty feet of

paved pathway. All students
have to do is walk across the
lawn. I was proud to be one of
the people who introduced the
bypass to my friends. I insisted
that it saved valuable walking
time. Needless to say, once the
grass became a matted foot
path, everyone started using
the shortcut. Once March
came around there was noth
ing but a brown muddy stripe
dissecting the lawn. The
bushes along the path, subject
to months of abuse, died as

well. So there's a burnt out
patch on the side of Hanson
Hall. Not a big deal, right? It
isn't a big deal, of course.
However, similar patches ap
pear all over the campus. For
example, the grass between
Breidenbaugh and Weidensall is
turning brown from being
trampled, as is the grass in front
of Servo and in front of the
CUB. Stine Hall is circum
scribed by a pale brown ring,
separating the dorm and its
once green lawn.

As students, we can t con
trol all environmental issues on
campus like the puddles that
form from our Seattle-like rain
or our ongoing mud problem.
However, we can easily control
damage we cause on campus.

Gettysburg isn't like some
boarding schools that give stu
dents detention or fines for
walking on the grass. I do not
think draconian measures will
solve the problem. What is re
quired, though, is a conscious
effort on the part of everyone
who walks through campus to
observe simple acts of civility.
In retrospect, for all his faults,
Mr. Manno was right about
that. Ask anyone who's been to
Yankee Stadium for a day game
and been mesmerized by the
beauty of the giant green car
pet stretching across the out
field. Ask anyone who's stood
at the White House gates and
admired the lawn. Ask anyone
who's done a good lawn mow
ing job. Ask them, and listen
to the descriptions of a green,
well-manicured lawn. Maybe
that will change your thoughts
about the grass we all tramp
upon.

And if it doesn't, do what
I do. Picture Mr. Manno stand
ing in front of you, dressed in
cold grey pinstripes, twirling
his keys around his finger as
they strike his hand with a
strong metallic thud. He sees
what you are about to do and
he yells "Stay on the mac
adam!" It always works for me.

Consider this

The Commission on the
Future met this past week to of
fer its final report. The value of
this event is a subject which in
evitably arises.
The intentions of these
participants are doubtlessly
genuine; however, too many per
tinent issues, such as tenure re
form, the role of the Greek sys
tem, and the rights of interna
tional students, were neglected
or glossed over.
These issues are all worth
the attention of the campus.
Moreover, these issues are ones
which can and should be handled
by the existing campus commu
nity. With all due respect to all
of the alumni and friends of the
campus that participated in the
Commission on the Future, their
suggestions are well received, but
in terms of substantive changes,
their detachment from the day
to day operations of the college
puts them at a disadvantage.
There are many talented
and involved students on this
campus, as the recent close sen
ate races shows. Furthermore,
there are many dedicated profes
sors who possess the knowledge
and vision to shape a better cam
pus, both in the short and long
term. Students and faculty
should come together to address
the pressing issues on this cam
pus. For instance, is it time to
abolish the Greek system? Is the
$50,000 grant for student activi
ties merely a bone being thrown

to the students us
from calling for real social
change? Does the administration
truly care about what students
and faculty think? Recent ten
ure issues seem to suggest the
answer is no.
It is time for the student
body to throw down the gaunt
let to the administration of this
college and push for changes
now. Planning is fine, but action
is needed. Current students and
faculty should be the Commis
sion for the Future and not
merely "resources to the Com
mission on the Future Task
Forces."
Most of the changes sug
gested by the Task Force will not
be implemented until current
students have long since gradu
ated, if at all. Even so, it is the
current campus community who
should have had a major say on
the Commission. We are the
ones who truly know what is
going on at Gettysburg. We are
the ones who know what needs
to be changed.
The Commission on the
Future is a good idea on paper,
and what they turned out are a
lot of ideas that look good on
paper. Many are too vague to
be implemented. Many are steps
that seem pointless.
The usefulness of the
Commission is highly question
able. Kudos to the Commission
for their work, but a question re
mains: how much is it truly
worth?

To the Editor:
The biographical sketch
about me in the February 6 is
sue of The Gettysburgian was
a reasonable summary of a
conversation I had with the au
thor many months ago. A few
inaccuracies, however, should
be noted. The statement that
I give ",.. difficult pop quizzes"
is not correct. This should
read "piece-of-cake unan
nounced examinations." I do

not conduct research on
fullerenes, an interesting class
of organic compounds, but not
one in which I have been ac
tive. Finally, I do not end the
day with "...coffee and smok
ing a cigar." I haven't smoked
a cigar since Franklin Roosevelt
defeated Alf Landon.

CONFLICT & Consensus
Sacred ritual or silly waste of time?
To the editor:

Throughout the course of
the three years that 1 have spent
at Gettysburg College one ot
the most divisive debates that
has perpetually raged in the
The Gettysburgian has been the
struggle between the support
ers and detractors of the Greek
system raised some valid
points, such as the error of
overgeneralizing the tendencies
of such a large group of people,
I was compelled to wonder
what exactly these people are
out to accomplish during their
stay here in sunny Pennsylva¬

. Across the four elo
quently stated pieces, the edi
torials drove home the pro
found importance of their
struggle for the good of man
kind, and the contribution of
the "Turkey Trot" in the con
flict to save the free world.
Great. I do applaud the ef
forts of all organizations that
promote service to the less
fortunate. However, J
throughout my daily trav- J
els in the mail-room and J
Servo, I have more often 1
overheard such tales of the m
heroism of "Buddha's" I
keg
weekend than of wide- M _^
spread Greek enthusiasm ^^
about working in a soup

kitchen. There are many op
portunities on this campus for
caring individuals to contribute
to society, including GECO,
Habitat for Humanity, and the
Center for Public Service to
name but a few. The people
who make a true commitment
to these organizations deserve
recognition, for they are the
ones who are working to bet
ter the world in which we live.
If you are interested in making
a contribution to a program for
the general good you are in
luck at Gettysburg College, for
there are many groups that are
dedicated to a variety of noble
causes. I'm sorry, but the "An
chor Splash" does not rank as
a philanthropic feat.
One of the contributing
writers passionately argued for

research to be done in the mat
ter, before the Greek system is
dismissed as a haven of alco
hol abuse and loud music. He
compared his fraternity to a
political party. Let's be serious.
Can you really argue that each
organization of the Greek sys
tem has its own platform,
agenda, or ideology? If the do,
then I was greatly misled in my

penences ^^^^^^^
in the system. ^^^
Like many unfortunate
freshman souls who find them
selves in the middle of the
farmlands of southern PA with

nothing else to do, I too briefly
participated in the rush pro
cess. In addition, I have also
been to several Greek social
events. Not once was I given
any information about the
proud "ideals of the chapter."
Never did i meet a member of
the system who gave any indi
cation of any individual idea
behind their organization. In
the end, I concluded that each
fraternity was the same as the
next, and that warm Natty
Light tastes the same in a plas
tic cup no matter where you

drink it.
This brings me to my next
point. This is Gettysburg Col
lege, "college" being the opera
tive word. The main goal of
everyone attending this liberal
arts institution should be aca
demic excellence. In defense
of the Greek system, one of the
articles boasted that every fe
male must acheive at least a 2.2
GPA in order to take part of the
rush process. You call
that aca¬

demic ex- ^^^^^^
cellence? Now I'm ^^^
not sure what with the
tricky 4.0 equals an A "system,
but 2.2 isn't too good. No less
than four of my six professors
this semester have complained
about the lethargic state of a
large portion of their unpre
pared students. Two of those
have also asked when the rush
ing and pledging process would
finally be over, and griped
about its connection to poor
attendance. It is not surpris
ing that the faculty of this col
lege once voted to abolish the
Greek system. I find it hard to

believe that the professors are
no more than a mob of heart
less, fun-hating demons, at
tempting to crush the good
time of a few honest pupils
under their jackbooted heel of
oppression. It's more likely
that the anti-Greek sentiments
of a great many of our faculty
are driven by their care for the
maintenance of the high aca
demic standards of this institu¬

tion. Indeed, it is troubling
when before the beginning of
class a group a fresh
man fe

way to retrieve a hoagie

ing. Perhaps I am lazy, but
something would have to be
pretty important to get me out
of bed that early with classes
early the next morning. I don't
think that my buddy's craving
for processed lunchmeat would
be enough to do the trick. With
the hefty cost to attend Gettys
burg College, one must re
evaluate one's priorities. If you
came to this college motivated

to take part in these pointless
rituals or to drink until projec
tile vomiting is achieved then
you are likely to be successful
with little effort. On the other
hand, you could strive for
something more meaningful. I
am sure that there are many
Greeks who have maintained a
high GPA here at Gettysburg
College. However, the Greek
system as a whole has long suf
fered from a reputation of the
poor academic performance of
its members. If this is merely a
fasle stereotype then I suggest
providing better evidence of
your "high values" than an ane
mic GPA requirement of 2.2.
I am not an advocate of
abolishing the Greek system,
and to tell you the truth it is of
little consequence to me if it
stays or goes. I simply believe
that all students of this college
should remember why they are
here. The education that is

available here is of immense
worth. After all, you are foot
ing a bill that comes damned
close to $30,000 per year.
However, it is not the job of
professors to pour knowledge
into students' heads, as one
pours a 40 of Colt 45 down
one's throat; It is every indi
viduals responsibility to make
his or her stay here worthwhile.
Instead of hiding behind claims
of high academic standards
(2.2?!) and the supposed sa
credness of the rituals of Greek
life, I suggest you examine your
priorities. Don't squander the
opportunity that you have here
at Gettysburg College. In the
immortal words of our be
loved, former Vice President
Dan Quayle in an address be
fore a civil rights, "It is terrible
to live with a wasted mind."
(What he meant was that a
mind is a terrible thing to
waste, but you get his drift.)
Sincerely yours,
Bridging the gap to the
twenty-first century,

CONft/CT & Consensus
Gimme that old

time religion

By Jay Spiese
Columnist People who are active in
social work on campus are of
ten frustrated by the level of
apathy on this campus. One
person I interviewed last semes
ter said that the campus is typi
cally four or five years behind
the latest trends. A quick
glance through old issues of the
Gettysburgian in the library
bares this out. Streaking first
caught on at Gettysburg about
six years after the rest of the
nation had put their pants back

on. In a more serious vein,
Gettysburg College seems to be
breaking with this tradition. In
at least one area we are in synch
with mainstream America and
that is religion. This nation
appears to be entering into a
new period of religious revival.
Look at the major forces in
politics today and one finds a
high degree of religious in
volvement. Everyone from the
Christian Coalition to the Rev
erend Jesse Jackson have given
their voices to the debate.
In social work, religion
once again holds the prominent
role. Find any soup kitchen,
homeless shelter, or other grass
roots charity and you will prob
ably find a church sponsoring
it.

Unlike previous revivals
this one appears to be more
ecumenical. For once Roman
Catholics are involved in and
are helping to shape the revival
to an equal degree as their Prot
estant brothers and sisters.
At our local level we see
the small signs. Go to service
on Sunday and see how many
more students attend now then
did a year ago. I know that the
Catholic services see more at
tendance and participation
than last year. This year, in
fact, a group of Catholic stu
dents will receive the sacrament
of Confirmation (congratula
tions by the way). Friends who
attend the Protestant services
say they are seeing similar reli¬

gious awakening.
By saying we are entering
a period of religious revival
does not mean that we are do
ing a stereotypic revival. There
is no tent where we gather to
hear a man call us to repen
tance before we are damned.
We are not out singing hymns
as people walk up to a podium
and testify to how God saved
them from their wickedness.
This is a minority on our cam
pus. Most of us come from a
mainstream denomination like
Episcopalian, Lutheran, and
Catholic which do not typically
use these practices. What we
are doing on this campus is
harkening back to our denomi
national roots, expressing the
practices anew, and coming to
gether with other denomina
tion to express their common
ality.

Neither are we constantly
thinking or even fully conscious
of what is going on around us
as a revival. Most of us see our
return to faith as a personal
choice with little bearing on the
world beyond the chapel doors.
If religion is important enough
for us to want to attend services
and participate in the rites of
our particular faith then ele
ments of it will surface in our
action. This does not mean
that we are constantly fretting
over our salvation or bemoan
ing our every sin. Some of us
may simply pray others may
read scripture. In short we are

humble sinners trying to be
saints. I ask your indulgence for
my use of the Christian portion
of our campus. I use them
merely because they are the
largest segment and are thus
the easiest to observe. But the
revival I am speaking of goes
beyond Christianity. The fast
est growing religion in America
is a relative new comer, Islam.
Other eastern religions like
Bhuddism are also growing.
The points while we may not
be leading this movement we
can and should take pride that
we are a part of it.

Trust busting on the hill

Netscape Navigator instead of
Microsoft's browser." Wednes
day morning, Senate Judiciary
Committee chairman Orin
Hatch stated that the hearing
is not meant "tor criticizing or
attacking any single company."
In the hearing, James
Barksdale, CEO of Netscape
Communications, and Scott
McNealy, CEO of Sun
Microsystems, made efforts to
try and gain Hatch's support.
Bill Gates claims, "As you
know, a monopolist, by defini
tion, is a company that has the
ability to restrict entry by new
firms and unilaterally control
price. Microsoft can do nei
ther." Gates does not want the
federal government to inter
vene in his company and its
progress.

Microsoft chief Bill Gates
appeared before the Senate Ju
diciary Committee on Wednes
day. It is thought that
Microsoft is abusing its mo
nopoly power. James
Barksdale, chief executive of
ficer of Netscape Communica
tions fears that "unless (abuse
of monopoly powers) ad
dressed through enforcement
of our antitrust laws, [it] will
adversely affect the course of
American commerce and com
munications in the information
age." ABC News stated, "The
Justice Department charges
Microsoft threatened to revoke
Compaq Computer's license
for Windows 95 (Microsoft's
bestselling operating system)
after the computer-maker tried
to steer Internet surfers to

ABC News reported
"Microsoft chief Bill Gates told
the Senate today that his com
pany does not have a monopoly

and that the government
should keep its hands off the
software industry."
Microsoft brought in 100
billion dollars to the national
economy last year, claims
Gates. So, leave the man alone
as long as he is not breaking any
laws. Contributing that much
money to the national economy
is helpful to our entire nation
and should not be shunned.
Business is a game, and must be
played by all players fairly; even
if one of the richest men in the
world is playing. Having
money does not mean you have
power to break the laws.
My advice to Barksdale
and McNealy, you both are
right to make sure that the
game is being played fairly,
however, don't you think that
it would be in your best inter
sst to spend time improving
_pour companies than pointing
_^our fingers at a competitor?

Women's Basketball ends winning season
Dravis twins, Malloy lead team in 17-8 record

From Gettysburg College Press
Release There were two double
figure scorers and one
rebounder who stood as tall as
trees above the others. The
remainder of the wealth was
evenly distributed as the Get
tysburg College women's Bas
ketball team recorded its sev
enth winning season in the last
eight years.
The Bullets completed
the year with a 17-8 record and
finished in a tie for second
place in the west division of the
Cenntenial Conference with a
10-4 final tab.
The Bullets fought hard,
but lost a spot in the playoffs
when Western Maryland
handed them a 68-57 beating
in the tie-breaker contest.

Three of the most domi
nating players on the squad
were the Dravis sisters, Jen and
Stephanie, and junior Megan
Malloy. The twins, who were
each 5'6" and four year start
ers, acounted for 590 points
this season.
Steph averaged 13 points

per game and
Jen averaged
11.6. Jen also
had a 5.1 re
bound average,
to put herself
second on the
roster in that
category. Steph
and Malloy
were the vic
tims of injuries
during the te
dious season
which most
likely effected
their statistical
averages.
Steph
posted 966
carreer points
and the extra

two games
would have
given her an
oppurtunity to
join sister Jen in
the 1000 point
club. Jen com
pleted her ca-

Bullet sharpshooter Steph Dravis ended an illustrious college
career this season. She and her sister, Jen accounted for
2,014 points during the last four years.

reer with 1048 points placing
her fifth in the college's all time
scoring list. Malloy, not only
sustained an injury that kept

her out of three games, but was
late joining the team in pre-sea
son drills because of her stud
ies in Austrailia.

As it was,
Malloy domi
nated the
boards with
197 rebounds
for a 9.4 aver
age. With one
good season
remaining,
Malloy has
655 rebounds,
needing 251
more to break
the Gettysburg
record held by
Amy Hymes,
1992-96.
No less
than ten play
ers were given
starting assign
m e n t s

throughout the
year. Among
the leaders
were sopho
more Jamie
Dawson; se
nior captain

Beth O'Boyle, and sophomore
Megan McDonald. Dawson
finished the season with 114
rebounds for a 4.6 average and

scored 183 points. O'Boyle
turned in her best season with
122 points and 55 assists.
McDonald, a 6'0 forward, not
only rammed home 105 points
but accoutned for a team high
28 blocked shots and 36 steals.
Gettysburg averaged 4.6
three-pointers per game. The
Dravis twins evenly split 80 of
the team's 116 and O'Boyle
was third in line, landing 15 of
44. Dawson turned in the best
shooting percentage of 55 per
cent. Steph Dravis was the best
foul shooter, hitting 85 of 105
for 81 per cent. She also led
the team with 57 assists and sis
ter Jen topped the team with
49 steals.
While Gettysburg's over
all shooting improved and the
shooting margin was four
points better that the
oppostion, the Lady Bullets fell
two tenths per game behind the
opposition when it came to to
tal rebounding.

There were only five se
niors on this year's squad. Be
sides the Dravis twins and
O'Boyle, the only other senior
were Karen Albanesius, and
Katie Monahan.

Softball team combines experience with fresh talent

From Gettysburg Press Release
With three returning All
Centennial Conference players
and a veteran at all but two
postions, Gettysburg Head
Softball Coach Mike
Kirkpatrick is feeling pretty
good about his defense.
"We have a couple of po
sitions I would like to see a little
stronger," Kirkpatrick said, "
but overall we should be in
pretty good shape. All the m
fielders have strong arms and
excellent gloves. The outfield
ers have the same in addition
to good speed. As far as the
pitching is concerned, I have
never had this many pitchers,
but I don't have a dominating
performer."

Not only does
Kirkpatrick have ten letter win
ners in the fold, including seven

of his top eight hitters from last
year's 24-9 season, but "this is
one of the best freshman classes
tha I have ever had," he noted.
Freshman Alyson Adams
will play somewhere according
to Kirkpatrick. "She is that
good, that I could play her at
one of four positions: catcher,
first base, third base, or right
field," he continued. However,
when one looks over the re
turning talent, it is hard to fig
ure out who will be bumped.
For instance, All-Confer
ence first team Erin Killeen, is
back at first base, following a
.308 sophomore year, senior
Marybeth Korejko who batted
.340 last year returns to third,
and sophomore Karyn Miller
who started 31 of 33 games and
batted .333, is back behind the
plate. The two returning m-

fielders who have not felt the
pressure from the yearlings
have been senior Jill Murphy
at second base, and junior Sara
Gravehne, at shortstop.
"Right now they are
solid," Kirkpatrick said with a
smile. For the fourth straight
year, senior Traci Bullock will
be starting in right field. She
was a second team all-confer
ence selection last year as well
as an academic all-conference
with a 3.4 or better grade point
average. Bullock also lead the
team with a .400 batting aver
age in 1997.
However, the other two
outfield positions are up for
grabs. Two freshman who have
strong arms and exceptional
speed could move into the
starting spots are Jen White and
Casey Stevens. Veteran Jody

Noel is also a prime candidtate,
but she is also in the running
for the DH job. " When you
have a sub-three seconds run
ner to first base, you have to
have her in the lineup some
where," Kirkpatrick said of
Noel. Another freshman with
the same amount of speed is
Jess Rising.
J unior Angle Hoptak, still
rules as the number one hurler
on the squad. Two others per
formed well in the 1997: jun¬

ior Suzanne Daily, and
sopohomore Mehssa hazard,
(4-0). This staff will be sup
ported by two yearlings, Gracie
Stokes, and Katelynn Gorton.
Gettysburg leaves Satur
day ,March 7, for Ft. Myers,
Fla. where they will play seven
games begimng with St. John
Fisher College on Sunday,
March 8 at 4 p.m. The team's
first nothern engagement will
be a doubleheader at
Ehzabethown on March 18.

Florida here we come..

Baseball begins rigorous preseason training

by Ted Hartman
Sports Reporter

On Sunday March 8, the
Gettysburg Bullets will kick off
their 1998 baseball season with
a doubleheader against St. John
Fisher College and Washington
College, as part of a week long
stint in Cocoa, Florida.
Flying out of Baltimore
Washington International Air
port, the squad of twenty six
should reach their Ramada Inn
early Saturday morning. The
former site of the Houston
Astros will host this warm
stretch of games.
Though the Bullets will
be pitted against certain
Cennetenial Conference teams,
the Florida games will only
count for Gettysburg's overall
record and are considered non
league.

Coach John Campo is
definitely looking to come back
north with a number of victo
ries, however he has a number
of different objectives for this

trip. While the Bullets will ence play_,
eventually have a four-man starter to
pitching rotation, eight differ- want
ent men will take the mound —-

as starters over eleven con
tests. This should give
Campo an opportu- A
nity to solidify the _^ fl
roles of his J_^^M
pitchers with J_^^^^

Florida, ^^^^^_ft
sophomores ^^^H
Paul Koether, and _^_B

Dan Sirpinski, and ^^_B
freshmen Tom Boob and ^^
Drew Chiesa fill the prob
able rotation.
"The Florida trip will
give us an opportunity to evalu¬

ate things and look at some
people. Given a chance, certain
guys may be able to redefine
their roles. Primarily, we are
trying to prepare for Confer-

h a s _^_BJ never
seen "_? playing time
at the Var- sity level," said
Campo.

If we were to lose a at

A_^^^_y Offensively,
_^H_^ the Bullets are confi
^^ dent the team will be
r able to plate baserunners
with the powerful sophomore
bats of Kevin Grimm, Bill
Beining, and John Woods. Bret
Thorpe has ability in his short
compact swing, and will start
at second base as a freshman.
The slate of teams
marked for the Bullets repre
sent a collection of solid pro
grams with traditional com¬

petitive records. Following
Sunday's double-header, Get
tysburg will play another two
games, taking on Ehzabethtown
in the morning and Clark that
afternoon. Tuesday's schedule
pits the Bullets against Case
Western and Ursinus.
Campo's squad has an off
day on Wednesday. The major
ity of the players will probably
go the beach. Some might visit
the nearby Marlins training
camp or spend the day at
DisneyWorld. However, the
Bullets havea 10:00 a.m. game
with Ehzabethtown again on
Thursday morning. Friday and
Saturday who will be playing
double headers for Gettysburg
playing at 10:00 and 1:00
against Susquehanna, Roches
ter, Wesley, and St. Lawrence.
After returning to Penn
sylvania a week from this Sun
day, the Bullets should be ready
to open their conference sea
son. On March 17 Gettysburg
will host Cenntenial Confer
ence foe Catholic at 3:15

Men's Lax prepare for run to NCAAs

by Henry Fawell
Sports Reporter
While most of the cam
pus is still waiting for winter
to melt away into spring, the
Gettysburg Men's Lacrosse
squad has beaten the heat and
gotten an early start on a sea
son packed with high hopes
and expectations. Despite the
new faces and changes, the '98
team will be measured by the
traditional rigorous standards
which have made the program
what it is today: a model of

excellence.
Coach Hank Janczyk en
ters his 11th season as head
coach for the Bullets. Last year
saw him not only win his 100th
game at Gettysburg, but also
become the winningest lacrosse
coach in the school's history.
Janczyk will be joined on the
sidelines by second year
coaches Jaime Steele, a former
Bullet captain, and Jack
Edwards. Dave Cornell, a two
time All-Amencan and '96 Get
tysburg graduate, has returned
to the program, as well.

The Bullets will be led
this year by four captains who
have proven, by the vote of
their peers, to be excellent lead
ers and motivators. Seniors
Andrew Edgerton, Scott
Lowery and Doug Sage will be
joined in their new positions by
Junior Brian Abott.
The Bullets will have to
replace several of last year's

seniors, who helped lead the
squad to an 11-5 record and an
appearance in the NCAA tour
nament semi-finals. The most
visible absences will be those of
Joe Feldman, Tom Valeo and
Brett Strait at midfield. All
Amencan James Gohng's de
parture leaves a void in the de
fense, as well.
Fortunately, last year's
role players are now well pre
pared to take the reigns in
1998. Midfielders such as Sage,
Mark Pollack, Rob Crowe Lee
Hemming, and Gregg Tebbe
will provide the bulk of the
scoring from their position,
with Crowe handling the ma
jority of the face-off duties.

Bullet lax players face-off in preseason training

Freshmen Pete Milhman and
Tommy Pierce have been im
pressive and will be tough to
overlook come game time.
Doug Cote, who's senior sea
son once appeared finished af
ter ankle surgery, is eying a
mid-season return which could
provide a big boost in scoring.
Janczyk can rely on both
talent and experience when it
comes to the attack. Seniors
Scott Lowery and Jamie
Bateman have seen significant
playing time their last two
years. Lowery's team-high 49
points in '97 earned him All
Conference and All-America
status. The third slot will likely
be filled by junior Ross

Garretson.
Defensively, the Bullets
return two of '97's three start
ers, including All-Conference
pick Brian Abbot. Abbot has
proved to be one of the most
talented and consistent players
on the roster, as he has started
every game in his two year ca
reer at Gettysburg. Senior Mike
McCram returns to the line-up
as well, hoping to pick up on
last season's pace which saw
him shut down a number of
opposing attackmen. Junior
Justin Domingos has shown
enough savvy and aggressive
ness in preseason to claim the
third spot in the starting line
up.

At defensive midfield,
Brian Rentschler and John Tay
lor, who both provide size and
solid stick checks, will see most
of the action.
Sophomore Andrew Bar
ter has firmly entrenched him
self in goal after last year's stel
lar freshman campaign. Barter
racked up 191 saves and a tow
ering 63.9 per cent save per
centage, while starting all six
teen games for the Bullets. His
most notable performance
came in the NCAA

quarterfinals when he piled up
21 saves in a 10-9 overtime win
over rival Salisbury State.
Thus, the faces may
change every spring, but the
talent and the expectations re
main high. This year, the Bul
lets will be gunning for their
eighth consecutive post-season
appearance under Janczyk, one
of the longest streaks in Divi
sion III. Their sights will also
be set on big games with an
nual powerhouses like Wash
ington &c Lee, Salisbury State
and Washington College.

"We need to treat every
game the same," said middle
Andrew Edgerton, "we didn't
do that last year and we barely
squeaked in the playoffs. But if
we play hard every game this
year we'll be in good shape."
Gettysburg opens the
1998 season this Saturday at
Musselman Stadium where
they square off against nation
ally ranked Roanoke College.

pulled his hamstring,
which sidelined him—and
his seven points and four re
^ bounds per game--for
_^ t hree games. His injuries,
_Q_^_k a long with several oth
m_^_B ers, accounted for the
¦Bullet's 1-3 record after
Christmas. The Bullets
did manage to regain their

form, and ended up winning
seven of their next nine games.
The team made a good run for
the conference playoffs, and
only needed to win their last
two games in order to make the
show. Unfortunately the team
lost those two games, which
ended the season.
The outlook for next
year's team looks good. The
team is losing two senior lead
ers, who will be hard to replace.
The core of the team is still in
tact though, and should be
strong for next season. Look
for Pfeil and the core of this
team to lead the Bullets to even
more wins next season.
