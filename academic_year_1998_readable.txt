Gettysburg announces Cosby Scholarship

Noted educator and entertainer Bill
Cosby was the speaker for Gettysburg's
162nd Commencement exercises held this
past May 1. At that time, the College an
nounced its establishment of a scholarship
in the name of Ennis Cosby, the speaker's
late son, who was killed earlier this year.
According to the announcement, be
ginning in 1998 funds donated by Gettys
burg College trustees will be used to annu
ally provide a partial scholarship to a stu
dent attending Gettysburg College. Approxi
mately 40 current and past College trustees
have made initial donations of almost
$50,000 to the fund.
The Ennis Cosby Scholarship will be
awarded with preference to students who

Award established in memory of entertainer's late son

from Staff Repor ts

have particular interest in becoming teach
ers. Preference will also be given to stu
dents from the greater Philadelphia area.
"When one considers the lifetime of
caring and giving that Bill Cosby has un
selfishly lived, the tragic death of Ennis,
his only son, virtually begged for a com
passionate, yet dignified response," said
Bruce Stefany, the Gettysburg trustee who
coordinated the scholarship fund-raising
among the trustees. "We were looking for
an effort that would carry forward the good
works of Bill cosby and those that were done
by Ennis. We know we cannot replace the
person, but Gettysburg College is commit
ted, through the scholarship, to helping oth
ers complete Ennis' unfulfilled pursuits in
education and teaching," added Stefany.
Cosby indicated an interest in address
ing the Gettysburg graduates in 1996, as part

In his conferring the honorary degree
upon Cosby, College president, Gordon
Haaland called Cosby's past achievements

"classics of American comedy." Haaland
also told the entertainer that "You have dis
mantled barriers of race and color and set
aside stereotypes, gently but firmly, by be
ing yourself. You have helped make us com
fortable with difference and diversity; you

have somehow taught us to value both our
racial and cultural identity, and our com
mon humanity. In triumph and in tragedy,
you've shown us how it's done. We are
proud to claim you as a native Pennsylva
nian."

Gettysburg: a beginner's guide to campus life

"I'll meet you in fifteen
minutes at Stine Lake and we can
head over to Servo. Or maybe
we can just go to LD's, but first I
have to swing over to the CUB
and hit the MAC."
Your friend just called
and left this message on you an
swering machine. You've been
here for less than a week, so natu
rally you think, "what is he talk
ing about?" Have no fear, new
student, because this handy litle
glossary of Gettysburg-speak is

sure to get you through these so
cial straits unscathed and sound
ing like an old 'Burg pro.
First things first. "Where
am I now?" and "You want me to
go where?"
Servo: a.k.a. the Dining
Hall. Probably nicknamed back
when the college's dining service
was contracted out to a company
called Servomation (eons ago).
Anyhow, you eat here. Tip: Get
here early on Premium Entree
Night. The Cordon Bleu rules.

CUB: a.k.a. The Col
lege Union Building. Here you
will find the mailroom, school
store, ballroom, first-year student
laundry room and the campus al
ternative to Servo, Cafe 101.
The Junction (for -
meriy known as _tlieEtive): This
is a place that studetn organiza
tions can hold meetings, the Stu
dent Activities Council has live
performances and movies, and
where students can just hang out.
Cafe 101: a.k.a. the
Bullet Hole. Looking for a quick

snack while you're on the run?
Travel beyond the Junction, past
the mailroom, and you're in The
Hole. You have $3.75 on you
meal card that's good for break
fast, lunch and dinner. Remem
ber, only two prepackaged items
per meal. The catch to Cafe 101
is that you can only use your meal
cards at specific hours: 8:00 -
10:15 am for breakfast, 1:30 -
4:00 pm for lunch, and 4:30- 9:00
pm for dinner. However, it stays
open until midnight in case
you're in the mood for a late night
snack.

Mailroom: Every week
day, between 11:30 am and 1 pm,
the mailroom transforms from a
drab series of metal boxes into the
very epicenter of social activity at
Gettysburg College. Here the
evening's plans are made, adn flirt
ing is perfected, check your mail,
two, three, four times a day!
MAC: a.k.a. Money Ac
cess Center, this is an automated
teller machine outside the CUB. It's
the same as MOST, Cirrus, or what
ever you're used to. This innocent
looking machine cna be both a Fri
day night life-saver and a Sunday
morning nightmare. Beware of the
lure of fast cash.
MusseknanLibrar y: It's
Tuesday night and nothing's going
on. where can I go to hang out and
meet new people? The Library is
the answer. On any given evening,
the first floors are filled with stu
dents pretending to study while

picking up the lastest gossip on
campus. Plus, when you get home
and find that your parents have
called, you can honestly say that
you were at the library. But being
there and studying are two entriely
different issues. If you really need
to do some work, the third adn
fourth fllors are your best bet. Night
owls will be happy to see that the
library is opne 24 hours a day. And
for those slaves to the almighty
bean, librarians brew coffee and
provide hot water for tea adn cocoa
for those students pulling all
nighters. Also, the library has three
day/three movie video rentals. They
may not have all the newest re
leases, but they do have some of the
best movies ever made. The library
is one of the three "Mussleman"
locations on campus, the others be
ing Mussleman stadium, and
Mussleman Hall, located in the
_Upperclass Quad.

Bream Wright Hauser:
This is the campus gym adn field
house. It's located beyond the CUB
adn across hte street from the Apple
apartments. Be sure you don't con
fuse Bream with the...
Plank Gym: This older
_eym is found between the CUB and

Masters Hall. There s a games 334-0505: Advanced sys
room adn fitness room in the base- tem run by the local newspaper,

basement. Make some requests
and bug the DJ by dialing x6313.
Many studetn organizations also
call Plank home, including the Stu
dent Activites office, GECO
(enviornmental concerns organiza
tion), the Black Student Union,
Student Senate, the Gettysburgian,
the Spectrum (yearbook), and the
IFC (Interfraternity Council), the
Center for Public Service is also in
Plank, but on the first floor.
Stine Lake: Not really a
lake at all, Stine Lake is actually
the open area between Plank Gym
and the library. One theory for the
origin of its odd name may be that
the field is known to flood during
heavy stroms. Almost knee-deep
water is not unusual on the "lake."
After a nastystorm, put on old
clothes, go out, slide around and
have your own little Woodstock.

Brua Hall, Kline The
ater,andStevens Theater: These
are all the same place and for that
reason, it can get rather confusing.
Schmucker Hall: This is
the colege's art and music build
ing. Stop in and check out the art
gallery which is filled with the
work of your fellow
gettysburgians. Frequent recitals
and concerts there, too. and they're
free! Other Important Stuff
OneRing/_T woRings: If
the phone rings once, it's an on
campus cal, and you can risk an
swering it with a more creative
greeting. If it has a double ring,
it's most likely Mom and shoudl be
anwered accordingly.

The Weather Guy(s):
There are two numbers you can cal
to get time adn hte local weather.
These numbers are helpful, but
they can becoem serious habits.
You'll soon find yourself calling
them before you walk across the
hall. Anyway, here's the spiel:

Each with its own pros adn cons,
the gettysburg area has many
pizza places but only thrcee de

and Dominos. If you have the
ways and means (i.e. a car),
Stavros Pizza in Emmitsburg, just
over the Maryladn line, is well
worth the trip.

Ernie s Texas Lunch:
Located across Chambersburg
Street from K&K Records, Ernie's
has been catering to the lunch adn
dinner crowds of gettysburg for
three generations. An "Ernie Dog"
is not to be missed, and for those
vegetarians out there, Ernies of

College receives grant for Civil war Studies program

gcpr Gettysburg College has been
awarded a grant of more than
$500,000 from the Henry Luce
Foundation to support the estab
lishment of a professorship in Civil
War studies. The Henry R. Luce
Professor of the Civil War Era will
lead an undergraduate program in
Civil War studies and will develop
and direct "The Gettysburg Semes
ter," a program selecting students
from across the country to partici
pate in a semester of intensive in
terdisciplinary study of the Civil
War era. Funds from the grant,
which covers an initial period of
six years, will be used primarily
to provide salary and benefits for

a faculty member chosen to fill the
Luce Professorship. The grant was
announced by the Foundation's
Chairman Henry Luce III. The
Luce Professor will be selected by
a committee at the College after
completion of a national search.
The recipient's appoint
ment will be made in 1998, and the
Luce Professor will begin teach
ing at Gettysburg by the fall of
1999. Gettysburg is one of only
tow higher education institutions
to receive a professorship from the
Luce Foundation during this year.
The other was Johns Hopkins Uni
versity. "Gettysburg College is
very grateful for the support of the

Luce Foundation which will allow
us an opportunity to develop great
strength in Civil War studies, we
sincerely believe that we can de
velop a program unmatched at any
other site in the country," said
Gordon Haaland, president of Get
tysburg College. "Our aim is to
use of existing relationships with
the community of Civil War schol
ars and our natural geographic con
nection with the pivotal battle of
that War to establish an integrated
first-rate undergraduate program
that allows not only our students
but also visiting students access to
a unique combination of scholar
ship and original research materi
als." "Many of the basic issues

of contemporary American society
came into focus during the Civil
War era, among those being the
relevance of race in a democracy,
the proper balance of federal and
state government, the principles
that bind Americans, the meaning
of a union. We think that a
multidisciplinary examination of
the Civil War era is a wonderful,
rich, and sound way to examine
our social fabric," said Dr. Daniel
DeNicola, the college's chief aca
demic officer.
"The professorship will
provide scholarly leadership for an

intensive program in this era, ad
dressing not only the causes and
events of the Civil War and its af
termath, but its cultural and intel
lectual milieu. The program will
draw on not only miliary and po
litical history, but, among many,
the fields of economics, sociology,
philosophy, African-american
studies, women's studies, rhetoric,
religion, literature, the visual arts,
and music. Such a study helps us
understand what was changed and
what was preserved by the war,
what was lost arid gained," added
DeNicola.

The Henry R. Luce Pro
fessorship Program wa established
in 1969 by the New York-based
foundation to encourage academic

innovation and creativity through
integrative and interdisciplinary
approaches to teaching and re
search in American private higher
education.
The first recipient of the
Luce Professorship in Civil War
Studies will be responsible for fur
ther developing existing College
curricular programs into an aca
demic concentration or minor pro
gram, with direct responsibility for
teaching the introductory and
capstone courses in that program.
By the third year of the grant, the
Luce Professor will develop and
the direct "The Gettysburg Semes
ter," for which up to 25 under
graduate students will be selected
from applicants across the coun
try for a one-semester, integrated
program of Civil War studies.

We will continue to sup
port the Luce Professor, the estab
lished Gettysburg program, and
the Gettysburg Semester upon the
completion of the six-year Luce
grant period," said DeNicola.
"The college has the option of ap
plying to the Luce Foundation for
three additional years of support,
and we are confident that our pro
grams will show sufficient
progress and strength to warrant
serious consideration."

College offers
off campus guide

There is lots to do at Gettys
burg, but sometimes students like
to get off the campus to explore
what is available in the surround
ing area. Dean of First Year Stu
dents, Robert Nordvall, has put
together a resource that sets out
opportunities for fun and recre
ation on campus and beyond. In
cluded in is information about
what to do and about things to do
in Harrisburg, Lancaster, Balti
more, Washington, and other
nearby cities.
The guide includes infor¬

mation about shopping (where are
the big malls?), parks, theaters,
movies, clubs, concerts, museums,
sports teams, and miscellaneous
attractions within an 80 mile radius
of the College. Driving instruc
tions are included so students can
find out how to get to these attrac
tions. The address for this
Guide on the Web is http://

Beware the dangers of binge drinking

College Press Service
Jennifer, a Northwestern
University Junior, doesn't recall
how she ended up at Evanston
Hospital one early morning during
Spring Quarter last year. The last
thing she remembered was doing
tequila shots with a guy she met at
a fraternity party, and then her
world turned black.
Jennifer had a blood alcohol
level of about .21, more than twice
the legal limit in Illinois, and was
unconscious when friends took her
to Evanston Hospital's emergency
room. Her breathing was irregu
lar, and her friends told her that she
looked like a ghost.
"I was so scared," Jennifer
says as she shakes her head and
looks at the floor. "It was one of
the worst moments of my life. I
thought I was having such a good

Adelman writes devilish book

time, and then I wake up in the
hospital with a needle in my arm."
Doctors had to hook Jenni
fer up to an IV to dilute her blood
quickly and lower her blood alco
hol content. Jennifer, who doesn't
want her last name used, says the
experience changed her life be
cause she is one of the lucky ones.
She is still alive.
At least 800 high school and
college students died from alcohol
poisoning in 1994, but researchers
think the number might be higher
than 4,000 because many deaths
related to alcohol may be attributed
to other causes like cardiac arrest,
according to Students Against
Drunk Driving.

was to bring to Devil's Den the
attention it deserves as a promi
nent, but often overlooked, part of
the three-day battle," said
Adelman.
The book details the history
and folklore surrounding the site,
covers in-depth the events during
the battle, and concludes with a
detailed guide for visitors.
Adelman joined Gettysburg
College in 199S as part of the
College's dining services opera
tion.

ULFK A Gettysburg College ad
ministrator has co-written the first

history and significance of Devil's

Garry E. Adelman, a life
long students of Civil War history,
has co-written "Devil's Den: A

isn't surprised to learn about
Jennifer's experience. She often
hears of drunk students who are
found in odd places on campus,
then shipped into Evanston Hos
pital for care.
A recent survey conducted
by the American Medical Associa
tion showed that 40 percent of 800
eighteen to thirty-year olds drink
to levels that impair judgment and
physical performance.
The results demonstrate a
sad, unconscionable waste of tal
ent and potential by our country's
young people," says Nancy
Dickey, chair ofAMA's board of
trustees.
Although many people mis
take alcohol for a stimulant be
cause it can make people more

lively than their usual selves, al
cohol is actually a depressant. If a
person drinks enough alcohol it
can shut the body's immune sys
tem down and affect the circula
tory and respiratory systems.
Hong points out that many
people don't know that alcohol
alone can kill you, and you don't
have to be into the driver's seat to
die from it.
"People are afraid of taking
someone into the hospital because
of the possible consequences, or
they think that the person is passed
out and will be OK in the morn
ing," Hong says. "But this is seri
ous and instead of worrying about
the person getting in trouble, I
think it's more important that you
could be saving that person's life."

A SADD brochure lists sev
eral cases in which young adults
have died from alcohol poisoning,
including a story about Marie
Brinkmeyer. She was 18 and a
first-year student at Texas A&M
University when she bought a
bottle of tequila and took it to a
dormitor party. After drinking
heavily, Brinkmeyer collapsed adn
was carried to her bed to sleep it
off. She never woke up.
"I don't think people are
aware 1 of all the damage alcohol
can do," says Dr. David Barthwell,
medical director for the drug and
alcohol program at Northwestern
Memorial Hospital in Chicago.
"Alcohol companies make alcohol
look so appealing, but the truth is,
if you aren't careful, it can kill
you."

Involvement, participation required for success, says Nordvall

Dean of First Year Students urges new arrivals to get involved

GCPR When students first come
to college, the number of pos
sible activities to join is over
whelming. In addition, there is
the academic challenge of col
lege courses, dean of First Year
Students, Robert Nordvall, rec
ommends that students take their
time reviewing the options avail
able and deciding the activities
in which they want to participate
at Gettysburg, but he notes that
first year students should become
involved in the life of the Col
lege. A leading scholar on
the affect that college has upon
students is Dr. Alexander W.
Austin of the Cooperative Insti
tutional Research Program at

UCLA. Dr. Astin os an alumnus of
Gettysburg College. His work indi
cates that the quality of the educa
tional experience that students get in
college is directly related to how
much they are involved both inside
and outside the classroom in their
college experience. Not surpris
ingly, students who put more effort
into college, receive much greater
benefits from their four years of
higher education.
Dean Nordvall empha
sizes, however, that although almost
all activities provided benefits, not
all co-curricular activities are equal
in what they provide to students.
Students should look for activities
that provided to them strong oppor
tunities for personal growth. A small
group of activities that have proved
particularly powerful in fostering the

growth and development of stu
dents are the service learning pro
grams and community service pro
grams, and opportunities for inde
pendent study and research with
professors. There are activities
that students name as particularly
impor tant as they reflect upon their
four years at Gettysburg. There
four are not the only activities that
play such a role, and students can,
of course, take part in a number of
very beneficial activities at the
College. The Gettysburg Is Volun
teering (GIV) Day activities on the
Monday afternoon of Orientation
from 6:30 pm - 8:00 pm there will
be an Open House at the Center
for Public Service at which stu
dents can find out more about com
munity service and service learn¬

ing programs. Study abroad op
portunities will be discussed in the
rotating discussion sessions on
Monday morning of Orientation.
First year students do not ordi
narily work on research and inde
pendent study projects with pro
fessors, but during their first year
students should be sampling the
various academic programs at the
College in order to find out which
programs offer the academic chal
lenges and opportunities that are
most attractive to them.
Service learning pro
grams, community service pro
grams, study abroad, and indepen
dent study and research are pow
erful experiencesbecause they
stretch students. They force stu
dents to do and see new things.

They force students to look at the
world differently. Students can
graduate from Gettysburg College
without participating in any of
these programs, but students who
want to experience the full range
of a Gettysburg College education
should select the best opportuni
ties that the College has to offer,
both inside and outside of the class
. room.

Individualism 101

Hi, hello and welcome to
the orange and blue branch on
your tree of education: Gettysburg
College. While the world spins
wildly out of control, and empires
rise and fall around us, here
strands your academic oasis ~ and
here stands you.
In case you were won
dering, this is the student news
paper ~ your source for all kinds
fo stuff, including campus news
and opinion, but more about that
later. Here's something you
can do: leave your newly arranged
room, step out of your dorm, and
take a good look around. Notice
the green grass, the majestic build
ings. Wander around the param
eter of the campus, look at the fra
ternity houses. Sit on the steps of
Mussleman Library or the base of
the fountain and let your eyes feast
upon your new home.

Now go back to your
room and look at the mirror. Look
at yourself, remeber yourself.

And realize that all you have seen
means nothing if you do not remain
true to the person in the mirror.
Yes, this sounds like petty
advice, but consider it a moment.
At Gettysburg College you will
face your greatest academic chal
lenges and will have to pass your
most demanding tests of character.
Pressures will rise that might in
timidate you into becoming some
one you never met before. TheAll
American Scholar. The Generation
X'er. The Product of a Liberal Arts
Education. These are all nice
people, but you must question, are
they me? Oddly enough, some cli
ches do apply, including "Get In
volved" and "Be Yourself." This
campus truly offers some great
things, but some of the greatest
things are yet to appear. That's
where you come in. The college
has its weaknessess — for one, it's
just too darn expensive. Another
is its lack . of cohesiveness: for a
school of less than 2000, it is a

common thing to graduate with a
class of virtual strangers. If any
one is going to make a difference,
it will be with unique and bold
ideas and action, ones that focus
on what is best for the students (it
seems that sometimes people for
get about that sector of the "cam
pus community.")
The Gettysburgian ex
tends a hand to individuals will
ing to express their views candidly
and with fervor. We look forward
to earning your respect as your
Voice, but just in case we don't,
let us know about.
Do get involved, because
you can make the difference. Put
your prejudices aside and help
bring soem real energy to this
place. There's more here to learn
than what's in the classrooms, and
there's more to do here than spend
tuition money.

by Colleen DeBaise
College Pr ess Service
IOWACITY-For 18-year
old freshman Sharon Monaghan,
the adjustment to campus life at
the University of Iowa has been
close to trouble-free.
Except, "I forgot my robe,"
she said. "I'd really like that."
Also, she'd like a laundry bag.
The toughest part for her,
she says, is getting used to the aca
demic demands of college.
"It's a lot more work than
high school," said Monaghan, who
plans to major in biochemistry. "I
feel like a dork. I come home, do
work and then I go to bed by nine.
I'm just kind of waiting for the
homework to pile on."
So far, she gets along well
with her roommate, and they've
lofted their beds to squeeze a
couch into their tiny dorm room.
And she's not too homesick.
"You think about going
home, but all your stuff is here,"
she explains.

Being away from home.
Coping with studies. Dealing with
roommates.
Those are just some of the
concerns that nearly every incom¬

ing freshman has during the first
few weeks on campus.
A number of publication
many written by recent grads— of
fer helpful tips on surviving cam
pus life. They list tips on how to
manage with the "roommate from
hell," how not to gain the "fresh
man 15," and how to keep in touch
with Mom and Dad.
For instance, Joe Tur ton, a
1994 graduate of Denison Univer
sity in Granville, Ohio, recently
finished writing "My Freshman
Manual: The Official College
Handbook."
At Denison, Turton was a
psychology major and an athlete,
and he describes himself as
"someone who recently has been
in the trenches and is willing to
share these lessons with others."
"If I had known all the

things I included in the book be
forehand," Turton said, "I would
have avoided many problems my
self." His advice for college fresh
man: Get a phone card for calling
home. It will save you a lot of
money, and you won't have an

excuse for not calling the parents.
When you fill out your
maintenance room report at the
beginning of the year, mark every
single detail, as well as a few ex
tra. School fines can be outra
geous for very small damages to
your room.
Buy an alarm clock that has
a battery back-up. The power al
ways seems to go out in the middle
of the night.
Get to know the professors
in your major department. Letters
of recommendation are very use
ful when you are looking for a job.
Following those "rules of
thumb" will help alleviate the
stress of freshman year, Turton
said. Melanie Sponholz, a 1993
graduate of Drew University in
Madison, N.J., and her husband
Joseph Sponholz, a 1994 grad of
New York University, offer their
advice to freshman in "College
Companion: Attaining Academic
and Social Nirvana."

The book, recently pub
lished by the Princeton Review,
was written because "facing life
in a pantry-sized dorm room with

a total stranger might not be the
easiest of situations," according to
the 25-year-old authors.
They lace the book with real
students' stories gleaned from in
terviews they conducted with cur
rent college students, and com
mentary drawn from the Princeton
Review's surveys of more than
56,000 college students.
First off, the Sponholzes of
fer these tips for incoming fresh¬

man: Take care of money matters.
Open a savings and checking ac
count with a local bank, but shop
around for the best fees. Some
banks require students maintain a
minimum balance; others tack on
charges for using automatic-teller
machine cards at machines not
owned by the bank.
Have a "ground rules" chat
with your roommate. You'll each
be glad you took the time to work
out a plan to accommodate each
other's study, sleeping, eating, and
CD-blasting habits.
But, "don't be a dork about
this," the Sponholzes warn. In
stead of handing your roommate
a typed list of suggestions, have

lunch together and talk about how
you both like to live.
Once a freshman has settled
into classes and dormlife, a whole
new set of problems can arise, ac
cording to the authors.
Melanie Sponholz bases her
advice on her two years as a resi
dent advisor at a Drew dormitory.
Joseph Sponholz's perspective
comes from his years as an NYU
"frat guy" and intramural athlete.
Their tips are:
If you have the "roommate
from hell" give it some time. Dur
ing orientation week, you and your
roommate might spend 24 hours
a day with each other. But once
the school year starts, you'll most
likely have separate classes and
activities to give you some space.
Soon, you'll meet other people
and you can hang out in their
rooms.

"It's also important that you
and your roommate talk about ev
ery problem as it occurs," the
Sponholzes advise. "This way
you'll avoid a bunch of little ar
guments creating a huge blowout
between you and your roommate."

CAMPUS PLANNING CALENDAR
The staff of the Office of Student Activities/College Union is very
excited to be a part of CNAV and what it is offering the College
community.
CNAV offers a calendar of events that is similar to the Planning
Calendar that has been published by our office.
To be environmentally sensitive and in response to the budget,

Tips to guide you through the labarinth of College

Dear Casey.

by Casey Dunn
staffwriter Hello, and welcome to your
college experience! Please keep
your arms and legs inside the ride
at all times and do not exit until
the ride has come to a complete
stop. Oops, wrong introduction, I
guess summer is still not out of my
system, yet. Well, if you are still
reading, let me introduce myself,
I am Casey Dunn, the advice col
umnist, a new addition to the stu
dent news paper.
Although, in order for
this to work, I am going to need
your help. I need to have things to
give advice on, so send concerns,
questions, comments, ect to Box
#618 orBurgian @ gettysburg.edu,
and check the paper for the re
sponse from the oracle of advice,
myself.

As for this first issue I am
offering my Top Ten list of advice
I have compiled after my first year
here as a student and member of
the community. It is meant to be
both humorous and serious, so take
some time and peruse it. And be
sure to send in letters. Enjoy.
#10) Welcome to reality
well, not quite. College is a new,
independent experience, and at
first you may feel that this IS real
ity, but if you take time to think
about it, you might not be too anx
ious to cash in that reality check.
For example, in reality you have
to push more than one button to
get your laundry clean, unlike

those nifty machines that the col
lege offers. Also, reality does not
seem to accept those swell student
ID cards in exchange for food and
access to neccessary facilities, like
the fitness and weight room.
While we are on the topic of ID
cards, be sure to keep in mind that
MAC machines do not accept
them, and that you actually have
to have money in an account, BE
FORE you can access it. It is
sometimes nice to wish that real
ity was as sweet as collge. Keep
dreaming, folks, before you know
it, you will have to wake up. />
#9) Play hard, buj_^ork
harder. Even though we mdy ' pride
ourselves with bcing_^ jfiature, re
sponsible adults, capable of mak¬

ing independent decisions, we
have to be able to let our hair down
and live the life our parents could
only dream of having. This privi
lege of independence does carry
with it a cumbersome, yet fully
color coordinated, set of baggage.
As it is a privilege to be indepen
dent, we must show that we are
responsible, and able to handle that
privilege. The key here is balance,
folks. If your playful side puts on
too many extra pounds, from a
little too much beer, it is going to
throw you skinny responsible side
off the seesawand into the great
sand box of displaced college stu
dents. #8) Reputation, a blem¬

ish even Cover Girl can not fix.
This college is small and can be
come even smaller when everyone
knows where you have been sleep
ing. Bottom line is this, you might
think it is really cool to be able to
chug a bottle of Boon's wine in the
time span of the song Roxanne, but
even your ever so sexy alcohol tol
erance will not gain you the right
respect. The respect that everyone
deserves, but so many people
make the point of loosing. Do not
succumb to belittling your talents
and abilities, trust me, when the
party is over and the laughter is
faded, YOU and you alone are left
with only a hangover and porce
lain bowl to cry to.

#7) Respect, respect, re
spect. Everyone knows the 3 R's
of education, well these are the
three R's of life. Basically, if we
as a whole showed common re
spect to people this world would'"'
be a much more pleasant place to
live, starting with this campus.
Think of all the people,that help
make this place operate, the main
tenance crew, the/dinning center
and bullet hole _^ staff, the office ad
ministrator_^ 'and a myriad more.
_Sometimes; sadly, it seems that
college _^ students will look down
uno ' n these people, sorry folks, but
/tifese unique and talented people
were not put on this campus to put
the plush carpet under your "su
perior" feet. Give them respect.
Take time to appreciate their tal
ents.

#6) Have you hugged
your friend today? There is so
much written, sung, and praised
about friends. They are the ones
that sit on the highway with you
for three hours in 100 degree tem
peratures after your car overheats
and the engine seizes. They hu
mor you and participate in your
inane quests to see the sun rise
multiple days in a row. They en
able us to face each day with a
smile and give us no good excuse
for beating ourselves with our own
backbones on not so kosher days.
Yes, and the best part folks, is they

are absolutely, one hundred per
cent free. True friends, which of
ten take a while to find, and come
with no strings attached. First, re
spect yourself enough not to be
used and mistreated by people who
use you as a stepping stone to gain
their ultimate goal of a reputation.
Trust me, their reputation of being
a manipulative back slabber will
get you no where in the long run.
Second, appreciate your friends. A
good friend of mine once sent me
a poem, entitled "A Friend is
Someone Who Stays After Every
one Else Leaves", this touched me

»»rw»r arn
deeper than anymaterial apprecia
tion could have possibly done, but
it also made me realize that- this
was a true friend. She appreciated
me, and I'll tell you,. I was eu
phoric. /
#5) Parents. Wouldn't it
be nice to really, honestly believe
that we no longer have any con
nections with them, besides the 28
g's_, they are shelling out for our
education. Sorry, Sam, it is impos
sible. Yes, I know, independence,
responsibility, maturity, yadayada,
yada...but let's take a minute and

reflect on who helped you get to
where you are now. Who would
sit in the freezing November rain
to watch the everlasting soccer
matches? Who brought flowers to
your first stage performance, as
Dorothy, "In the Wizard of Oz"?
Who drove you, incessantly, to
every Laser Tag match in the state,
because you truly believed you
could conquer your arch enemies
with one swift blow from your la
ser beam. To our parents, we are
the super heroes. I say let's make
our parents the super heroes, and

us be the trainee sidekicks. The
future is a tough place, and who
better to prepare us than Mom and
Dad, defenders of the universe,
well, maybe just the car.
#4) Appreciate some
one important. Yourself. This is
tough advice to follow, especially
when your world is whizzing
around at the speed of light and
you are so deeply buried in your
new and exciting life, you often to
forget about important things.
Sleep, food, and rest, just to name
a few. Take care of you first. This
may sound self centered and self
ish, but honestly how can you ex
pect to do anything productive if
you are a walking around in a half
spent state, so stressed you are at
tempting to light a cigarette with
the filter side out. Not very. In or
der to enjoy the tremendous feast
of opportunities that is placed on
the plate of the future, you must
first learn how to chew, not gobble.
Careful folks, you might choke.

#3) The only thing that
is permanent in life is change. This
is a simple concept that most
people find a difficult time remem
bering. You know how it goes, you
stay up all night and cram for a test
that in the morning you are so sure
you have in the bag because you
can regurgitate all of Darwin's
theory's, you've memorized
Boyle's Law, you can label all
the parts of a semi-permeable
membrane of a eukariotic cell and
of course know all the enzymes of
the digestive system, and does the
Prof, ask anyof this on the test?
No, of course not. You flunk, and

are bummed. But, wait. Think of
how many tests you will take in
your future. Think about how in
ten years you will in no possible
remember you ever took this class,
and how you can not even remem
ber who Darwin was. My friend
once shared with me her mountain
and mole hill theory. You see, you
are looking at your situation up
close. You see it as a huge moun
tain that must be surpassed. Take
some steps back, let change occur,
and look at it now. It is now a mole
hill. Not as big as it seemed, and
laughable that you even thought so
much about it. Bottom line, there
is no problem that time can not fix.

It is all in how you deal with
change. #2) Get involved. You
have probably heard this a bizillion
times by now, but you need to hear
it some more. So you are at are at
Gettysburg College. With the as
sistance of many people you have
arrived on campus and now it is
up to you to make a splash with
your four year tenure here. At this
point of your life you are swim
ming in a sea of options. You can
either lay back and let the tide take
you in, or grab your boogie board
and take the ride of your life. My
advice: Hang ten, baby.
#1) Go to class. This is
by far my best piece of advice. The
main reason you are here is to re¬

ceive a quality education that will
take you places in life. Alright,
folks, we are the future. Scary,
isn't it? In ten years we will be
holding Government positions,
heading FBI operations, making
and breaking the stock market,
making more g's than Bill Gates,
and raising the new future. Times
are changing rapidly, and we need
to be able to keep pace. The per
fect training; a well rounded, fine
tuned education. GO TO CLASS.
If not for yourself, for others who
have to deal with you in the future,
for your parents who want the best
for you, and above all, for the Pro
fessors, who care enough to offer
you one of life's most precious
gifts, an education.

So that is it. Some are of
these are harder to follow than oth
ers. Some you might not agree
with. Some you may think are stu
pid. But I hope they make you
think. Reflect on exactly why you
are here, what you want to gain
from this experience, and what you
hope to offer others. I wish you
the best of luck in the upcoming
years and hopeful after this year
you will have some of your own
Do you have a question to
ask Casey? Write to her at box

Women s tennis ends season second in conference

From Staff Reports
Junior Kate Goodall
and sophomore Bev Jack
son emerged as the leading
players on Gettysburg
College's 1997 women's
tennis team.
Gettysburg completed
the regular season with a
14-2 record and was 8-2 in
the Centennial Conference,
good for second place. The
Bullets were the defending
conference champs.
Goodall, playing out
of the number six singles
post most of the season,
recorded a 14-1 record.
Jackson, who handled the
number five spot through
out the season, was 14-2
for the year.

Goodall and Jackson
formed Gettysburg's top
number three doubles team
and were also the team
leaders in that area. They
posted a 13-1 record, the
second best in the Centen
nial Conference.
However, the season's
top honor went to the
Bullets' number two
singles player, senior
Cynthia Hoenes. Hoenes
not only made the All
Centennial Conference first

team, but was named co
player of the year, along
with Johns Hopkins' Zeena
Abdi. Hoenes posted a 13
3 record.
Hoenes, one of only
two seniors on this year's
team, completes her colle
giate career with a stunning
54-13 singles record and a
48-10 doubles mark for an
overall 102-23 record.
Hoenes was joined by
junior Tara Schmitt to form
Gettysburg's number one
doubles team. They were
14-2 on the season and
were named to the all
conference first team.
They won their first seven
matches to end the season
with 14 wins.

Hoenes not only
proved to be a strong
competitor on the court, but
in the classroom as well.
She and senior Mary Joy •
Troxel were named to the
Centennial Conference's
academic honor roll for
carrying a 3.40 GPA or
better.
Gettysburg completed
its sixth season under head
coach Bill Pfitzinger this
Spring. The Bullets are 66
21 under his guidance.

Men's golf team racks up records
Forbes sets ihiee during championship

From Staff Reports
Senior Jeff Forbes
carried off the bulk of the
honors on the Gettysburg
College varsity golf team
which completed its
season in the spring.
Forbes was named to
the All-District II team.
Forbes captured his second
straight Centennial Confer
ence championship and
completed the season with
935 strikes for 12 rounds

and a team low average of
77.9. During the confer
ence championships, he set
three records: low total per
round, 72; low first two
rounds, 151; and low gross
224. Forbes' closest com
petitor was sophomore
Matt Beckert, who carded
an 80.1 average on 801
strokes for ten rounds. He
was team medalist once
during the season.

Rounding out
Gettysburg's top five golfers
on the ten-player roster, were
Senior Ryan Coffey, with an
85.2 average for 11 rounds;
freshman Rick Deutsch, 89.1
for eight rounds; and sopho
more Matt Doorley, 87.6

Strong starting lineup, Streeter s 20th make for promising season

From Staf f Reports
Not only will
Gettysburg College be
launching its 105th football
season this year, but Head
Coach Barry Streeter will
begin his 20th year at the
Bullet helm. It all began
Monday when 93
candidates reported for the
first day of pre-season
drills. Streeter is currently
the college's all-time
coaching leader with 108
victories, 80 losses and five
draws. His best season was
1985 when he guided the
Bullets through their only
undefeated regular season

and eventually completed
the year with a 11-1-1 slate
following a semi-final
placing in the NCAA
Division III playoffs.
Streeter added three
new coaches to his staff of
eight. Steve Reider, a 1995
Dickinson graduate, and
Tom Waranavage, a 1993
Muhlenberg grad, have
been assigned to the wide
receivers and tight ends
respectively. The new
outside linebacker coach is
Marty Ogle, a 1974
graduate of Sheperd.
Among the 93
candidates Streeter will
greeted on Sunday were 49

freshmen and 44
upperclassmen, including
31 letter winners. Heading
the list is sophomore Paul
Smith. Smith, a first team
all-centennial conference
fullback as a freshman,
rushed 888 yards and
scored nine touchdowns in
1996. He has been named
on of USA III Football's
top sophomores to watch in
1997. Leading the Bullets
in 1997 will be elected
captains Joe Hodakowski
and Rob Sena.
Hodakowski is a senior
linebakcer while Sena is a
senior defensive back.

The one nice thing
facing Streeter is the fact
that he has a solid starting
veteran at every position
except offensive left guard.
With an offensive line
intact, backed by an
experienced backfield, the
Bullets could unleash a
potent offense. Veterans
Chris Fugaro and Wes
Wells are back at
quarterback while veterans
Matt Helwig and Donny
McNellis will be at the
halfback slots. Joining
Smith at the fullback slot
will be another veteran,
Henry Unger, as well as the
return of Dan Sheats.

Sheats took a year off last
season for personal
reasons, after rushing for
273 yards and one
touchdown in five games as
a freshman in 1995.
The Bullets spent
the first two days going
through physicals,
equipmentadjustments,
testing and meetings. It has
been down to business ever
since with tow-a-day
sessions.
Gettysburg will
open its season on
Saturday, Sept. 13 at
Hampden-Sydney.

Football kicks off 105th season

Bullets sixth in Conference

LANCASTER, Pa.
-Can the dream continue in
Collegeville? Apparently
the coaches and SIDs in the
Conference think so.
Ursinus, which won
its first-ever Conference
football championship in
1996, is the favorite to
repeat as Centennial
Conference football
champion in a poll of the
Conference's head coaches
and media. Each head

coach and Sports
Information Director from
each Conference locale
participated in the poll.
The Bears received
eight of a possible 15 first
place votes (voters were
not permitted to vote for
their own team) for 81
points to outdistance
Franklin & Marshall, which
was second with 66 points.
Ursinus returns 15 starters
and 59 lettermen from last
season's 9-2 team which

I¦s
3

was ousted in the NCAA
playoffs by Lycoming, 31
24. The Diplomats,
which finished second to
the Bears in the '96
standings, barely
outpointed Johns Hopkins
(64), Dickinson (63), and
Western Maryland (60), in
one of the closest preseason
ballotings in the
Conference's 15 year
history. F&M received
three first place votes,
while Western Maryland
picked up two. Johns
Hopkins and Dickinson
were on the top line in one
ballot apiece.

Gettysburg was
sixth with 49 points, while
Muhlenberg (22) and
Swathmore (15) rounded
out the field.
The Centennial
openers are set for Sept. 19
-20, when Gettysburg will
host Western Maryland.



Men s LaX struggles to put season behind them
Bullets fall to Washington after less than perfect sea son

From Staf fRepor ts
When the Gettys
burg College men's
lacrosse team lost three
consecutive games to
Salisbury State, Western
Maryland, and Washing
ton midway through the
season to fall to 5-4,- the
possibility that the
Bullets might miss the
NCAA Division III

tournament for the first
time since 1990 looked
very real.
Head Coach Hank
Janczyk's squad re
sponded by wining the
final five games of the
regular season, earning a
bid to the Division III
playoffs. In the first
round, Gettysburg
knocked off Salisbury
State in double overtime,

10-9. The Bullets' season
came to a close when
they fell to Washington
in the semifinals, 10-9.
"Every once in a
while I guess you have a
season that demonstrates
how certain cliches get

who has now logged 10
seasons as the head
coach at Gettysburg. "I
probably used phrases
like 'keep believing' and
'never give up' more
than I ever have before
as a coach. It must have
had some impact though,
because by the time our
season ended, we had
worked our way into
being one of the top four
Division III teams in the
country."

in
trouble

by Rebecca Babbitt
The Tau Kappa Epsilon house was set for renovations
this summer, but a few brothers decided to start early by caus
ing up to $50,000 worth of damage to the house on the last
two days of exams last May.
Now the house is closed and the brothers who dam
aged the house are being sued by TKE nationals.
The Psi chapter of TKE, founded at Gettysburg in 1926,
is "still operating as a fraternity, just with out housing," said
Jason Gareis, President of the Interfraternity Council.
It was rumored that the TKE brothers were being
housed at the Gettysburg Seminary. "Not true," said Gareis,

Editor's Note This Is part one of a continuing story Mora next week ¦

"Most of them are living off campus."
The decision to close the house was made by the
TKE alumni and national corporation. After the damage
had been assessed, the TKE housing corporation decided
to close the house for a semester.
"The house is not livable," said Gareis.
Renovations are planned for spring semester, and
brothers should be living in the house again by the fall of
1998. Current brothers will have to undergo a re-admit
tance process which includes interviews conducted by
alumni.
"This adds pressure from sources that had negative
ideas about the greek system," said Gareis. "It's fuel for
the fire."
"We're going to have to work hard to get more posi
tive publicity," said Gareis.

News Editor
At the close of the 1996
1997 academic year, Gettysburg
College chose to recognize mem
bers of the College's faculty with
awards for distinguished teaching.
Presented annually at the
College's commencement exer
cises, the Gettysburg College
award for Distinguished Teaching
was shared by two faculty mem
bers. The 1997 co-recipients of the
award were Professor of Chemis
try, Alex Rowland, and Professor
of English and Director of Theater
Arts, Emile Schmidt.
In recognizing Professor
Rowland, Gettysburg College Pro
vost Dan DeNicola said "Profes
sor Rowland has always been com
mitted to quality in undergraduate
science teaching, helping develop
the Organic Chemistry Test Form
for the Examination Committee of
the American Chemistry Society
and publishing several papers in
the Journal of Chemical Educa-

He continued, "By his ex
ample, Alex Rowland has shown
his students and younger col
leagues that one can do important
research of scientific significance
at a small liberal arts college."
DeNicola went on to say that
"Alex's name is synonymous with
Chemistry at Gettysburg College."
The Provost also recog
nized professor Schmidt, saying
"Emile's gift for making the world
of theater come to life in a practi
cal and imaginative fashion has
had a powerful and long-lasting
impact on the lives of his stu¬

dents." He stated that "Time and
again, individuals would rise to
make enthusiastic testimony to
Emile's teaching and his ability to
challenge them in pursuing their
life's goals."
Dr. Rowland earned his doc
torate from Brown University. He
began teaching at Gettysburg in
1958. In 1982, he was named
OCkershausen Professor of Chem
istry. Professor Schmidt earned his
Master's degree from Columbia
University. He began teaching at
Gettysburg in 1962. Along weith
his wife, Partricia Martell, he
founded the Gettysburg Summer
Theater, which ran for twenty-five

years. In addition to Professors
Rowland and Schmidt, Assistant
Professor of Biology, Veronique
Delesalle, received the Luther
W.and Bernice L. Thompson dis
tinguished Teaching award at the
Spring Honors Day program on
May 17. The award is given an
nually to a faculty member who
has come to Gettysburg College
within the past seven years and
whose teaching is recognized as
outstanding by faculty Colleagues.
Dr. Delesalle earned both
her bachelor's adn master's degrees
from McGill University. She lives
in Fairfield.





Beware the dangers of binge drinking

College Press Service
Jennifer, a Northwestern
University Junior, doesn't recall
how she ended up at Evanston
Hospital one early morning during
Spring Quarter last year. The last
thing she remembered was doing
tequila shots with a guy she met at
a fraternity party, and then her
world turned black.
Jennifer had a blood alcohol
level of about .21, more than twice
the legal limit in Illinois, and was
unconscious when friends took her
to Evanston Hospital's emergency
room. Her breathing was irregu
lar, and her friends told her that she
looked like a ghost.
"I was so scared," Jennifer
says as she shakes her head and
looks at the floor. "It was one of
the worst moments of my life. I
thought I was having such a good

GCPR A Gettysburg College ad
ministrator has co-written the first
book dedicated to examining the
history and significance of Devil's
Den in the Civil War Battle of Get
tysburg.
Garry E. Adelman, a life
long students of Civil War history,
has co-written "Devil's Den: A
History and Guide" with Timothy
H. Smith. The book was published
in June by Gettysburg-based Tho
mas publications. Both Adelman
and Smith are licensed guides for
the Gettysburg National Military

photo by _Mt* _Astrom
Park. Our goal in writing this book
was to bring to Devil's Den the
attention ft deserves as a promi
nent, but often overlooked, part of
the three-day battle," said
Adelman.
The book details the history
and folklore surrounding the site,
covers in-depth the events during
the battle, and concludes with a
detailed guide for visitors.
Adelman joined Gettysburg
College in 199S as part of the
College's dining services opera
tion.

time, and then I wake up in the
hospital with a needle in my arm."
Doctors had to hook Jenni
fer up to an IV to dilute her blood
quickly and lower her blood alco
hol content. Jennifer, who doesn't
want her last name used, says the
experience changed her life be
cause she is one of the lucky ones.
She is still alive.
At least 800 high school and
college students died from alcohol
poisoning in 1994, but researchers
think the number might be higher
than 4,000 because many deaths
related to alcohol may be attributed
to other causes like cardiac arrest,
according to Students Against
Drunk Driving.
Annann Hong, an alcohol
substance abuse educator at NU's
Searle Student Health Service.

isn't surprised to learn about
Jennifer's experience. She often
hears of drunk students who are
found in odd places on campus,
then shipped into Evanston Hos
pital for care.
A recent survey conducted
by the American Medical Associa
tion showed that 40 percent of 800
eighteen to thirty-year olds drink
to levels that impair judgment and
physical performance.
The results demonstrate a
sad, unconscionable waste of tal
ent and potential by our country's
young people," says Nancy
Dickey, chair ofAMA's board of
trustees.
Although many people mis
take alcohol for a stimulant be
cause it can make people more

lively than their usual selves, al
cohol is actually a depressant. If a
person drinks enough alcohol it
can shut the body's immune sys
tem down and affect the circula
tory and respiratory systems.
Hong points out that many
people don't know that alcohol
alone can kill you, and you don't
have to be into the driver's seat to
die from it.
"People are afraid of taking
someone into the hospital because
of the possible consequences, or
they think that the person is passed
out and will be OK in the morn
ing," Hong says. "But this is seri
ous and instead of worrying about
the person getting in trouble, I
think it's more important that you
could be saving that person's life."

A SADD brochure lists sev
eral cases in which young adults
have died from alcohol poisoning,
including a story about Marie
Brinkmeyer. She was 18 and a
first-year student at Texas A&M
University when she bought a
bottle of tequila and took it to a
dormitor party. After drinking
heavily, Brinkmeyer collapsed adn
was carried to her bed to sleep it
off. She never woke up.
"I don't think people are
aware of all the damage alcohol
can do," says Dr. David Barthwell,
medical director for the drug and
alcohol program at Northwestern
Memorial Hospital in Chicago.
"Alcohol companies make alcohol
look so appealing, but the truth is,
if you aren't careful, it can kill
you."

Involvement, participation required for success, says Nordvall
Dean of First Year Students urges new arrivals to get involved

GCPR When students first come
to college, the number of pos
sible activities to join is over
whelming. In addition, there is
the academic challenge of col
lege courses, dean of First Year
Students, Robert Nordvall, rec
ommends that students take their
time reviewing the options avail
able and deciding the activities
in which they want to participate
at Gettysburg, but he notes that
first year students should become
involved in the life of the Col
lege. A leading scholar on
the affect that college has upon
students is Dr. Alexander W.
Austin of the Cooperative Insti
tutional Research Program at

UCLA. Dr. Astin os an alumnus of
Gettysburg College. His work indi
cates that the quality of the educa
tional experience that students get in
college is directly related to how
much they are involved both inside
and outside the classroom in their
college experience. Not surpris
ingly, students who put more effort
into college, receive much greater
benefits from their four years of
higher education.
Dean Nordvall empha
sizes, however, that although almost
all activities provided benefits, not
all co-curricular activities are equal
in what they provide to students.
Students should look for activities
that provided to them strong oppor
tunities for personal growth. A small
group of activities that have proved
particularly powerful in fostering the

growth and development of stu
dents are the service learning pro
grams and community service pro
grams, and opportunities for inde
pendent study and research with
professors. There are activities
that students name as particularly
important as they reflect upon their
four years at Gettysburg. There
four are not the only activities that
play such a role, and students can,
of course, take part in a number of
very beneficial activities at the
College. The Gettysburg Is Volun
teering (GIV) Day activities on the
Monday afternoon of Orientation
from 6:30 pm - 8:00 pm there will
be an Open House at the Center
for Public Service at which stu
dents can find out more about com
munity service and service learn¬

ing programs. Study abroad op
portunities will be discussed in the
rotating discussion sessions on
Monday morning of Orientation.
First year students do not ordi
narily work on research and inde
pendent study projects with pro
fessors, but during their first year
students should be sampling the
various academic programs at the
College in order to find out which
programs offer the academic chal
lenges and opportunities that are
most attractive to them.
Service learning pro
grams, community service pro
grams, study abroad, and indepen
dent study and research are pow
erful experiencesbecause they
stretch students. They force stu
dents to do and see new things.

They force students to look at the
world differently. Students can
graduate from Gettysburg College
without participating in any of
these programs, but students who
want to experience the full range
of a Gettysburg College education
should select the best opportuni
ties that the College has to offer,
both inside and outside of the class
room.

Gardner garners safety award
College recognizes staff member's contribution

Terry R. Gardner, a car
penter in the facilities services
department at Gettysburg Col
lege, was recently presented the
Quarterly Safety Suggestion
Award by the College's Residen
tial and Workplace Safety Com
mittee. A resident of Gettys

mitting the best safety suggestion
for the first three months of 1997.
Gardner's suggestion, that the
steps for entering and exiting the
bucket on a bucket truck be re
designed to provide safer access,
was judged to be the best of the
16 suggestions submitted for the
quarter. Gardner received a $50

Gettysburg: A Beginner s Guide

"I'll meet you in fif
teen minutes at Stine Lake and
we can head over to Servo. Or
maybe we can just go to LD's,
but first I have to swing over to
the CUB and hit the MAC."
Your friend just called
and left this message on you
answering machine. You've
been here for less than a week,
so naturally you think, "what is
he talking about?" Have no fear,
new student, because this handy
litle glossary of Gettysburg
speak is sure to get you through
these social straits unscathed
and sounding like an old 'Burg
pro. First things first. "Where
am I now?" and "You want me
to go where?"

Servo: a.k.a. the Din
ing Hall. Probably nicknamed
back when the college's dining
service was contracted out to a
company called Servomation
(eons ago). Anyhow, you eat
here. Tip: Get here early on
Premium Entree Night. The
Cordon Bleu rules.
CUB: a.k.a. The Col
lege Union Building. Here you
will find the mailroom, school
store, ballroom, first-year stu
dent laundry room and the cam
pus alternative to Servo, Cafe

101. The Junction (for -
merly known as the Dive):
This is a place that studetn or
ganizations can hold meetings,
the Student Activities Council
has live performances and mov
ies, and where students can just
hang out. Cafe 101: a.k.a. the
Bullet Hole. Looking for a
quick snack while you're on the
run? Travel beyond the Junc
tion, past the mailroom, and
you're in The Hole. You have
$3.75 on you meal card that's
good for breakfast, lunch and
dinner. Remember, only two
prepackaged items per meal.
The catch to Cafe 101 is that
you can only use your meal

cards at specific hours: 8:00 -
10:15 am for breakfast, 1:30 -
4:00 pm for lunch, and 4:30 -
9:00 pm for dinner. However,
it stays open until midnight in
case you're in the mood for a
late night snack.
Mailroom: Every
weekday, between 11:30 am and
1 pm, the mailroom transforms
from a drab series of metal
boxes into the very epicenter of
social activity at Gettysburg
College. Here the evening's
plans are made, adn flirting is
perfected, check your mail,
two, three, four times a day!
MAC: a.k.a. Money
Access Center, this is an auto
mated teller machine outside the
CUB. It's the same as MOST,
Cirrus, or whatever you're used
to. This innocent-looking ma
chine cna be both a Friday night
life-saver and a Sunday morn
ing nightmare. Beware of the
lure of fast cash.

Mussdman Library:
It's Tuesday night and nothing's
going on. where can I go to
hang out and meet new people?
The Library is the answer. On
any given evening, the first
floors are filled with students
pretending to study while pick
ing up the lastest gossip on cam
pus. Plus, when you get home
and find that your parents have
called, you can honestly say that
you were at the library. But be
ing there and studying are two
entriely different issues. If you
really need to do some work, the

third adn fourth fllors are your
best bet. Night owls will be
happy to see that the library is
opne 24 hours a day. And for
those slaves to the almighty
bean, librarians brew coffee and
provide hot water for tea adn
cocoa for those students pulling
all-nighters. Also, the library
has three day/three movie video
rentals. They may not have all
the newest releases, but they do
have some of the best movies
ever made. The library is one
of the three "Mussleman" loca
tions on campus, the others be¬

ing Mussleman stadium, and If the phone rings once > it > s an
Mussleman Hall, located in the on.campus cal, and you can risk

Upperclass Quad.
Bream Wright
Hauser: This is the campus gym
adn field house. It's located be
yond the CUB adn across hte
street from the Apple apartments.
Be sure you don't confuse Bream
with the...
PlankGym: This older
gym is found between the CUB
and Masters Hall. There's a
games room adn fitness room in
the basement. WZBT, the col¬

lege radio station at 91.1 FM is
located in the basement. Make
some requests and bug the DJ by
dialing x6313. Many studetn or
ganizations also call Plank home,
including the Student Activites
office, GECO (enviornmental
concerns organization), the Black
Student Union, Student Senate,
the Gettysburgian, the Spectrum
(yearbook), and the IFC (Inter
fraternity Council), the Center
for Public Service is also in
Plank, but on the first floor.

Stine Lake: Not really
a lake at all, Stine Lake is actu
ally the open area between Plank
Gym and the library. One theory
for the origin of its odd name may
be that the field is known to flood
during heavy stroms. Almost
knee-deep water is not unusual
on the "lake." Afteranastystorm,
put on old clothes, go out, slide
around and have your own little
Woodstock.

BruaHalLKIine The
ater, and Stevens Theater:
These are all the same place and
for that reason, it can get rather
confusing.
Schmucker Hall: This
is the colege's art and music
building. Stop in and check out
the art gallery which is filled with
the work of your fellow
gettysburgians. Frequent recitals
and concerts there, too. and
they're free!
Other Important Stuff
OneRing/T woRings:

answering it with a more creative
greeting. If it has a double ring, it's
most likely Mom and shoudl be
anwered accordingly.
The Weather Guy(s):
There are two numbers you can cal to
get time adn hte local weather. These
numbers are helpful, but they can
becoem serious habits. You'll soon
find yourself calling them before you
walk across the hall. Anyway, here's
the spiel: 337-1234: Your basic com
puter guy with time and weather.
334-0505: Advanced system
run by the local newspaper, The Get
tysburg Time. This one gives you
options. Dial 1131 for a three day
forecast. You can also get daily horo
scopes, sports scores and dirt on the
day's soaps.

Menu line: By dialing
MENU (6368), you cna get the day's
selections at Servo. However, if the
line is busy, you can access their web
site at http://
dining.www.gettysburg.edu.
The WorldOutThereBe
yondtliecollege Within Walking Distance
Lincoln Diner: a.k.a LD's.
It's 3:15 am and the rest of your world
is fast asleep. Grab aconsciousamigo
and hit the diner. A plethora of tasty

burgers, sinful desserts and colorful
late night patrons are sure to be on
hand to keep you entertained. Try the
beef gravy on the fries. It rules.
Pizza, pizza, pizza: Each
with its own pros adn cons, the
gettysburg area has many pizza places
but only threee deliver - Piza House,
Little Ceasar's and Dominos. If you
have the ways and means (i.e. a car),
Stavros Pizza in Emmitsburg, just
over the Maryladn line, is well worth
the trip.

Ernie's Texas Lunch: Lo
cated across Chambersburg Street
from K&K Records, Ernie's has been
catering to the lunch adn dinner
crowds of Gettysburg for three gen
erations. An "Ernie Dog" is not to be
missed, and for those vegetarians out
there, Ernies offers "The Dummy" - a
hot dog bun, all your favorite hot dog
toppings, but no hot dog. Ernie's is
the perfect place for thoese looking to

spend under $5 and not go awaty
feeling hungry.
Seven Eleven: Oh thank
Heaven! Located on the corner of
North Washington and
Chambersburg streets, S'leven is
the perfect place to satisfy any of
a student's cravings. Whether your
personal vice is nicotine, caffeine,

College receives grant for Civil War Studies program
Luce Professorship to begin in 1999

GCPR Gettysburg College has
been awarded a grant of more than
$500,000 from the Henry Luce
Foundation to support the estab
lishment of a professorship in
Civil War studies. The Henry R.
Luce Professor of the Civil War
Era will lead an undergraduate
program in Civil War studies and
will develop and direct "The Get
tysburg Semester," a program se
lecting students from across the
country to participate in a semes
ter of intensive interdisciplinary
study of the Civil War era.
Funds from the grant,
which covers an initial period of
six years, will be used primarily
to provide salary and benefits for
a faculty member chosen to fill the
Luce Professorship. The grant
was announced by the
Foundation's Chairman Henry
Luce III. The Luce Professor will
be selected by a committee at the
College after completion of a na¬

tional search.
The recipient's appoint
ment will be made in 1998, and the
Luce Professor will begin teaching
at Gettysburg by the fall of 1999.
Gettysburg is one of only
tow higher education institutions to
receive a professorship from the
Luce Foundation during this year.
The other was Johns Hopkins Uni
versity. "Gettysburg College is
very grateful for the support of the
Luce Foundation which will allow
us an opportunity to develop great
strength in Civil War studies, we
sincerely believe that we can de
velop a program unmatched at any
other site in the country," said Gor
don Haaland, president of Gettys
burg College. "Our aim is to use
of existing relationships with the
community of Civil War scholars
and our natural geographic connec
tion with the pivotal battle of that
War to establish an integrated first-

rate undergraduate program that
allows not only our students but
also visiting students access to a
unique combination of scholarship
and original research materials."
"Many of the basic issues
of contemporary American society
came into focus during the Civil
War era, among those being the
relevance of race in a democracy,
the proper balance of federal and
state government, the principles
that bind Americans, the meaning
of a union. We think that a
multidisciplinary examination of
the Civil War era is a wonderful,
rich, and sound way to examine
our social fabric," said Dr. Daniel
DeNicola, the college's chief aca
demic officer.
"The professorship will
provide scholarly leadership for an
intensive program in this era, ad
dressing not only the causes and
events of the Civil War and its af
termath, but its cultural and intel¬

lectual milieu. The program will
draw on not only miliary and po
litical history, but, among many,
the fields of economics, sociology,
philosophy, African-american
studies, women's studies, rhetoric,
religion, literature, the visual arts,
and music. Such a study helps us
understand what was changed and
what was preserved by the war,
what was lost and gained," added
DeNicola.
The Henry R. Luce Pro
fessorship Program wa established
in 1969 by the New York-based
foundation to encourage academic
innovation and creativity through
integrative and interdisciplinary
approaches to teaching and re
search in American private higher
education.
The first recipient of the
Luce Professorship in Civil War
Studies will be responsible for fur
ther developing existing College
curricular programs into an aca¬

demic concentration or minor pro
gram, with direct responsibility for
teaching the introductory and
capstone courses in that program.
By the third year of the grant, the
Luce Professor will develop and
the direct "The Gettysburg Semes
ter," for which up to 25 under
graduate students will be selected
from applicants across the coun
try for a one-semester, integrated
program of Civil War studies.
"We will continue to sup
port the Luce Professor, the estab
lished Gettysburg program, and
the Gettysburg Semester upon the
completion of the six-year Luce
grant period," said DeNicola.
"The college has the option of ap
plying to the Luce Foundation for
three additional years of support,
and we are confident that our pro
grams will show sufficient
progress and strength to warrant
serious consideration."

College receives Kline Grant

$200,000 awarded for renovation of Carlisle House

GCPR Gettysburg College has re
ceived a grant of $200,000 from
the Josiah W. and Bessie H. Kline
Foundation, Inc., which will be
used to partially fund renovations
to a residence facility for students
dedicated to addressing issues re
lating to wellness and healthy
lifestyles.
The grant will be paid in
equal installments during a five
year period by the Harrisburg
based charitable foundatio. The
renovation project, which will in
clude interior and exterior im
provements, along with a overhaul
of the mechanical and electrical
systems of the building, will be
gin this summer and will be com
pleted next summer.
"The continuing generous
support of the Kline Foundation
will enable Gettysburg College to
accelerate the completion of a sig¬

nificant renovation.," said Gordon
A. Haaland, president of Gettys
burg. "The concept of specialty
housing, in general, and this
wellness house, in particular, em
body a critical aspect of a Gettys
burg education, that of combining
classroom learning with students'
cocurricular activities and social
activism."
The studen t housing unit to
be renovated, the Carlisle House,
is one of IS specialty housing units
established by the College to allow
students with shared interests an
opportunity to pursue their goals in
a common residence.
The Carlisle House was es
tablished in 1990 as a result of stu
dent requests. Students choosing
to reside in the building commit to
planning three programs each se
mester which focus the attention of
the campus community on

wellness, including issues of sub
stance abuse.
The Kline Foundation was
established in 1952 exclusively for
charitable, scientific, literary and
educational purposes.
Both Josiah and Bessie
Kline served at one time as trust
ees of Gettysgburg College. The
foundation has supported previous
projects at the College involving
the construction of the Mussleman
Library and new athletic complex,
and the renovation of facilities for
the theater program and one of the
College's original buildings. A
scholarship fund named in honor
of Joseph Simpson, a former presi
dent of the foundation and College
trustee, has also been established
at Gettysburg.

Eddie Plank's birthday bash sure to hit a home run Sunday

by Paul Hutchinson
Contributing Writer
This Sunday, August 31,
Gettysburg College will be cel
ebrating the birthday of one of its
own: Baseball Hall of Famer
Eddie Plank. The organizations
housed in Plank Gymnasium,
named for the old southpaw (in
layman's terms, a left handed
pitcher), have joined together to
honor our hometown hero, wel
come old friends and new, and
have themselves a party!
Born on August 31, 1875,
Plank practiced pitching by hurl
ing balls at bales of hay at his farm
north of town. By 1900, he was
playing for the Gettysburg College
Battlefields, and in 1901, the first
year of the American League, he

was pitching for the Philadelphia
Athletics.
Every year from 1903 until
his retirement in 1917, Plank had
— T7D A -._f I_^_nn
ivn ui i

Browns.
Plank retired in 1917 with a
326-194 record, 69 shutouts, and

_„
an _x_^_ca_»
than 3.00. He
played in the
1905 World Se
ries against the
New York Gi
ants, then again
in rematches in
1911 and 1913

What: Party
When: Sunday At 6pm
Where: Plank Gym

In 1915, I
he left the Athletics for St. Louis
and the new Federal League, but
after a 21-11 season, the league
dissolved. Plank went across town
for the 1916 season and finished
his career with the St. Louis

a 2.35 ERA, giving up fewer walks
than any other pitcher with over
4,000 innings of work. After his
years in the majors, Eddie came
back to Gettysburg, opened a ga
rage in town and even lived in the

of college, making Gettysburg
College the only college men
tioned in the Hall of Fame.
Eddie Plank's baseball card
is one of the rarest baseball cards
of all time. Rumor also has it that

am
house now occupied by Phi Sigma
Kappa. He died of a stroke in 1926
and was inducted into the Baseball
Hall of Fame twenty

There are some
interesting facts con
cerning Eddie Plank.
Although not a gradu
ate of the College,
Eddie's plaque in
Cooperstown refers
to his roots in Adams
County stating that he
was recruited just out

he was the first pitcher to throw a
curveball, but this issue has been
debated for decades.
"Gettysburg Eddie's" birth
day party will begin at 6 pm on
Sunday in the basement of Plank.
Along with cake and ice cream,
compliments of Kilwins, all of the
organizations will leave their doors
open. These organizations include
WZBT, the school radio station;
GECO, the environmental club;
the Spectrum, the yearbook; and
the Gettysburgian. So come by on
Sunday evening, and wish Eddie
a very happy birthday, wherever he
is.

"Cotton" the act

Student band rocks Junction to packed house

byBarbDickson FeatuKS Editor
The Junction pumped with
music Sunday night, as many up
perclassmen spent their first nights
back on campus dancing the night
away. Cotton Roberts performed to
a large crowd for two hours, intro
ducing the first year students to the
Junction and getting upperclass
men back into the swing of things.
Cotton Roberts is a five per
son band, three of whom have at
tended Gettysburg College. The
band began this summer when Jon
Pistey, who graduated in May, and
Nate Bowen, '98, got together and
decided to form a band.
According to Bowen, Pistey
asked if he wanted to be in a band,
and Bowen gave a noncommittal
answer. Eventually, though, it be
came less of a "whatever" answer
and more of a definite plan.

They were joined by current
senior Chris Paumi and Chris Fos
ter, a friend of Pistey's from
Greece. It was only recently that
Jen Knight, the lead singer, joined
the group.
"We wanna rock," says

Pistey of the group. Cotton Rob
erts, he explained, was a character
in a Willie Nelson movie called
Honeysuckle Rose. The character
was a "total cheeseball" and
mocked by the other characters in
the film. The band liked the idea
and chose that for the name.
The band started at 10 to a
packed house, which fluctuated
throughout the evening. There
was, however, always a number of
people in the front, dancing to the
loud, pounding music.
"It was a lot of fun to dance
to," commented sophomore Krissi
Fisher. "A great way to meet out
going first-years." There were
some of these brave first year stu
dents in the front, dancing away
with the upperclassmen.
Cotton Roberts is the first
band to play the Junction this
school year. They were quickly
followed by blues artist K. J. James
on Wednesday afternoon, and this
Saturday night with the first Cof
feehouse of the year.

The band's music consisted
of both original music and classics
such as "Bad Moon on the Rise"
and "Old Time Rock V Roll."

which ended the evening. "Don't
ask for an encore," said Pistey, "be
cause you're not going to get one."
Pistey made comments
throughout the night As a recent
graduate, he remarked, "I'm
amused to be up here...Four years
ago I was down there," gesturing
to where the audience sat. Pistey
now works in the basement of the
library.
Everyone at the Junction
seemed to be enjoying the band.
"The vocalist was excellent," com
mented sophomore Christine
Sedlacko. "[She had a] great
voice." To make this even more
impressive is the fact that Knight,
the lead singer, only joined the
group a few weeks ago.
Cotton Roberts is a band in
transition, however. Both the
drummer, Foster, and Bowen are
not able to be in the band any
longer, so Pistey is again looking
for the musically inclined to join
his band.

.The fate of the band is yet
to be sealed, but they did their job
Sunday night: the Junction rocked.
And that's just what Pistey wanted.



Previews mislead, but this "Theory" is worth the proof

by Jon Fr oehhch
StaffWriter "I don't know what I know,
but I know it's big." - Jerry
Fletcher Though the television pre
views for "Conspiracy Theory,"
starring two of Hollywood's best
looking and well known faces Mel
Gibson (Lethal Weapon, Mad
Max) and Julia Robers (Pretty
Woman, The Pelican Brief), give
viewers the stereotypical appear
ance of an action movie, this illu
sion is forgotten not long into the
movie.
The previews show scenes
that, though indeed from the
movie, seem to be taken totally out
of context. Perhaps these scenes
of car chases andSWAT team
sieges are what draw many audi
ences to the theater, but it is easy
to forget what one expected to see

because of the way this clever, ex
citing, and only semi-action movie
is presented.
Although a misrepresenta
tion of a movie in its previews is
usually a sign that it has something
to hide, audiences will most likely
be pleasantly surprised by this new
film from director Richard Donner
(Superman, The Goonies).
Jerry Fletcher, played by
Gibson, is a New York taxi driver
whoisabitofaheadcase. Though
some might insist that New York
cabbies are nuts by definition,
Fletcher is definitely a special case.
This character seems to
bring out the best in Gibson be
cause he both gives him a chance
to do some real acting and because
Gibson's natural charm and humor
gives the fictional Jerry Fletcher
the human touch that audiences
crave.

By the time the movie starts,
Fletcher is already in the midst of
a rather one-sided relationship that
borders on stalking with govern
ment worker Alice Sutton, played
with heart by Julia Roberts.
In accordance with the title,
Jerry is convinced that everything
is a government cover-up and is
trying to alert the public through
his newsletter: Conspiracy Theory.
He is the kind of guy who doesn't
trust anyone - except Alice Sutton.
Sutton understandably
doesn't believe Fletcher and is a
little annoyed with his ravings
about such things as sperm
samples from the fathers of Nobel
Prize winners being stored under
the ice at Rockefeller Center. How
ever, her internal kindness won't
permit her to watch Jerry get
locked up or to stop Jerry from
growing on her.

The plot of Conspiracy
Theory really gets moving when
what the viewer suspected all
along is revealed to be true: Jerry
is paranoid for goodreason. This
reason is personified by the su
premely evil Doctor Jonas, played
perfectly by Patrick Stewart (Star
Trek - the Next Generation, Robin
Hood: Men in Tights). Though
Jerry is convinced that he is being
chased because his newsletter has
hit a nerve with the government,
Jonas is in pursuit of Jerry for a
reason left unknown to audiences
until the end of the movie.
Conspiracy Theory marks
another success in the vast collec
tion belonging to acclaimed direc
tor Richard Donner. Donner, hav
ing previously worked with
Gibson on both the Western com
edy Maverick and all three install
ments of the police action trilogy

Lethal Weapon, seems to have ac
quired both the skill of utilizing
Gibson to his fullest potential as
well as that of making an exciting
movie with a balanced combina
tion of action, drama, and humor;
all three are abundant in Con
spiracy Theory.
The only gripe one could
possibly have with this movie is
that the ending is, for the lack of a
more descriptive word, cheesy.
But the fact remains that many
people, though they won't be quick
to admit it, like cheesy stuff. We
see plenty of reality every day.
Part of the reason we go to the
movies is for a change - and that's
OK. Conspiracy Theory wasn't
afraid to give audiences what they
want. This fact plus great casting
and a gripping plot make Con
spiracy Theory one of the few truly
good movies to come out this
summer.

Suspense movie will
make you Scream

byBarbDickson Features Editor
The movie Scream opened
last winter to critical acclaim and
high popularity. The latest movie
from Wes Craven, the director of
the horror classic Nightmare on
Elm Street, was an almost instant
hit. The story is that of a small
town in California, Santa Rosa. It
focuses on the lives of a group of
five students who attend
Woodsboro High School. The
main character is Sidney (Neve
Campbell), whose mother was
murdered almost a year before the
action in the movie takes place.

Her life is once
again disrupted
as two of her
classmates are
brutally mur
dered one night,
and the killer
then focuses on
Sidney. She
doesn't know

who to trust and who not to trust.
And the body count just keeps ris
ing. The plot sounds like that of
a typical horror movie. There is a
wonderful twist, though. It's a
horror movie about teens who
grew up watching horror movies.
They know all of the cliches, and
Sidney's friend Randy (Jamie
Kennedy) tells us "the rules": how
to survive a horror movie. At a
party, as the group watches a hor
ror movie, Randy lists them for us:

-Don t answer the phone
-Don't open the door
-Don't have sex
-Don't drink or do drugs
-Don't go back in the house
-Don't hide in the closet
-Don't just stand there
-Don't trip

-Don't say "I'll be right
back," because you won't be
The list goes on. There are
also numerous references to other
movies, and a comment is made
at one point about a horror movie
director named Wes Carpenter
(combining Craven's name with
that of John Carpenter, another
horror director).
The movie is highly enter
taining and keeps you guessing
throughout. It isn't until the very
end that you have any idea who
the killer could be. The ending

was done wonderfully, with shock
and suspense mixed powerfully to
gether.
The cast was perfect, though
Skeet Ulrich (Last Dance, The
Craft) as Billy, Sidney's boy
friend, was a little too reminiscent
of Johnny Depp's character in A
Nightmare on Elm Street.
Campbell was perfect as the al
most perfect Sidney. While there
was an element of the audience
wanting to protect her, there was
also a feeling that she could take
care of herself.
That is part of what makes
Scream such a great movie. In
many horror movies, you almost
want the charac
ters to be killed
because they are
viivmiw

CY\ 1
"Do you
like scary
movies?"-

uvvuuuv r
sostupid. In this
movie the char
acters are not
dumb; after all,
they grew up on
this stuff. In
stead of con
stantly saying to

yourself, "What an idiot!", you'll
be saying, "Great idea!" These

characters know how to think for
themselves.
Cameos are made by Drew
Barrymore as Casey, the killer's
first victim, and Henry Winkler as
Mr. Himbry, the school principal.
It is the killing of Casey that brings
us into the story and gives us a hint
of what is to come: as the killer
talks to her on the phone, he quiz
zes her on such movies as Friday
the 13th and Halloween.
Courtney Cox is also in the
cast as Gale, a local television
news reporter always trying to get

the story first. You love to hate
her, though you might just change
your mind later on.
There is a sequel already in
the works, though it makes you
wonder whether Scream will turn
into another Friday the 13th with
a string of horrible sequels.
This is a movie that keeps
you on your toes the whole way
through. The script was brilliantly
(as much as you can use that word
to describe a horror movie) writ
ten by Kevin Williamson. The
conclusion of it comes as a shock.

If you like horror movies, this is a
definite must-see.
Note: Scream will be play
ing tonight outside of Plank Gym
or inside the Junction if it rains.

nice enough to give me a cr edit
card and unlimited access to my
chargeaccountatthebookstor &
While I know that its ther efor
emergency purposes, I am
scar ed that I will star t to go

do you have so that I don't
charge too much?

Sincerely,
Charged Up
Dear Charged Up,
First, you must realize
that having a charge account is a
right, not a privledge. In essence,
it is a step towards that ingima
many refer to as reality. Being
afraid of going charge crazy is
probaly not uncommon among
college students because of the
ease in which that piece of plastic
makes buying all those
"neccessary items." Here are some
tips that might keep you from go
ing overboard and into the ocean
of debt. First, never charge
anyhting that you could easily pay
for with the good old green. Sec
ond, never charge anything that
you know that you, nor your par
ents can easliy pay off. For ex
ample, the book store can be
tempting because of it's enticing
array of clothing. It would probaly

be kosher to charge an occasional
item, but do not plan to do your
entire winter wardrobe shopping in
the bookstore's clothing depart
ment. Lastly, always think to your
self, "is this absolutley, and
complely neccessary?". If your
answer is a maybe, go home, think
about it, even discuss it with your
parents, and if you decide you still
want the item, come back the next
day. I can almost guarentee it will
still be there. Utilizing these tips
will definitly help to keep your
charge account down, and you and
your parents happy campers.
Dear Casey,
I'masophmor e, and
last year my best friend and I
decidedtolivetogether . We've
been her efor a week and she' s
driving me up a wall. I don't
want to lose her as a friend, but
Ican'tKvewhhher ,whatshould
Ido? Thanks,
New Roomate Needed

Pear New Roomate Needed,
This seems to be one of
those curve balls life tends to throw
at us. You think to yourself, "what
could b better than living with my
best friend?" Well, often a lot. In
being best friends you know a lot
about each others tendencies, and
some may even urk you, but be
fore this year you could retreat to

your room and she to hers if things
got sticky. Now this is no longer
the case. Most likely you and your
best friend do a lot of things
togehter, eat breakfast, go to some
of the same classes, eat lunch, go
to the same activities, eat dinner
together, ect. And then, after a long
period of togetherness, you go
home, well, together. This is a time
bomb just waiting to explode. Too
much togehterness cna lead to a lot
of aggravation and sometimes
heartache. You and your best
friend need to sit down and have a
heart to heart NOW. If the prob
lem persists, it will only get worse,
and could cause a serious hiatus in

the relationship.
You are concerned about
loosing her as a friend. Listen up.
Tell it to her straight, but not cru
elly. Say, "look roomie, I love you
dearly but your stepping on my
toes and it is starting to hurt." Lay
all the cards on the table and get
her feedback. You might be sur
prised by her reaction, YOU might
actually be driving her up a wall
as well. A true friend will be pa
tient, listen and respond in a way
that will probaly bring you two
closer. Lastly, have faith in your
friendship. Good friends are few
and far between, and sometimes in
order to get close to someone you
might actually have to move apart.

Women's tennis ends season second in conference

From Staff Reports
Junior Kate Goodall
and sophomore Bev Jack
son emerged as the leading
players on Gettysburg
College's 1997 women's
tennis team.
Gettysburg completed
the regular season with a
14-2 record and was 8-2 in
the Centennial Conference,
good for second place. The
Bullets were the defending
conference champs.
Goodall, playing out
of the number six singles
post most of the season,
recorded a 14-1 record.
Jackson, who handled the
number five spot through
out the season, was 14-2
for the year.

Goodall and Jackson
formed Gettysburg's top
number three doubles team
and were also the team
leaders in that area. They
posted a 13-1 record, the
second best in the Centen
nial Conference.
However, the season's
top honor went to the
Bullets' number two
singles player, senior
Cynthia Hoenes. Hoenes
not only made the All
Centennial Conference first

team, but was named
co-player of the year, along
with Johns Hopkins' Zeena
Abdi. Hoenes posted a 13
3 record.
Hoenes, one of only
two seniors on this year's
team, completes her colle
giate career with a stunning
54-13 singles record and a
48-10 doubles mark for an
overall 102-23 record.
Hoenes was joined by
junior Tara Schmitt to form
Gettysburg's number one
doubles team. They were
14-2 on the season and
were named to the all
conference first team.
They won their first seven
matches to end the season
with 14 wins.

Hoenes not only
proved to be a strong
competitor on the court, but
in the classroom as well.
She and senior Mary Joy
Troxel were named to the
Centennial Conference's
academic honor roll for
carrying a 3.40 GPA or
better.
Gettysburg completed

its sixth season under head
coach Bill Pfitzinger this
Spring. The Bullets are 66
21 under his guidance.

ence championship and

Strong starting lineup, Streeter's 20th make for promising season

FromStaf f Repor ts
Not only will
Gettysburg College be
launching its 105th football
season this year, but Head
Coach Barry Streeter will
begin his 20th year at the
Bullet helm. It all began
Monday when 93
candidates reported for the
first day of pre-season
drills. Streeter is currently
the college's all-time
coaching leader with 108
victories, 80 losses and five
draws. His best season was
1985 when he guided the
Bullets through their only
undefeated regular season

and eventually completed
the year with a 11-1-1 slate
following a semi-final
placing in the NCAA
Division III playoffs.
Streeter added three
new coaches to his staff of
eight. Steve Reider, a 1995
Dickinson graduate, and
Tom Waranavage, a 1993
Muhlenberg grad, have
been assigned to the wide
receivers and tight ends
respectively. The new
outside linebacker coach is
Marty Ogle, a 1974
graduate of Sheperd.
Among the 93
candidates Streeter will
greeted on Sunday were 49

freshmen and 44
upperclassmen, including
31 letter winners. Heading
the list is sophomore Paul
Smith. Smith, a first team
all-centennial conference
fullback as a freshman,
rushed 888 yards and
scored nine touchdowns in
1996. He has been named
on of USA III Football's
top sophomores to watch ii
1997. Leading the Bullets
in 1997 will be elected
captains Joe Hodakowski
and Rob Sena.
Hodakowski is a senior
linebakcer while Sena is a
senior defensive back.

The one nice thing
facing Streeter is the fact
that he has a solid starting
veteran at every position
except offensive left guard.
With an offensive line
intact, backed by an
experienced backfield, the
Bullets could unleash a
potent offense. Veterans
Chris Fugaro and Wes
Wells are back at
quarterback while veterans
Matt Helwig and Donny
McNellis will be at the
halfback slots. Joining
Smith at the fullback slot
will be another veteran,
Henry Unger, as well as the
return of Dan Sheats.

Sheats took a year off last
season for personal
reasons, after rushing for
273 yards and one
touchdown in five games as
a freshman in 1995.
The Bullets spent
the first two days going
through physicals,

-Can the dream continue in
Collegeville? Apparently
the coaches and SIDs in the
Conference think so.
Ursinus, which won
its first-ever Conference
football championship in
1996, is the favorite to
repeat as Centennial
Conference football
champion in a poll of the
Conference's head coaches
and media. Each head
coach and Sports
Information Director from
each Conference locale
participated in the poll.

The Bears received
eight of a possible 15 first
place votes (voters were
not permitted to vote for
their own team) for 81
points to outdistance
Franklin & Marshall, which
was second with 66 points.
Ursinus returns 15 starters
and 59 lettermen from last
season's 9-2 team which

was ousted in the NCAA
playoffs by Lycoming, 31
24. The Diplomats,
which finished second to
the Bears in the '96
standings, barely
outpointed Johns Hopkins
(64), Dickinson (63), and
Western Maryland (60), in
one of the closest preseason
ballotings in the
Conference's 15 year
history. F&M received
three first place votes,
while Western Maryland
picked up two. Johns
Hopkins and Dickinson
were on the top line in one
ballot apiece.
Gettysburg was
sixth with 49 points, while
Muhlenberg (22) and
Swathmore (15) rounded
out the field.
The Centennial
openers are set for Sept. 19

host Western Maryland.



Men's LaX struggles to put season behind them
Bullets fall to Washington after less than perfect sea son

FromStaf fRepor ts
When the Gettys
burg College men's
lacrosse team lost three
consecutive games-to
Salisbury State, Western
Maryland, and Washing
ton midway through the
season to fall to 5-4, the
possibility that the
Bullets might miss the
NCAA Division III
tournament for the first
time since 1990 looked
very real.
Head Coach Hank
Janczyk's squad re
sponded by wining the
final five games of the
regular season, earning a
bid to the Division III

playoffs. In the first
round, Gettysburg
knocked off Salisbury
State in double overtime

10-9. The Bullets' season
came to a close when
they fell to Washington
in the semifinals, 10-9.
"Every once in a
while I guess you have a
season that demonstrates
how certain cliches get
started," said Janczyk,
who has now logged 10
seasons as the head
coach at Gettysburg. "I
probably used phrases
like 'keep believing' and
'never give up' more ¦
than I ever have before
as a coach. It must have

had some impact though_,
because by the time our
season ended, we had
worked our way into
being one of the top four
Division III teams in the
country."

The Bullets had
four seniors in their
starting lineup for the
two playoff games, three
of them at the midfield.
Brett Strait closed
out his four years at

the Bullets with 31 goals Gettysburg by scoring 26

and 10 assists.
Strait and
Feldman both made the
first unit of the 1997

ence Men's Lacrosse

goals and dishing out 20
assists during the Bullets'
1997 campaign.
Joe Feldman was
runner-up on the team in
goals scored. He furnished

ream. Andrew Nesbitt had
16 goals to go along with
13 assists.
The fourth senior in
the starting lineup was
defenseman James
Gohng. A three year
starter for the Bullets, he
also made the all-confer
ence firstteam.
Junior attackman
Jamie Bateman secured
the scoring title for 1997
with a five-goal perfor
mance against Washing
ton in the Division HI
semifinals. He con
cluded the season with
37 goals and seven
assists, and made the all
conference squad as an
honorable mention.

Scott Lowery joined
Strait in the "20-20" club
as the junior attackman
tallied 26 goals and was
credited with 23 assists.
Lowery and sopho
more defenseman Brian
Abbott were first-team
all-conference selections.
A freshman started
in goal for the Bullets in
all 16 games this season.
Andrew Barter made 191
saves and allowed only
108 goals to finish with a
.639 save percentage.
The 191 saves is the
sixth-highest single
season total in school

TKE_'s troubles
trivial ?
House closed, but not for long

by Rebecca Babbit
The Tau Kappa Epsilon house, which
planned to undergo a $500,000 renovation
this year, sustained $30,000 in damage when
an unknown number of TKE brothers
"kicked in walls and windows," said TKE
president, Danny Smith.
The incident occurred during final
exam week last semester on May 8 and 9.
"There were 10 to 15 people in the house,"
said Smith. "There was really nobody
around."
Legal action is being taken against the
brothers accused of vandalizing the prop
erty. All disciplinary action against the
brothers accused of causing the damage has
been initiated by the TKE Board of Advi
sors, a group of alumni who act as a hous
ing corporation. Neither the college nor
TKE nationals have taken action against any
of the brothers regarding this incident.

TKE's renovations were set to begin
this summer, however, "'because of the
amount of damage, the project has been
pushed back a year," said Smith.
TKE alumni were able to raise
$550,000 to pay for renovations-the most
of any house on campus.

The College was considering loaning
up to $300,000 to TKE as part of a program

to renovate fraternity houses on campus, but
is now reconsidering the offer.
"We are not prepared to give them
money, until we are convinced they are
moving in the right direction," said Dennis
Murphy, Dean of Greek Organizations.
Most of the brothers are living off
campus, according to Smith.
"The house is not livable," said Jason
Gareis, President of the Interfraternity coun
cil. "We basically told them, 'you're on
your own'" said Murphy. "This is an un
usual situation. We're not in the position to
house 25 more students."
TKE is "running the same," said
Smith. "We are not in trouble."
"This adds pressure from sources that
had negative ideas about the greek system,"
said Gareis. "It's fuel for the fire."

"We're going to have to work hard to
get more positive publicity," said Gareis.
The Psi chapter of TKE was founded
at Gettysburg in 1926 and currently has 33
active brothers.

Student Senate highlights: 9/1/97

byDanLarkin
News Editor The Gettysburg College
Student Senate held its first meet
ing of the 1997-1998 academic
year Monday evening.
President Abbey Rodgers
opened the meeting by welcom
ing back the returning senators.
Rodgers stated that Senate's main
goal for the year would be "alter
native social programming," and
the majority of senate business
should focus on this goal. She
also stated a desire to reduce the
time of senate meetings, with an
emphasis placed on "quality, not
quantity."
It was announced that elec
tions for first year senators and

class officers will be held on
Wednesday Sept. 10 and Thursday
11. All first-year students who are
interested are encouraged to attend
information sessions held in the sen
ate offices.
The formation of a commit
tee was announced to submit a pro
posal to the College for the creation
of a dance club in currently vacant
warehouse space beneath the Ma
jestic complex. Ideas for this club
include a disco and a bar for stu
dents over 21. Ideas for this project
were said to be "very vague right
now." Senate treasurer _.Sara
Zalewski announced that Senate's
budget currently stands at around $

16,000. According to Zalewski, the
budget was cut about 5% from last
year. Due to the budget cut and the
cost of outstanding bills, all senate
sponsored student organizations
were cut 20% of their previous bud
gets. She said that money was re
moved from Senate's budget to
help fund the _organisations. She
urged organizations to spend their
money wisely, and to co-sponsor
events with other organizations.
She also announced that Sen
ate will begin implementing fines
this year for poor attendance and
failure to meet other responsibili
ties. All senators, officers, and or
ganizations will be subject to these
fines.

College Store committee makes decision

byDanLarkin
News Editor

A committee formed to re
view and redefine the mission of
the Gettysburg College Store has
reached a conclusion concerning
the direction of the bookstore. The
store has begun to implement these
changes this semester.

The College Store Re
view Advisory Committee com
prised of faculty, administrators,
staff, and a student was appointed
in the fall of 1996 by Vice Presi
dent Jennie Mingoielli to set a vi
sion for the College Store and to
identify key initiatives and direc
tions for (he future.

Much speculation and
rumor concerning the College's
plans for the store created contro
versy on campus last semester.
Concerns were raised about the
possible outsourcing of the store
to a large corporation, such as
Barnes and Noble, and the poten
tial budget and personnel problems

that would bring with it.
As part of the review pro
cess, the committee solicited sug
gestions from members of all sec
tors of the community; visited
bookstores on other college cam
puses; interviewed and heard pre
sentations from the Gettysburg
College Store staff; and met with
an architect to review design op
tions. The committee resolu
tion states that "two major themes
emerged from our review of the
current situation: first we recom
mend that the College improve the
selection and offering of trade
books in the College Store and sec
ond, we recommend that the Col
lege Store be oriented more toward
supporting an intellectual atmo
sphere on campus."
With regard to the
Store's location, the resolution
states: "The issue of location of the
store/bookstore is absolutely criti
cal to the success of the store. We
believe the store must be in a high
traffic location."

It continues to state that
"We lack consensus within the
Committee on whether to separate
the college store physically from
a new bookstore, or whether the
bookstore can encompass the Col
lege Store and share a location."
The Committee recom
mended two phases to resolve the
location issue: "Phase 1 — an ex
pansion in or around the present

We need
writers
x6449

phtoto by Mark Astrom

location, with emphasis on short
term, low cost options; Phase 2 -
a new space renovated, built or
acquired to design specifications."
The Committee also rec
ommended to move immediately
into Phase 1, and "hold off on any
major expenditures until we have
two to three years of experience to
evaluate the success of Phase 1."
In conclusion, the Advisory
Committee stated: "The store must
house a stronger selection of trade
books and that the store must play
a more significant role in foster
ing an intellectual climate on cam
pus. The store can become far
more fully engaged in promoting
a lively conversation about books
among students and faculty. The
store can serve as a natural venue
for intellectual book-centered pro
gramming and casual interaction.

We seek a bookstore with a
bookstore ambiance. We aim for
a program which not only sells
books, but which celebrates the en
joyment of books as both a soli
tary and communal activity. By
implementing the recommenda
tions proposed above, we believe
the College Store can better
achieve this very important aspect
of its mission."

Paparazzi to face probe for
role in Princess' death
PARIS
A French Judge tuesday de
clared seven paparazzi to be sus
pects in the death of Princess Diana
early Sunday morning in a car
crash. The Princess' armored
Mercedes-Benz sedan crashed af
ter a high speed chase by celebrity
hunting photographers on motor
cycles through a tunnel.
Newly disclosed informa
tion, however, has pointed at a com
bination of deadly factors leading
to the Princess' death.
A police analysis found
that chauffeur Henr i Paul's blood
alcohol level may have been almost
four times the legal limit at the time
nf the crash.

The photographers had
been in custody since being ar
rested at the crash scene Sunday
morning. Judge Herve Stephan
placed them under formal investi
gation for "involuntary homicide,"
the French equivalent of man
slaughter. They will not necessar
ily be formally charged with any
cr ime. The paparazzi will also be
investigated for failing to aid people
in danger, under French "good sa
maritan" law. If they are charged
and found guilty, the paparzzi face
potential punishment of up to five
years in jail and $100,000 in fines.
Huge crowds engulfed St.
James Palace earlier this week
where Diana' s body lay in state
until Saturday's funeral.
The White House an
nounced that First Lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton will attend the fu
neral on behalf of the United States.

Giant Panda gives birth to
twins Beijing One of China's endangered
pandas has given birth to health

The twins were born over
the weekend at the Giant Panda
Protection and Research Center in
the Woolong Reserve in the South
western Sichuan province and
weighed 5.25 ounces and 4.55
ounces the official Xinhua news
agency said.
Mother and cubs were in
excellent condition, it said.
Pandas rarely become
pregnant in artificial environments,
with morethan 90 percent of male

Senate investigates VP's
role in temple fund-raiser

As White House officials
again proclaimed Vice President Al
Gore's innocence, Senate investiga
tors Tuesday prepared to lay out a
strong case that Mr. Gore knew all
along that an election-year event he
attended at a Buddhist temple in
California was a fund-raiser.
Senate sources said in
vestigators want to find a missing
video-tape of the April 1996 lun
cheon at the Hsi Lai Temple out
side Los Angeles. They plan to re
trieve the video form the Temple's
headquarters in Taiwan.
In effort to clear the Vice
President of any wrong-doing,
White House officials stated that he
was in the dark about the session,
which raised more than $166,000
for the Democratic Party.
Of the event, Mr. gore said
"It was a mistake. BUt I was told it
was not a fund-raiser, and that's a
fact." Postal worker attacks wife,

A postal worker opened fire yesterday in a crowded post office,

women enter the post office about 1 p.m., said a police spokesman.
Each victim was shot once, and then the gunman walked away
casually, police and witnesses said.
"Exited the post office, went to a tree, looked up in the air and
shot himself in the face," the spokesman said.
Police identified the gunman as Jesus Antonio Tamayo, 65. A

Catholic school teachers begin year on picket lines
Lay teachers at the 22 Catholic high schools in the Archdiocese

New policies reduce diversity

College Press Service
Laura Rothstein, a Univer
sity of Houston law professor,
says she's gotten a taste of what
a classroom is like with fewer
minority students.
Speaking to a civil rights
advisory group in Austin,
Rothstein recounted how a recent
class discussions on housing dis
crimination was far less heated
than in past years, when more
minority students were in the
class. This year, only two black
students are enrolled in her pov
erty laws class.
"All of the students in my
class were harmed because of
that loss. Affirmative action
doesn't just benefit minorities, it
benefits all students."

plications from Hispanic students
fell 22 percent.
Applications from white stu
dents dropped too, by 14 percent, bul
overall more white and Asian stu
dents received offers of admissions
this year than last. That reverses a
trend toward increased college en
rollment of minority students over
the last decade, recently outlined in
report by the College Board.
In Texas, university officials
say one reason for the decline is a
new essay requirement that deters
less ambitious applicants. But
some blame "the Hopwood effect,"
a reference to the federal court case
that blocked most college sin Texas,
Louisiana and Mississippi from us
ing racial preferences in undergradu
ate admissions and scholarships.
In 1992, Cheryl Hopwood and
three other white students sued UT's
law school, saying they had been
denied admission so that less quali
fied minority students could be ad
mitted. A federal appeals court
agreed that the UT's policies were
discriminatory.
The Texas system adopted
a "race-neutral" policy and now
gives more consideration to an
applicant's experience overcoming
adversity or other special circum
stances. Still, fewer minorities have
been accepted.
Experts predict that many
minority students will accept offers
form private universities that still
offer race-based scholarships.

Even as national surveys
show solid gains in college en
rollment for minority students,
several campuses say the end re
sult of bitter affirmative action
battles is a sharp decrease in mi
nority applicants.
Following decisions to dis
mantle their race-preferential
programs, public universities in
Texas and California report that
applications form black and His
panic students for next year's
freshman class have plummeted.

The Greek Word

by Erin Patterson and Kevin
Howard Public Relations Chairs - Panhel
and IFC This is the introductory
article of a column that will in
form the public of any and all
Greek events. Since this is the
first one we don't have much in
formation to dish out, but we'll
give you what we've got.
Good news First-Year stu
dents ! At the IFC (InterFraternity
Council) meeting of September
1, 1997, the amendment to pre
vent First-year Students into any
registered social events at frater
nity houses prior to Reading

Days was repealed, so hrst-year stu
dents are now permitted to attend the
parties, assuming they are invited, of
course. Just some guidelines for you
to try to adhere to : the houses on
campus are the residences of many
students, and those students who live
in those houses take a lot of pride in
them, and would sincerly appreci
ate it, if you too would respect their
house as much as they do. The last
thing a brother wants to see in his
house is students vandalizing his
house in any way. Always remeber
that no matter how many people you
know, you are still a guest in another
person's house, and that person al
ways reserves the right to ask you to

leave. Hopefully this will not be a
problem, but we wanted to clarify
it just in case.
In other news, this week
end SAC put on another great show
with the Gibb Droll Band, and yes
you weren't mistaken, there were
two Greek organizations out there
setting up the stage Friday after
noon and taking it down later Fri
day evening. The brothers at Al
pha Tau Omega volunteered their
time to help with the logistics of
the concert by setting up the stage
and the band's equipment. Later
that evening, the brothers of Alpha
Chi Rho also volunteered their
time to "load out" the band's

equpiment and take down the
stage. We want to take this time
to congratulate those two organi
zations on a job well done.
On the sorority scene,
just a reminder that the meeting
time for Panhel has been changed
to 6:15 on Monday evening at
CUB 260. Make a note of this,
and remember anyone is welcome
and encouranged to attend. An
other minor change in meeting
time for IFC has also been made.
The meeting will now take place
at 8:30 and will still rotate from
house to house.
We want to take this time
now to ask all Greek organiza¬

tions who want to have something
mentioned in our column to con
tact us:

The Student Activities Coun
cil has announced the singer who
will at the Fall Concert. On Satur
day, November 1, singer Fiona
Apple will be playing in the CUB
Ballroom. Tickets will be $ 18 with
Gettysburg College ID, or $21 to
the general public in the lobby of
the CUB (among other places), and
go on sale in mid-October
This 19-ycar old singer has
lelcascd only one album so far, but
that album, Tidal, has already gone
gold, having sold ovci 500,000
copies all over the woi Id Apple is
known ioi her songs "Criminal"
and "Shadowboxci," both ol which
have videos currently playing on
MTV Apple will peiionn on the
MTV Video Music Awards tonight
at 8pm, and she is up Ioi the
_avvaid ol Best New Artist

Apple's album consists
mostly ol the aitisl accompanying
herself on the piano, with peicus
sion or guitar on a few tracks Her
songs deal mainly with suffering
and pain, which is undeistandablc,
since Apple was laped at the age
of 12. "I've lived a lot in my little
lilc," she says, "but I'm not saying
that I know something about rela
tionships or life. I just say what I
feel and what I know."
Apple grew up in Manhattan,
the child of a former dancer and
singer and an actor. Her parents
never married. Apple was so de
pressed that her mother sent her to
a psychiatrist as a child, and she
developed an interest in writing,
from which grew a fascination with
songwriting She wrote to provide
an emotional outlet to satisfy the
desire to express herself. "I didn't
think of it as a fun thing to do," she
commented. "I thought it was the
only thing I could do."

Apple has very deep feelings
about her music, and music in gen
eral. "The way I feel about music
-any song, any style—is that there
is no right and wrong, only true and

SAC announces concert planned for November

false. If the music and lyrics
are conceived out of honesty
and if the production of the
song goes along with its origi
nal message, then what has
been expressed is art, regardless
of what anyone's opinion is of
it. So things arc a lot simpler if
you just tell the truth."
Apple didn't envision

herself as a performer when she
was younger. "It wasn't that I
didn't think I had a nice voice, but
I consider myself more of a
writer. I've played piano since I
was about eight, and always
wrote songs—I sang them be
cause it wouldn't make sense for
anyone else to."
And her throaty, smoky

voice is perfect for her songs. "People
expect me to be an old black woman
when they hear my music," Apple
commented. She was influenced by
blues singer Billic Holliday, which
may help explain this.
Many students were thrilled
when they heard that Apple would be
coming to Gettysburg. "lam thrilled!"
exclaimed sophomore Jody Robertson.
When asked to describe Apple's mu¬

sic, Robertson replied, "She re
minds me of Tori Amos, though
their singing is not similar. I...just
like it."
Sophomore Juniper Day
agrees with Robertson and ex
picssed excitement about the im
minent concert. "She has a unique
sound," Day .said of Apple. Both
sophomore just got to know
Apple's music this summer.
Apple played with Lilith
Fan, the all-female lour conceived
by Sarah McLachlan. Other art
ists who performed with the Fan
include Mary Chapin Carpenter,
Tiacy Chapman, Sheiyl Crow,
Susanna Hoffs (of the Bangles), the
Indigo _Guls, Jewel, Lisa Locb,
Joan Osbouinc, and Su/anne Vega
Wilting songs and perfoim
mg "is something 1 think I've al
ways wanted to do," said Apple,
"but didn't say aloud--I wouldn't
admit it to myself, because admit
ting it meant making myscll vul
nciable to the possibility that it
might not happen, and that thought
was unbearable."

It wasn't until Apple felt that
making a move would be the nghl
thing to do that she moved to Los
Angeles to write That's when "I
decided the doois were open foi
me. It's not so much that this is
my destiny, but I made it my des
tiny—it's impossible to imagine life
not doing what you want to do."
Tidal was released in July
of 1996, and was produced by An
drew Slater, the manager of the
Wallflowers. Apple's first single,
"Shadowboxer," went Top Ten, and
she was then likened to "the high
priestess of soul" Nina Simonc,
and her song-writing was com
pared to that of Carol King.
Clearly this teenager will go far.

many FionaApple websites and the

Robertson.



Jane pleases without
being obnoxious

byJonFr oehlich
Staff Writer
"G.I. Jane", starring Demi
Moore ("A Few Good Men,"
"Ghost") as Lt. O'Neil, and di
rected by Ridley Scott, is a movie
that attempts to comment on how
men and women arc constantly
being treated differently, both in
the US military and in society at
large. This movie not only tries to
tackle the above gender issues, but
also offers a fairly entertaining
story. After a shady political deal
between a female Senator and the
newly elected Secretary of the
Navy goes down, Lt. O'Neil be
comes a test subject in an experi
ment regarding the complete and
total integration of women into the
US Navy. But this proposal, along
with Lt. O'Neil's opportunity, are
simply for political show.
As part of this experiment,
O'Neil becomes the first woman

ever to be admitted to what is most
often considered the toughest mili
tary division in the world - the
Navy SEALS.
From this point on, "G.I.
Jane" takes on two distinct mis
sions. One is to tell the story of
Lt. O'Neil and attempt to give au
diences an accurate picture of
the Navy SEALS. The other, done
on a more subconscious level, is
to shed some light on attitudes to
wards gender in politics and the
military. "G.I. Jane's" message
about equality is an unavoidable
one simply because of the plot.
The more entertaining of
"G.I. Jane's" two missions, and
most likely the one that will draw

people to the theater, is the first
one. Because O'Neil is the only
woman in her class, she is natu
rally treated as the "new kid" and
scorned by many of her male crew
members. In the SEALS, O'Neil
finds only unequal treatment. Not
only is O'Neil frustrated by her
crew trying to make things more
difficult, she is also upset at how
the Navy tries to make things
easier on her relative to the men.
With these two forces work
ing against her, O'Neil seems
blocked at every turn by a defense
mechanism on the part of the Navy
to avoid embarrassment should
their plan back-fire. It doesn't take
long for her to realize that no one

expects, or wants, her to succeed.
But instead of giving up as every
one expects, O'Neil's determina
tion is immeasurably increased.
This turning point can be symbol
ized by what is perhaps the most
well known scene in which O'Neil
ceremonially shaves her head like
the rest of her crew.
From then on, "G.I. Jane"
progresses into what audiences
might predict - a proud story of a
woman finding the inner strength
and determination to overcome
both political and social obstacles
to infiltrate what was traditionally
a man's world. Where she once
found only closed minds and harsh
attitudes, she eventually uncovers
the kind of camaraderie that we all

crave. Though it may be difficult
for audiences to shake the cliche
"This is not a drill!," perhaps the
actual combat that the director
throws in at the end of this movie
is necessary to prove something.
In this movie, which involves a
woman who is constantly having
to prove herself, some actual per
formance in combat may be re
quired to put many of the issues
approached to rest.
"G.I. Jane" fits right in with
many of director Scott's other
films. Having directed films such
as "Alien" (starring Sigourney
Weaver) and "Thelma and Louise"
(starring Geena Davis and Susan
Sarandon), Scott seems partial to
using strong, and sometimes quite

masculine, heroines in leading
roles. Though "G.I. Jane" may not
have the heart stopping action of
"Alien" or the emotional suspense
of "Thelma and Louise," it does
avoid negative feminist stereo
types, and harbors a story line that,
while fairly predictable, will most
likely be satisfying to audiences.
With especially good perfor
mances by Morris Chestnut
("Boyz N the Hood," "The Last
Boy Scout") as a fellow crew
member and Viggo Mortenson
("Crimson Tide," "Witness") as the
ominous Master Chief in charge of
the recruits, "G.I. Jane" is a decent
movie that, while it may not make
you want to join the SEALS, will
make you respect all those who
have stood up against injustice to
defend their beliefs.

The Curtain Call
Exciting year planned for theater

The O&N, as many in the
theater like to call it, is formally
known as the Owl and Nightingale
Players. This is a student group
that, in conjunction with the the
ater department, is committed to
enhancing live art on campus.
The O&N performs fall,
winter, and spring productions
each year. The shows frequently
represent various styles and peri
ods. Shows have included dramas
such as Tennessee Williams' Cat
on a Hot Tin Roof (4/97), post
restoration comedies like Richard
Brinsley Sheridan's The Rivals (2/
97), classical Shakespeare such as
Macbeth (2/96), modern comedies
like Lee Blessing's Fortinbras (4/
96), musicals of the same ilk as
Kander and Ebb's Chicago (2/93)
and many others.

department

In addition, the O&N pro
vides opportunities for students to
be involved in student-directed
"lunchtimes" (fifteen minutes
scenes usually performed over the
lunch hour) and one-act plays.
The lunchtimes are directed
by the students in the Advanced
Directing class: Phil Anderson,
Glen Beck, Alec Beekmans,
Samantha Gregg, Brian Hershfeld,
Tim Johnsen, Jeremy Katz,
Duncan Niederer, Dan Novall,
Erica Strang, and Alexa Warren.
The lunchtimes beginning

on September 15 include such
scenes as, "The Jest of Hahalaba,"
"Street Scene," "Here We Are,"
"No Problem," "Graceland," "Me
Ow," "The Hat," and "Business
man." A student executive board
encourages and fosters involve
ment to promote the theater on
campus. This year's board is al
ready in the process of enacting
several changes that will give stu
dents who are interested in theater
more opportunities to become in
volved. Such changes include the
revival of the Theater Honor Soci
ety.

The student board lor this
year is Glen Beck (president), Tim
Johnsen, Alec Beekmans,
Samantha Gregg, and Megan
Manthey.
In theater news, the fall show

Roosters, by Milcha Sanchez
Scott, has been cast. The cast in
cludes Sam Gregg (Juana), Jenni
fer MacMurtie (Angela), Megan
Manthey (Chala), Dave Schoffner
(Hector), Paul Lapato (Adan), Rob
Thompson (Gallo), Jeremy Katz
(Abuclo), Alec Beekmans
(Zapata),- and Mary Cordero,
Michael Ferrer, Colleen Hubbard,
Jeffrey Jones, and James Kohn as
Shadows.
The production will be di
rected by Dr. George Muschamp
and assistant director Glen Beck.
The set designer is Jerry Hanson,
stage manager is Duncan Niederer,
and student technical director is
Jody Robertson. Dr. Muschamp
hopes to get the community in
volved with the production, so if
you have an interest in being in
volved with the production, please
don't hesitate to contact Dr.
Muschamp at the theater.

For the first time in recent
years, the O&N announces the full

year's season. Roosters is the fall
show, set to open Family Weekend
In the winter, the players will per
form Cotton Patch Gospel, a blue
grass musical similar toGodspell.
Finally, in the spring, the produc
tion will be Landford Wilson's Hot
L Baltimore.
The theater department is
also looking for anyone who is in
terested and able to play blue-grass
music (on drums, guitar, banjo,
etc.). Please contact Glen Beck or
Professor Emile Schmidt if inter
ested. This year promises to be a
particularly good year for theater,
so keep your eye on Brua Hall.
The first performances of the year
will be the lunchtimes, which open
on September 15. Look for more
information in future issues of the
Gettysburgian.

This column will run every
other week, alternating with a col
umn from GECO.

The overnight at Camp Tuckahoe was a wonderful
experience. I enjoyed being able to talk openly with my
classmates as well as upperclassmen. The night allowed me
to see another aspect of the Gettysburg community. Thanks
for a great trip and the opportunity to meet new friends.

Students find ways to add spice and life to their rooms

Looking for ideas to liven up your room? Bored with your

byMelodieFoster
StaffWriter Do you ever walk down the
hall of your dorm, look at the other
rooms, and think "Gosh, why can't
my room look like that?" Well, fret
no more. You too can have a room
that will attract visitors, entertain
friends, and be comfortable to sit
around and do nothing in...oops..I
mean to study in.
What makes a room great?
Well, there are many factors: fur
niture, posters, rugs, and accesso
ries such as a TV, stereo, plants,
pictures, curtains, and art work.
How these things are used depends
entirely on the person, but a few
generalizations can be made. For
example, when you walk into a
room, you can immediately tell if
the occupants are male, female,
first-year, or upperclassmen.
There are huge differences
between girls' rooms and guys'

rooms. Girls rooms are cute,
comfy, homey. They are more
likely to put up curtains, match,
and hang aesthetically pleasing
posters; says one junior, "I'm not
afraid to hang up pictures of cute
animals."
Girls' beds have lots of pil
lows-the body pillow is popular
and stuffed animals. Their post
ers differ greatly from many in
guys' rooms. Posters that girls have
hanging often include sunsets,
little kids, animals, people kissing,
collages of photographs of friends.
In a guy's room, especially
if he has an apartment, one finds a
common theme: beer. Posters of
beer bottles, of beer cans, and
scantily clad women holding beer
are all over the walls. Lighted beer
signs, pyramids of cans, and win
dow displays of empty alcohol
bottles also add to the overall ef
fect.

Perhaps the most important
two items to have in a room are a
rug and a couch. Not only does a
rug protect bare feet from the cold
tile in the middle of winter, but a
rug can make a room look bigger
and more inviting.
A couch is a very good thing
if you have the space. Sophomore
Andrew Lee purchased a five-sec
tion white couch this summer from
a furniture barn for $ 139 because
"it was necessary for the sanctity
of the room." The mammoth
couch covers an entire corner, and
this makes Lee happy: "Now I
have my refrigerator, my TV, and
my couch all in one place; I'm
never going to move again."
A TV, though a big distrac
tion and excuse to procrastinate
("But Paity of Five is on—I'll start
my paper at ten, really"), brings a
little of the outside world into a
room. It can also be the focal point

stuff? Sick of your posters ? Look her el

of your room.
Junior Jay Henniger ar
ranged his room in Patrick last year
around his entertainment
centerwhich consisted of a big TV,
stereo, and big speakers. His room
was the home of hall football par
ties and viewings of movies such
as Independence Day that need a
big screen and big speakers with
lots of bass to do them justice.
The best things to have in a
room are interesting conversation
pieces that will draw people in
from the hallway, such a a big
couch, a crazy poster, a life size
cardboard cutout of Elvis (just ask
Marybeth Misluk), an odd chair,
or strange pieces of art.
Lisa Wingenroth, a sopho
more, brought with her this year a
plaster of Paris sculpture of a
dancer from a play put on in her
hometown. She commented laugh
ingly "it's a dancer; I couldn't let

them throw it out." The residents
of her floor hope to make the statue
a hall mascot, and plan to deco
rate him for holidays.
Where can you get all this
cool stuff? The Poster and Plant
sale sponsored by the College is a
good place to start. This year's sale
will be held next week. Yard sales,
attics, basements, and Wal-Mart
are all good places to find inexpen
sive, and often original decorations
and pieces of furniture. So get
motivated, get imaginative, and get
out there and start looking. There's
lots of great stuff to be found.

Dear Casey...

Dear Casey,
I need advice. I'm con
cerned about my friend. She
won't tell a guy who she's friends
with that she doesn't want to date
him. Meanwhile, she's interested
in a couple of other guys and is
thinking about asking one of
them out without telling Guy #1
that she "just wants to be
friends." I really don't care who
she dates, but I just don't want
her to get hurt. Please help.
A Confused Reader.
Dear Confused Reader,
This problem does not re
volve around whom your friend
likes, but whom she might not like:
herself. Everyone likes attention
and attraction, and of course it is
always an ego pat when someone
thinks you are special. It seems as
if your friend is enjoying this atten
tion too much to give it up. Hon
estly, though, who would want to
give it up?

men to dote on her.
Don't be fierce, but be hon
est and firm. Humans are not toys,
but they can be broken easily.
Dear Casey,
There's this guy I was re
ally good friends with last year
When I got here this semester, I
realized I liked him as moe than
a friend. I am really shy and
could never just tell him how I
feel. What do you think?
A Shy Heart
Dear Shy Heart,
One of the best things about
solid and healthy relationships is
that they re always changing and
taking different directions. And of
ten, good friendships with the op
posite sex have the possibility of be
coming strong "more than friends"
relationships. This will often take
time. It happened to me once, but
it took 12 years, and just happened
naturally.

I admire your concern about
her getting hurt in this situation,
but I personally would be more
concerned about the guy she is
leading on. People and emotions
should not be manipulated as ex
periments or as ego pats, and I
think you and your friend should
have a heart to heart about a few
issues—mainly respect. Respect for
this young man who has serious
feelings for her, and respect for
human emotions in general. But,
more than both of these, she should
have some respect for herself, and
not need to have an entourage of

I understand that you may
have qualms about losing him as a
friend by being direct, so take your
time, enjoy your friendship and let
things evolve naturally. All things
happen in due course. Who knows,
maybe you will find yourselves dis
cussing relationships over a cup of
coffee, and both of you will realize
that you would make a great pair.
But if that never comes to pass, en
joy having a friend of the opposite
sex. They are great for advice. Good
luck. If you have a question for
Casey, please write to Box 434.

Pachyderm's Pulpit

The summer is now over,
students are heading back to
school, family vacations are com
plete, the time to work has re
turned. According to most eco
nomic indicators as well as the
feeling in country there is plenty
of work out there. Unemployment
is down, the stock market, while
recently taking a slight plunge is
soaring, inflation and interest rates
are virtually non-existent. Not
only is the economy doing well,
but the budget is being balanced,
people are fleeing from the wel
fare rolls, and crime is falling, par
ticularly in our major cities. At the
most recent G-8 Summit of indus¬

trialized nations held in Denver,
Colorado President Clinton stood
atop his pedestal to explain how
his American model is so success
ful. The world must hope that the
President's fellow summiters do
not take his advice. Iftheydothen
they will have higher taxes, a bud
get in deficit, and a national pro
gram of socialized medicine. A
key reason that the United States
is doing so well is that Bill
Clinton's agenda was rejected.
Rejected by the Congress over
health-care and rejected by the
American people in 1994 when the
elected the first Republican Con
gress in 50 years.

Following that historic
rejection the President wisely
rolled over to the popular Repub
lican agenda of lower taxes, a bal-

by John Dunlap
anced budget, and welfare reform.
Rather than being the national
leader he rolled over and became
a "Me-too" President. The Repub
lican agenda worked during the
Reagan era, largest peacetime eco
nomic growth in our history, lower
crime, and yes we happened to win
the Cold War when some liberals
wanted us to retreat from the Com
munist threat. The Republican
Congress passed welfare reform
and after vetoing it twice, the
President finally signed it with the
1996 election approaching, when
the Republican Congress and the
Republican Presidential ticket of
Bob Dole and Jack Kemp called
for tax cuts, there was Bill Clinton
saying me-too. This summer af
ter fighting them for months de
spite taking credit for what the
Congress was doing, President
Clinton signed the first balanced
budget in a generation.

The most interesting as
pect of the balanced budget bill
was the Medicare provision. The
same medicare plan that Bob Dole
supported and Bill Clinton trashed.
Along with organized labor and
foreign campaigning cash, Bill
Clinton, said over and over that
Dole-Gingrich are cutting Medi
care. Well, Mr. President, Bob
Dole and Newt Gingrich were
right and you admitted that by
agreeing to their demands. It is a
shame that day and day out the
media is not pointing out the

President's hypocrisy, that only
shows their left-wing bias.
If President Clinton re
ally wants to know what makes our
nation so successful then he had
better sit down with Governor John
Engler ofMichigan who cut taxes
and balanced the budget, which
brought his state back from eco
nomic ruin. Or Governor Tommy
Thompson of Wisconsin who re
formed welfare in his state and
found that people do not starve, the
find work. He should also sit down
with Mayor Guilianni of New York
who showed leadership, took on
criminals and won. They are all
Republicans and they are carrying
out the Reagan agenda.
Now even devout liberals
are caving, while the rest of the
nation is growing, Maryland for
instance, with its liberal leadership
is staying behind.

President Clinton has be
come the Mikhail Gorbachev of
America. Like Gorbachev, the
President is watching his ideology,
liberalism, die. Die at the polls, in
the states, and in Congress. No one
can run on a liberal platform in
mainstream America. Mr. Clinton
had to move to the center and he
still only received 49% of the vote.
Just as Gorbachev made conces
sions to save Communism, our
making concessions to save big
government, but election by elec
tion the President is failing. That
is the American miracle.

Consider this . . .

A lot of attention has been
paid to this little paper over the past
two semesters. And with good rea-*
son. On the eve of our 100th an
niversary, we became the first
newspaper to print the tragic story
of our classmate Brian Peterson.
Our historic anniversary was
marked by parties and receptions.
We traveled up and down the East
Coast attending conferences where
we were recognized nationally.
We are currently contenders in the
"pulitzer prize of student journal
ism" --the Pacemaker Award.
Most importantly, the con
tent and coverage of the
Gettysburgian changed. Our staff
increased in size and we were able
to cover more campus events and
do so in a more complete fashion.
The design and layout be
came more reader-friendly and
modern.

But all these changes came
with growing pains.

We quickly outgrew the
computer system we had been us
ing for many years and after many
tribulations, we were able to pur
chase over $15,000 of the latest
newspaper computer technology.
New machines should make
everything new and improved,
right? Not so at the Gettysburgian.
Through a series of circumstance
beyond our control, including but
certainly not limited to the UPS/
Teamsters strike, we have been

unable to get everything up and
running as we had originally
hoped.
This sometimes disastrous
situation has led to obvious flaws
in recent issues that are far below
our normal standards.
We at the Gettysburgian sin
cerely apologize for the lax report
ing and poor design of our beloved
newspaper.
Please bear with us as we
work out the many problems that
have been plaguing our transition.
We will continue to bring
you the latest news, the most in
triguing commentary, the best Bul
lets sports coverage, and the best
coverage of campus entertainment
and features.
We will supplement our
usual coverage with a technology
section, themed features, and by
making our publication available
on our web site.

We have changed our adver
tising policy to increase revenue

ana _oe using -or--an
photography, layout, and informa
tion gathering techniques to bring
you increasing coverage of the
campus community.
In the coming weeks you
will no doubt notice substantial
improvements in the newspaper,
including a few surprises.
We look forward to a pro
ductive year filled with many more
adventures.
Thank you for your continu
ing support and patience.

Conflict and Consensus

Dear Editor:
on August 26, police found a dozen students passed out in a fraternity on the LSU campus. One, 20
year old Benjamin Wyyne, was already dead as the result of acute alcohol poisoning, three other students
were hospitalized.
Unfortunately, the behavior which led to Benjamin Wynne's death is far too common on our own
campus. Our March 1997 CORE Survey revealed that 67% of our students "binge drank" in the two weeks
before the survey. There is no reason, other than luck, which accounts for our not having experienced an on
campus alcohol related death in recent years, colleges around us (F&M, Dickinson, York) have not been as
fortunate.
Most of us know what alcohol does at high levels in our bloodstream. But it's not just the alcohol that
killed Benjamin Wynne. To protect ourselves, we often assume that bad things happen only to "bad" people.
But the fact is that tragedy can occur to any of us, "good" or "bad". Other factors in Benjamin's death were
the campus drinking culture, the way group dynamics influence individual choices and behavior, and inaccu
rate assumptions we make about "normal" college drinking.
I often hear students say that Gettysburg is a "safe" place to drink because drinking doesn't usually
involve driving. Bloomsburg University has lost seven students to alcohol-related deaths in the past five
years... none of these deaths involved cars. Gettysburg is not safer than Bloomsburg, F&M, Dickinson or
LSU. Let's all keep in mind that bad things do happen to good people and that we want to rely on more than
just luck to get us all through the year safely.

Sincerely,
Hariet Marritz

Women s Lax
makes EC AC bid

from Gettysburg Sports Release
A junior-dominated scoring
punch, aggressive defenders and
a stingy goalie added up to a suc
cessful 1997 campaign for the
Gettysburg College women's la
crosse team.
Head Coach Carol Daly's
squad concluded the season with
a 12-5 record. The Bullets fin
ished second behind Johns
Hopkins in the Centennial Con
ference and advanced to the East
ern Colleges Athletic Conference
(ECAC) Mid-Atlantic Champion
ships. A trio of juniors—Kim
Fritz, Leslie Marotz, and Chrissy
Nordhoff—accounted for more
than half of the Bullets' 193 goals
in 1997.

Fritz was the team leader in
both goals (47) and assists (13).
Marotz was a close runner-up in
the scoring department with 41
goals and nine assists. Nordhoff
furnished the Bullets with 32
goals and 11 assists.
With one season of eligibil
ity remaining, Marotz ranks
fourth in school history in career
goals with 125. Fritz and Marotz
are two of only six players in
school history to surpass 100
goals during their careers.
Another junior, Kris
Sullivan, was the Bullets' fourth
leading scorer in 1997. She had
21 goals and five assists to go
along with her team-leading 85
ground balls.
The only three seniors on

the Bullets' 1997 roster were key
contributors to the program's suc
cess. Goalie Carolyn Holmes
made 211 saves and allowed only
134 goals while playing every
minute of every game. She departs
Gettysburg as the career leader in
saves with 728.
Fritz and Marotz made the
all-region squad's first team at at
tack, while Sullivan was placed on
the first team's defensive unit.
Holmes was Gettysburg's fourth
all-region player.
Kate Mason was a solid per
former at both ends of the field and
was in the Bullets' starting lineup
37 times during her career.
Holmes and Mason were in
vited to play in the third annual
North/South All-Star women's la
crosse game on June 7 in Balti
more. Thirty-six of the sport's top
seniors, representing 30 different
Division III schools, were selected
to participate in the contest.

Four players were placed on
the 1997 Brine/Intercollegiate
Women's Lacrosse Coaches Asso
ciation Division III All-Central
Region team.
Fritz and Marotz made the
all-region squad's first team attack,
while Sullivan was placed on the
first team's defensive unit. Holmes
was the fourth all-region player.
Randi Ball had the best year
of her career as a senior, scoring
10 times and dishing out nine as
sists. Three freshmen—Kelli
Brennan, Sharon Coghan, and
BethFallon—started all 17 games

Football is Life...
bySteveJenkins
Sports Editor
As the aromas of pork rinds,
charcoal grilled sides of beef, and
hot wings fill the air, America
knows that is is once again time
for another season of NFL and
College football. This Sund
marks the beginning of twenty
solid weeks of cheers, jeers and
testosterone levels that go through
the roof_.
Hey, what other sport can
you purchase tickets to see fat,
middle-aged, tattoo emblazoned,
and blatantly drunk fans root thier
team on to victory? (Okay, besides
WWF Monday night raw). Yes,
now that football is here all Ameri
cans will rejoice with remotes and
popcorn in hand as "The Pack,"
"The Birds," and "Americas
Team," all make their runs at a
Super Bowl Title. Is,

As a consummate fan of
football, I myself have constructed
a beginners approach to watching
and understanding the game.
Football is a game of execu
tion, speed, mental toughness, and
heart. Okay, I know what you are
thinking: "How smart do you have
to be? It is just a bunch of guys
smashing heads together. When
one team smashes more heads than
the other they win the game. How
hard can it be?"
Ah, there is much more be
hind the game than smashing and
punching. You sec each time the
big guys line up to block for the
smaller, faster guys, the coaches on
one team are trying to trick the
coaches on the other team. What
they do is called a "play."
Evcrytime the offense runs a play,
all the guys with one color shirt
have a specific assignment to block
the guys in the other colored shirts.
One player messes up, and the play
goes right down the tubes.

You see, the players who
have the ball arc trying to get past
the players without the ball in or
der to accumulate points. When
you see guys dancing, jumping
into the stands, and back-flipping
in Iront of the cameras, this usu-

Nothing else Matters
ally means the team with the ball
has gotten to the endline and has
augmented their scoie.
Aftei about thirty minutes,
the well conditioned athletes need
a break, so they head back to the
locker room for a rest. During this
intermission, the coaches are
calmly explaining to their players
why the opposing team is pound
ing them into oblivion, or
conversly, how to keep pounding
the opposing team.
If you arc watching at home,
you usually do not see this part of
the game. What you usually see
at halftime is four or five balding,
ex-NFL players trying to re-live
their usually ill-fated careers by
showing and analyzing highlights
from games shown all around the
country. All in all, watching these
guys is pretty fun, but the second
half is the part of the game that any
fan lives for.

When the second half be
gins, both teams have made the
appropriate changes and are ready
for another half of the elegant bal
let of dives, counters, receptions,
sacks, and pass-rushing. The fi
nal quarters tick away as every fan
sits on the edge of his or her seat,
waiting patiently for their team to
make its move.
If you are unfamiliar with
the game, do not be startled by the
empty beer bottles flying by your
head, or nachos protruding from
the mouth of the angry fan next to
you. Just know that this is the pin
nacle of dedication to a team. All

fans strive to reach this plateau, but
many often lall short in their quest.
When you sit down to take
in a game this Saturday or Sunday,
enjoy all that is going on around
you. Whether you are sitting in
you living room, or you actually
go to a game, it is important to un
derstand that football is not easy.
The game is played by hard-work
ing, focused athletes who deserve
some loyal fan support. So as you
stuff your face with pork rinds and
smear barbeque sauce all over your
face, just know that it is all for the
good of the game we know as loot
ball.


Women's Soccer looks to shoot down
Centennial Conference competition

Sports Editor

Lady Bullet sophomores and
freshmen into a tight and cohesive
unit. The sophomore contingent
of Lady Bullets include Lauren
Scott, Maureen McBnen, Lauren
Frankford, Emily Brown, Laura
Zinck, Lauren Morrell, Traci
Bcigen, Stacey Elwood, Patsy
Cors, and Annie Pryor to name just
a few. The real test will be for this
particular group of girls. If these
ladies can work together and help
each other with the experiences
that each of them gained last year,
there is no telling what this squad
can accomplish.
During last year 's women's
soccer campaign, lack of confi
dence, experience, and injuries
riddled a season lilled with many
challenges. This season, with the
experienced team and 7 returning
starters, the team seems poised for

Leadership, heart, and ma
turity are the three qualities that
the Gettysburg women's soccer
team aie relying on this season.
With the loss of only four start
ers and many freshman seeing
time last season, the Lady Bul
lets are experienced and ready to
lead the charge to the Centennial
Conference Title.
Captain Beth O'Boylc
leads a group of women who had
somewhat of a lackluster season
last year, but are ready to pound
out the competition this season.
O'Boyle, along with fellow Se
niors Paula Connard, Robin
Kn/.a_, Knssy Doyle and Juniors
Sabnna Luciano and Shannon
Blair, are going to help mold the

greatness.
After a large turnout for pre
season camp, the roster has been
refined in order to establish a pow
erful lineup for this weekend's up
coming tournament. With games
scheduled for two regionally
ranked opponents, it is necessary
for the Bullets to "bring the noise"
in this weekend's games to find ou
what their squad can really accom
plish. "We have a great chance to
do well," said veteran Lauren
Frankford, "With the players that
we have back, and a talented fresh
man class, the whole team is very
optimistic."
This weekend's tournament
has the Lady Bullets playing host
to regionally ranked Cortland and
Mary Washington. Along with
Moravian, the Bullets will round
out the four team tourney.

Bullets ready to rock the house in 1997

byJoshEyler
Assisstant Sports Editor
As the leaves begin their
change, and Autumn shows signs
that he will soon be "bringin' in da
noise," the competitive football
season is just about to get under
way. Fresh off their annual Orange
and Blue game, the Bullet's grid
iron squad are looking forward to
a scrimmage this Friday night
when they travel to Reading, PA,
to take on Albright College, ranked
second in the nation in Division III.
The Orange and Blue game
was played this past Saturday and
was very successful, even includ¬

ing the fact that several key play
ers were sidelined due to injuries.
Sophomore defensive back Chris
"Sweet Lou" Lunardi said about
the game: "The defense was very
successful, but both sides of the
ball still need to improve. The of
fense showed that it has big play
potential, and hopefully can be
come more consistent. Overall, it
was a lot of fun to finally play in a
game situation and the whole team
is looking forward to scrimmaging
the number two team in the na
tion." This enthusiasm, undoubt
edly shared by all of Lunardi's
teammates, seems to be a trade
mark of the 1997 Bullets.

Predictions for this year's
finish in the Centennial Confer
ence range from sixth in national
publications to third in some local
newspapers.
A veteran packed defense
led by Kevin Gurski, Rob Sena,
Tom Olchon, and Chad Mire in the
backfield_, linebackers Joe
Hodakowski, Jason Osborn, Chris
Felton, and Brian Murphy, and a
stellar line anchored by Justin

"Killer" Domingos and Pete "Wild
Man" Scaffidi, both tackles, and
Scott Grabus and Gene Kraus
playing defensive end should
pound the opposing offenses into
submission this season.
Two questions still remain
ing in Bullet camp concern the of
fense. The first question revolves
around who will lead the offense
at quarterback. Will it be veteran
Chris Fugaro or sophomore
Weston Wells? The second ques
tion concerns who will fill the
empty spot at left guard. Vying

lor this position are Mike Lorge,
Steve Jenkins, and Kevin Cache.
Whoever wins this spot will
be surrounded by an experienced
offensive line that includes Bill
"The Animal" Beining, Bryan
Willard_, Kurt Ritter, and Justin
Ogorek. Junior Mike Holm and
freshman Nate Dahloff will com
plete the line as tight ends. In the
backfield, Paul "Schwarzenegger"
Smith, Matt Helwig, Don
McNellis, and Dan Sheats will all
see significant playing time. Se
nior Wayne Rumsey will return to
handle the kicking duties.

Sophomore Sensation Paul Smith (37) rumbles for yet another touchdown. Paul leads a tough
contingent of starters returning for the Bullets.

Already, in this early part of
the season, one can see that the
Bullets are hitting harder and are
lit with intensity. In the words of
senior linebacker and Bullet cap
tain Joe Hodakowski: "We have a
lot of experience back on both
sides of the ball. Little improve
ments in certain areas will turn
mistakes of last season into wins.
When you look at our schedule,
there is no team that we can't beat.
We had a great off season and ev
eryone is very optimistic." You get
the feeling that the guy is probably
right.

Cordova era comes to a close, but
Bullets stock up with young talent

from Gettysburg Sports Release

another school mark.
Gettysburg's team numbers
attest to the potency of the hitting
attack. The team produced 69
doubles, 29 triples, and 23 home
runs as well as a team slugging
percent of .494, all new school
records.
Freshman first baseman
John Woods had a great impact.
Not only did he bat .404, but he
tied the school record for triples in
a game (2), home runs in a season
(6), and put outs in a season (245).
Another yearling, outfielder
Chris Lunardi joined Woods in hit
ting two triples in a single game.
Senior third baseman Mike Man/.o
tied the school record with his two
home runs in a single game against
Johns Hopkins.

It was a record breaking sea
son for the Gettysburg College
baseball team and, right in the
middle of the action was senior
outfielder Joe Cordova.
Gettysburg completed the
season with a 15-21 record and 10
8 Centennial Conference mark.
However, no less than nine school
records were either tied or broken.
Cordova batted a hefty .433 as he
belted 55 hits in 127 plate appear
ances. The 55 safeties breaks the
old mark of 53 for a single season.
Cordova led the team with 37 runs
scored, 32 runs batted in, 13
doubles, and 13 stolen bases. He
completes his collegiate career
with a .406 batting average, setting

Besides Woods' put outs,
there was one other defensive
record broken. Sophomore second
baseman Mike Wallo accounted
for 81 assists, breaking the old
mark of 69.
Five Gettysburg players
were named to the All-Centennial
Conference team. Cordova was
joined on the first team by senior
designated hitter Joe Trani.
Named to the second team were
Woods and Manzo and receiving
honorable mention was senior
pitcher Chris Volpe. Trani batted
.340 and drove in 20 runs. Volpe
was Gettysburg's leading pitcher
with a 4-3 record, completing four
of the eight games he started. He
had 53 strike-outs and gave up 34
walks.

Senate proposes dance club,
pushes alternative social activities

photo by Mark Aslrom
The Pat McGee Band played to a crowded ballroom last Saturday following the
Shrimpfest

Is the current status of Gettysburg's
social scene providing a safe and fun envi
ronment for students? The recent breaking
up of two large, unregistered parties in Apple
and Ice House seem to indicate that some
thing is lacking in the social oppurtunities
on campus.
In an attempt to deal with this is
sue, last week at the Student Senate's first
meeting of the year, emphasis was placed
on "alternative social programming" as the
organization's main goal for the year. As
past of this objective, a vague description
of a dance club under the Majestic Com
plex was proposed.
Senator Valerie Katzmar was
picked to chair the committee to propose the
project. According to Katzmar, the proposal
is in the "preliminary stages, but is a definite
goal of the Senate." She also emphasized
that other organization were interested in
supporting the project, including SAC, the
Black Student Union, and WZBT. The or
ganization are seeking student input and
opinions concerning the project.

byMkhdleFidds contributing writer

Katzmar believes that the space
under the Majestic Complex will be ideal
for this type of occupancy. The main goal
of the proposal is to establish a place with a
club-like atmosphere with a bar. Only stu
dents ages twenty-one and above would be
allowed to drink, but all Gettyburg College
students will he admitted.

parties, giving students an environment to
safely and legally enjoy themselves.
Katzmar noted that "other schools of this
caliber have something like it, and this
would make us more competitive."
In a related effort to provide alter
native social activities, Senate sponsored a
BYOB "shrimpfest" and a concert by the
Pat McGee Band last Saturday evening.
Senators Emily Robertson ('00)
and Matt Eisenberg ('98) coordinated the
event. Eisenberg, who gives most of the
credit for the success of the shrimpfest to
Robertson, called the event "a step in the
right direction."
Eisenberg also stated that "SAC
did great stuff with Welcome Week," and

commented that he felt the campus as a
whole is moving towards finding alterna
tives to "just frat parties."
Eisenberg also said that ideas are
in the planning stages for more all-campus
social events, "it's in the works to set some
thing up with SAC and Senate, and some of
the individual fraternities." He noted that any
plans are vague at this time, but he stated an
interest in "Getting _theGreek system more
involved with the campus." The Senior sena
tor said that "we need to make the Greek
community part of the campus community."
He also credited the Commission
on the Future for their input, and said that
he felt that the campus has responded fa
vorably. "There's a lot more involvement
a very diverse involvement" he said.

Dr. Kerry Walters, Professor
of Philosophy, will be the speaker
at the first Common Hour lecture
of the 1997-1998 academic year.
Professor Walters will con
tinue the Common Hour tradition
of the "Last Lecture." The "Last

chance to speak to colleagues and
students as if it were his or her fi
nal opportunity to do so.
The Common Hour Commit
tee calls the Last Lecture "an op
portunity to showcase the personal
development of a scholar. The per
son who delivers the lecture and the
choices her or she has made are the
focal points of the program."

from Staff reports

The Last Lecture attempts
to offer insight into the lives and
philosophies of Gettysburg's fac
ulty members. The Common
Hour will be held today at 11:30
a.m. in the College Union Ball
room. A complimentary lunch
will be served following the lec

I heard it through the grapevine: Rumors, rumors, rumors

bySteveSpicer Contributing Writer
"Hey Kate, did you hear
about Sarah's sore chin?" That's
usually how it starts, nice and in
nocent (not that there aren't excep
tions). But by the time a rumor
hits the mainstream of campus
gossip, it's almost always ugly.
Let's face it: we live on a
small campus. There are only
2100 people here, so it doesn't
take long for news to spread. As
an example, think of that old long
distance commercial; you tell two
friends something, and they tell
two friends, and they tell two
friends, etc. It turns out, using that
logic, that a rumor would only
have to go through 11 generations
of being told before everyone on
campus knows it! And as things
go through multiple generations
they get mutated.

Simply because everyone
has heard a rumor doesn't mean
that it resembles the original story
in any way. Remember that game
Telephone? It's the game where a
silly sentence, "My cat is named
Barberella," for instance, is whis
pered from person to person
around the room, and usually
winds up sounding something like
"Your orange gorilla ate my cat."
If that happens to a simple
phrase, try to imagine what the
ninth or tenth person to hear the
news about you is learning. Be
fore you even know it, you may
be engaged to be married, have

some incurable disease, be con
sidering joining a cult, or just
be a slut.
These rumors are danger
ous things, so why do we even
bother with them? Because
they're fun--duh!!! I can't think

of one person I know who
would willingly dismiss any
gossip at all (at least, not the
good stuff).
Some rumors, though, are
famous. Not the kind that
evolve into an exciting and tor¬

rid tale, but the type that start out
that way.
One story that springs to
mind is the myth that if your
roommate is killed or commits
suicide, then you automatically
get a 4.0 GPA. Don't get your

hopes up too fast; there's appar
ently an exception if you are the
one who killed your roommate.
Sorry. Another, rather morbid,
tale is about a student who was
so frustrated during a test that he

authorized aid.
Gettysburg College has a whole
set of its own rumors and supersti
tions. So far this year I've already
been warned about the "Ghost of
Glatfelter,"which is a popular one on
many campuses. The story, as I heard

The important thing to keep
in mind is that rumors are just that
rumors. The definition of rumor,
according to the American Heritage
Dictionary, is "unverified informa
tion of uncertain origin usually
spread by word of mouth; hearsay."
So if you want the absolute
truth, don't put much faith in the
rumors. But if you want to know
what's really going on, you'd bet
ter pay close attention. Who
knows? This week's topic may be
you, or someone living in your
dorm, or even someone "unliving"
in your dorm.

shoved his official No. 2 pencils up
his nose and smashed his face into the
desk; he, supposedly, died instantly.
Could that be an Honor Code viola
tion? Probably not, since it's not likely
that he could've asked the students
who finished before him for any un¬

it, is that there is a female ghost in
Glatfelter Hall who lures young
men to the top of the bell tower and
then throws them off to their deaths.
Not a nice chick. Is it true? I don't
know, but I can guarantee that you
won't see me hanging around
Glatfelter at night to find out.
Another such story involves
the "Blue Boy" of Stevens Hall.
Apparently many, many, (oh, what
the heck) many years ago a small
boy was forced out into a cold
winter's night. He was forgotten
about, and then froze to death. It's
rumored that sometimes when it's
really cold outside, a young boy's
face can be glimpsed through the
windows. I suppose there could
actually be a spectral image, or
maybe it's just the face print on the
glass from the last person who
looked out the window trying to see
the ghost.

Alicia clueless in Baggage

byJonFr oehlich
Staff Writer "There was only one thing I
never could have anticipated,"
Emily Hope.
"Excess Baggage" is a
movie produced by twenty year
old actress Alicia Silverstone - and
it shows. This movie, directed by
Marco Brambilla, tells the story of
how its two main characters, Emily
and Vincent, are thrown together
under a set of circumstances more
ridiculous than those of your aver
age "Bugs Bunny" cartoon.

Emily Hope, played by Ali
cia Silverstone, ("The Crush,"
"Batman and Robin") is a rich,
annoying brat who chooses kid
napping herself as a way to get
daddy's attention.
Though the role of a rich
eighteen year- old princess should
be fairly natural to Silverstone by
now, she seems to have lost her
edge in this latest showing. The
innocent and fresh qualities that
made her so likeable in "Clueless,"
perhaps Silverstone's most popu
lar movie to date and the one that

pushed her into Hollywood's
mainstream, are largely unappar
ent in "Excess Baggage."
It is fairly clear that audi
ences are supposed to sympathize
with Emily on some level because
of her dead mother and emotion
ally distant father, but audiences
will most likely be repelled by
Emily's frustrated character rather
than drawn in by it.
The story of "Excess Bag
gage" really begins when Emily's
plan goes wrong as Vincent, a pro
fessional car thief, played likeably
by Benicio Del Toro ("The Usual
Suspects," "Big Top Pee Wee"),
steals her BMW with her hiding
in the trunk. At first, Vincent feels
just like the audience: that he has
just stumbled into the wrong place
at the wrong time.

From there on in, Excess
Baggage" inevitably turns into a
love story. Vincent forms an at
tachment to Emily, and soon finds
out that the feeling is quite mutual.
While this romance, perhaps, had
the potential to be entertaining, this
movie doesn't bother to explore it
very deeply, thus causing it to fall
into the common grave of unde
fined relationships and shallow
characters that is "Excess Bag
gage." Added, haphazardly, to the
premise for "drama" are cops,
guns, car chases and a few random

gangsters.
One of the many problems
with "Excess Baggage" is that it
tries too hard to be something that
it simply is not - a funny, bright,
fresh movie that explores the lives
of young people through a set of
comical circumstances. Though
this movie did have a few cute
parts and mildly funny lines, this
goal goes largely unfulfilled, mak
ing "Excess Baggage" about as
fresh as Nebraska seafood. While,
if done successfully, this mission
might have made an entertaining
movie showcasing the qualities
that we see in movies such as "The
Breakfast Club" and "Dazed and
Confused," "Excess Baggage"
simply doesn't do a very good job
of taking an idea and going some
where meaningful with it.

If this movie was indeed
supposed to be about being young
in today's world, perhaps the di
rector should have taken a look to
see how many of young people out
there are actually pro car thieves
and rich little girls who kidnap
themselves to get attention.
Judging from the director's
past credits and fromthe producer
of this movie, Alicia Silverstone,
the extreme incompetence of "Ex
cess Baggage" should come as no
surprise to viewers. With this
project, director Brambilla adds
another flop to his collection in
cluding "Demolition Man." At
least with this movie, Brambilla
simply keeps piling on one con
trived event after another for the
express purpose of trying to make
up for the movie's lack of direc
tion and focus.

Though Silverstone herself
tests and surpasses the limit of how
far a pretty face can get you in her
portrayal of Emily, the supporting
characters in "Excess Baggage"
were, actually, fairly decent, con
sidering the constraints of the ri
diculous story line.
Perhaps the best of these was
Emily's Uncle Ray, played by the
eternally cool Christopher Walken
("Pulp Fiction," "Last Man Stand
ing") whose shady and intelligent
personality helps him to play this
role rather well. Other decent per
formances come from Nicholas
Turturro ("NYPD Blue") and
Harry Connick Jr.("Independence
Day").
Sadly though, these perfor
mances were incapable of saving
"Excess Baggage" from being a
border-line disaster.

Sewage kills 3600 fish

byStephBusch Contributing Writer
On September 2, 1997,
Glatfelter Paper Mill experienced
a power outage which caused an
industrial waste spill into the
Codorus Creek, killing approxi
mately 3,600 fish.
The waste consisted of two
types of latex and clay from the
coater process, as well as paper fi
ber and residual fibers such as ti
tanium dioxide and calcium car
bonate. These containments were
released directly into the creek for

15-20 minutes.
The spill turned the creek
"milk white from bank to bank,"
according to Joe Roth, a Depart
ment of Environmental Protection
(DEP) official.
It is quite possible that these
fish died from oxygen depletion.
When the sewage was released into
the creek, the bacteria in the water
and waste began to break down the
organic material. Bob Schott, a
DEP biologist, said that this, in
turn, "speeds up the bacteria's me
tabolism and depletes the oxygen
in the stream."

The fish may have also died
from an abrupt change in the PH
levels, creating too alkaline an en
vironment for the fish to live in.
Fortunately, this spill will
not effect the drinking water be
cause there are no intakes down
stream from the mill, reported
Sandy Roderick, the spokes
woman for Pennsylvania's Depart
ment of Environmental Protection
(DEP).
Company spokesman Pat
Sweeney said, "We're just as up
set and concerned about this as
everyone else is. So we're look
ing at ways to...prevent this from
occurring again in the future."
Even so, in July of this year
there was a spill from the mill due
to a back-up and overflow in a
man-hole caused by heavy storms.
There were also fish kills in 1993
and 1978 due to Glatfelter pollu
tion. These spills were also both
investigated by Roth, who is look
ing into this spill.

It could be several weeks be
fore the DEP has lab results on the
water samples collected. A notice
of violation was sent to the paper
maker a week ago, giving the com
pany five days to respond.
Glatfelter must provide informa
tion on why the accident happened
and how the company will prevent

it from happening again.
Glatfelter normally dis
charges approximately 12 million
gallons of treated wastewater a day
into Codorus Creek, according to
Sweeney.
The paper mill is currently
operating on a discharge permit
that expired eight years ago, but
has been extended while work con
tinues on a new permit.
Glatfelter has been in busi
ness is 1864, and is a leading pro
ducer of book publishing papers
and technical specialty products
such as the paper used in making
postage stamps, playing cards, and
hospital gowns. The company em
ploys about 1,200 people.
Glatfelter Paper Mill is
ranked by the Environmental Pro
tection Agency (EPA) as the third
largest polluter in Pennsylvania.

Prof shows women are
the same everywhere

by Casey L Dunn
Staff Writer

tecture.' Through these courses,
and the symposium, the college
community will have the opportu
nity to learn more about the cul
ture and history of South Asia.
From the very beginning,
Aftab has been interested in
women's history and women's
studies. At the University of
Karachi, she was involved with the
women's studies program as well.
Aftab does not view the culture of
women in Pakistan to be entirely
different from the women in the
States. She says that the "prob
lems, issues, and concerns are the
same.". She relates that discrimi
nation is the same and that "if it is
happening here, it is happening
there." There are many obvious dif
ferences between'our culture and
that of Pakistan's. Aftab views the
United States as the "country of
options," and Pakistan as a place
of "limited options" and that "a
vast majority have no choices" in
cluding the area of marriage and
children.

Professor Tahera Aftab
quotes her mother saying, "as an
educated woman, you owe some
thing to all women...do something
for all of them." These instructions
from her mother have inspired her
to work in the field of education,
and more specially in women's
studies and history.
Professor Aftab of the Uni
versity of Karachi in Pakistan will
be a visiting professor and scholar
at Gettysburg this year. Her pres
ence here on campus works'well
with this year's symposium, for
which the theme is "South Asia:

The Next 50 Years."
Aftab, saw some "excellent
opportunities to share something of
her culture" here in Gettysburg, and
making this opportunity even
greater is that this year celebrates
the fiftieth anniversary of indepen
dence for South Asia. She also saw
teaching in the United States as a
gateway to being able to do more
research in the women's studies
field. Coming as a visiting profes
sor to Gettysburg also offered Aftab
the opportunity to be reunited with
her son, Faris Khan, who is a se
nior here at Gettysburg.

Here at Gettysburg, Aftab is
teaching three courses in conjunc
tion with the South Asian Studies
program this year. Her classes in
clude "History of the Indian Sub
continent", "Women in South
Asia", and "Islamic Art and Archi-

After only being in
Gettysburg for a little less than two
weeks, Aftab has liked what she
has seen. She comments that ev
eryone is "willing to help me."
However, she is a bit worried that
she may seem a little "rigid" to the
younger professors here on cam
pus. Overall, she has been im
pressed with the students and feels
that, as a whole, we should "ap
preciate the youth - they work
hard."

Dear Casey...

Dear Casey ,
I'mafr eshman. During
orientation I hung out mainly
with this girl. Since then, I've
made a lot of friends. I've dis
cover ed that my "orientation
fr iend" and I r eally don't have
much in common. I feel I need
to move away fr om her, but I
don'twanttohurtherfeelings.
She' sanicegirLjustnotmetype
I'dbefriendswith. Any advice?
-Stuck in Orientation
Dear Stuck In Orientation,
You met this girl in a time
of tremendous change in both of
your lives. At the time the two of

you met, you were so caught up in
college life that you really did not
know what you were looking for
in a friend. Perhaps you just
needed someone to pal around
with until you got yourself settled
and acquainted with those whose
interests compliment yours better.
Sometimes, these "transi
tional friendships" are hard to
break away from because of fear
of hurting another person's feel
ings. But you should realize that
moving away from someone is not
the end of the world. It happens
every day; people move apart, and
in the same way, people move
closer.

It is advisable to not com
pletely ignore this girl. Given
time, most likely the two of you
will naturally move apart if your
interests are as diverse as you
claim. If you let it happen natu
rally, then hard feelings should not
be a problem.
Dear Casey,
I dated a guy for several

months befor el decided to end
the relationship. Hedidnottake
_iteasily ,butlwasabletomove
on and have a r elarionshipwith
another guy for several months
after guy#l. Whenguy#2and
I broke up, guy #1 was dating
someonenew . Thenewgirlwas

afnendofmineJr ealizedlstill
hadfedingsfor guy#l,andnow
cannot take being ar oundthem
when they ar e together .Can you
help? -Leftover Feelings.
Dear Leftover Feelings,

Well, it seems that you have
made your bed and now you have
to sleep in it, regardless of how
crowded it is. What you thought
was the right thing to do at the time
now seems like the wrong thing.
This is tough advice. I strongly
advise that you, as one of my
friends often says, "suck it up and
deal." You say you can not stand
to see them together. If you still
had feelings for this boy, would it
not make you happy to see him
happy? The only small detail is

that he is happy with her and not
YOU. Try and be happy for him.
This situation is probably
also putting a strain on your rela
tionship with your friend. My ad
vice is to not let their relationship
cause a rift in your friendship. In
these upcoming years, you are
bound to date many men, but of
ten your girl friends stay with you
for a while. You can either try to
put a smile on your face and ac
cept what these events have
brought about, or sit around in your
room and sulk.The choice is yours.

Conflict and Consensus
Looking toward 2000: Too many candidates?

by John Dunlap
Staff Writer
With the election of Bill
Clinton to the Presidency
of the United States in
1992, the Democratic
Party controlled the
White House and the
Congress, as well as
most of the nation's
governors and state
legislatures. Today, over

four years later, Bill
Clinton is still President
of the United States, but
Republicans have picked
up 13 Senate seats, 41
House seats, 12 gover
nors, and over 500 state
legislative seats. The
Republican Party now
has control of virtually
every elected office, it
seems, on the national
level except the Presi¬

dency. In 1998 the GOP The GOP is notorious to

will most likely pick up
congressional seats
because in midterm
elections the party out of
power usually does
better. Without the
Executive branch of
government, you can not
get all of your agenda
through. The President
has his bully pulpit, his
veto power, now line
item veto power, and the
power of appointment.
No matter who is Presi
dent, he or she will be
the center of national
attention in the govern
ment.
This is why in the year

2000, it is essential for
Republicans to win the
White House back.
Republican nominees in
the last two elections,
President George Bush
and former Senate
Majority Leader Bob
Dole, only received 38%
and 41%, respectively, in
the popular vote. While
the Democrats look to
have Vice President Al

Gore as
their
front
runner,
the
Republi cans
have no
clear favorite
This is

Today there is a fresh crop
of Republican govenors
who are keeping their
promises and making
waves in their states.

very
unusual, though not
necessarily a bad thing

giving out its Presiden
tial nomination to the
most established or
already well-known
figure. Republicans have
nominated Thomas
Dewey, twice Governor
of New York, World War
II hero Dwight
Eisenhower twice, Vice
President Richard Nixon
three times, and Senator
Barry Goldwater. Actor
Ronald Reagan, Gover
nor of California, and
Goldwater's successor in
the conservative move
ment twice would stand
atop the Republican
Convention. Reagan's

Vice President, George
Bush, would be a two
time nominee. Many of
these men were success
ful, though in 1996,
when Republicans
wanted to portray them
selves as the "party of
the people" and of
reform, it was hard for
Bob Dole, one of
Washington's most
established figures, to

run on that platform. No
longer did the face of a
strong leader work
without the Cold War.
With the taint of scandal,
divided government, and
fierce partisanship in
Washington, the Repub
licans may be wise to
move out of the beltway
for their next party
leader. There are a host
of party insiders who
may seek the Presidency,
but each has his own
weaknesses. Consider
ing the lackluster presi
dential campaign a
Senate Leader ran in '96.

it is hard to imagine that
the party would nomi
nate Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott of

Mississippi. Despite
that, many party conser
vatives are angry with
him over numerous
issues. Speaker of the
House Newt Gingrich is
said to be considering a
run in 2000, however
with his scandal, his low
poll numbers, and some
of his own House depu
ties against him, it is
hard to imagine how he
could even run. Other

Washmg
tonians
who are
said to be
consider
ing the
Presi
dency are
Senator
Fred
Thomp
son of

Tennessee. Thompson
draws comparisons to
President Reagan be
cause of his acting career
and his ability to com
municate. While he has
only been a senator for
two and a half years, he
now is chairing the
Committee investigating
White House scandals
and while that may
surely give him national
attention, he can expect
the wrath of the White
House, which may hold
him back.
Today, there are a fresh
crop of Republican
Governors who are

keeping their promises
and making waves in
their states. Some are

better known than others
like the Governor of
Texas, George W. Bush,
who looms large in the
upcoming race. The
former President's son is
popular in Texas and is
already doing very well
in polls.
Besides Phil Gramm, other
'96 candidates are
looking to hop in like
former Tennessee Gover
nor Lamar Alexander
and publisher Steve
Forbes, whose flat tax is
growing in popularity.
The wife of '96 nominee
Bob Dole, Elisabeth
Dole, who serves as
President of the Ameri¬

can Red Cross, is being
tossed around. Mrs.
Dole showed great
campaigning skills last
year as she toured the
nation for her husband.
Having so many potential
candidates is not neces
sarily bad because while
a civil war is possible in
the GOP, it is sometimes
healthy to have a good
debate. Out of the list
that I have mentioned,
many if not most, will
not run, but with such a
strong farm team in the
works, then the Party of
Lincoln may be wise to
take a chance and give an
outsider the ball.

Welcome back...most of vou

I think I speak for most
Gettysburg residents
when I say that we're
delighted each fall when
you students return. It's
a pleasure to see you on
campus, and on our
streets. We've missed
your youth and vitality,
and your promise for the
future. Most of you, that

is.
Sad to say, there are always
a few bad apples among
you. A few, however, is
all it takes to leave a sour
taste. Each fall, you
announce your arrival by
tossing your cups and
beer cans into our gar
dens. This is an ongoing
ritual—as is the use of
our property as urinals.
Throughout the school
year, you keep us awake
with your parties, and
with the drunken mating
calls that follow-usually
in the middle of the
street.

At Christmas time, we can
count on you to cut our
trees, rip off our wreaths,
and hack our holly
bushes. Of course you
need to deface our
property, don't you, so
you can decorate your
rooms for a few days
before you go home
(where you can enjoy
your families' holiday
decorations).
And when spring comes,
you really get frisky.
That's when you rip our
our tulips and daffodils
out of the ground and
toss them on the side
walks. (You're so cute
when you're soused.)
When you've had your final
round of noisy parties
and Commencement has
come and gone, are we
glad to see you go? In
fact, do we wish you'd
leave right now? What
do you think? (As a
matter of fact, one or two

of you will probably
have to leave, after some
truly disgusting behav
ior.)
Wouldn't it be nice if this
year were different?
Wouldn't it be great if
you made some sort of
connection between your
own towns and homes
and families and ours?
Just like your families,
we take pride in our

homes, work hard, need
our sleep, send our own
kids to college, if we
can—and hope that
they'll take our values
with them when they go
Give it a thought, the
next time you feel like
tossing your beer cans
into our yards.
Maybe this year, we'll be
glad all of you came
back.

Consider this ....

The Gettysburgian is a
newspaper.
As a newspaper, it is
our duty to inform the
campus community. The
Gettysburgian staff proudly
fulfills the role of the fourth
estate, challenging authority
and searching for the truth.
Gettysburg College is
very lucky. We are fortu
nate to have a student
newspaper that functions
separately from student
government tne admin

ana -
istration. Numerous ac
counts tell of student news
papers shut down after
printing mildly controver
sial stories about adminis
trators or student govern
ment officials.
We at the
Gettysburgian are not
subject to such arbitrary
disregard of First Amend
ment rights.
We are protectors of
freedom—a charge we take
very seriously.
We determine the
content and coverage in the
newspaper. We are truly a
STUDENT newspaper.

We work closely with
attorneys at the Student
Press Law Center to protect
everyone's freedom of
speech.
Some readers have
been upset by our recent
coverage of some campus
events.
We have a responsibil
ity to report the news, no
matter how it may hurt a
certain fraternity's rush or
bruise someone's inflated
ego. When unpleasant
things happen, don't kill
the messenger; The
Gettysburgian reports the
news—we don't make it.

T _* *
Likewise, the
Gettysburgian does not, nor
will it, serve as a public
relations machine for any
given organization or office
on campus or off.
But our most impor
tant job remains to be
defenders of the public's
right to know. We are
indeed protectors of the
First Amendment.
The Gettysburgian is a
student newspaper.

Plagiarism or Inspiration?

To the Gettysburgian:
An article from College
Press Service in your
August 28 issue asks in
its title "Plagiarism or
Inspiration?" This item
concerns a service on the
Internet that provides
canned admissions
essays for students to
submit with their appli
cations to undergraduate_,
law, or business schools.
The answer to the ques
tion in the title is easy
plagiarism. We would
like to think that this
article was printed in the

Gettysburgian simply to
inform Gettysburg
students of a new kind of
unethical business that
they would, of course,
never personally patron
ize because the values of
the Honor Code (which
Gettysburg students
endorse) deplore plagia
rism in any context. To
make this point more
clear, we would have
appreciated comment by
your staff appended to
this article (which was
perilously close to an
advertisement for the
service) or in a separate

editorial that expressed
the moral distaste we all
should feel for such a
venture.

This Side of _Cyrnsim
Sex before liquor ..

by I. A.
Isherwood
Contributing Writer
For some terribly odd
reason when I came back
to Gettysburg this semes
ter, I imagined change,
something different, or a
more enlightened out
look upon the overall
nature of college life.
Without much percep
tion, the reader can now
imagine my deep regrets
that nothing was differ
ent except for a few new
posters and flyers in the

CUB. Still though, I
vowed for a positive
outlook upon my return
so that I could get the
best out of my
"Gettysburg experience."
When I saw my first
group of freshmen, or
first-year students to the
educated, my heart
dropped and sank into a
pool of tar (in which it is
still stuck), and my
optimism was shattered
into tiny bits throughout
the rest of my body. It is
not that I have a bitter

unbinding hatred for
first-year students, it is
just that I fear for them
and the humbling experi

ence called the Freshman
year. It seems as though
first-year students are
regarded as some of the
most open-minded
people who are on our
campus just because they
are naive to college life
and, most especially, the
seclusion of Gettysburg.
What I resent is the
molding process, the loss
of individualism, which

accompa
nies this
sort of
environ
ment and
possible emotional
effects of
such adaption.
Now, before
any of you
put away
this paper

I guess I'm just a bit old
fashined, or not quite up to
date with the latest dating
ritual or alcohol-indued
sexual entertainment.

or
this column as garbage,
at least listen to a few
remarks and helpful
criticism I have to offer.
First and foremost, the
most revolting situation
is the "Red Zone" for
which we see so many of
those striking posters
plastered across all our
halls. The situation of
freshmen girls is much
different from the situa
tion of men on campus,
in that we are not people

easily identified at
parties or other gather
ings for the drooling
lusts of others. Fresh
men women, mainly for
reasons of insecurity in
their new environment,
become not only targets
but victims of a very
cruel and sexually
deviant tradition on
college campuses. The
equation is quite simple

combine an insecure
young woman with a
lusting older male and
throw in some alcohol,
you have a dangerous
situation. I suppose
lusting is too open a
term, so we'll just refer
to Red Zone predators as
character-challenged
young men.
Maybe I'm foolish, but I
can't understand how a
situation so obvious, and
so terribly stupid, can

still exist ma civilized
society. I guess I'm just
a bit old fashioned, or
not quite up to date with
the modern dating ritual
of alcohol-induced
sexual entertainment. It
is a sordid catch and
release policy of corrup
tion. I am not speaking
out against dating,
norrelationships, but just
against using other
people for

temporary
pleasure.
Such
pleasure
can have a
lasting
emotional effect on
people and
we all need
to take that
into con
sideration.
We also

live in a world where
sexual promiscuity is not
the safest option out
there for young folks
and, the more such a
situation exists, the more
work those wonderful
people at the Health
Center will have with
unwanted pregnancy,
strange horrific STDs,
and even possibly the
AIDS epidemic. Such is
the dangerous nature of
the world we live in.
I would like it if people

would just open their
eyes a little to the nature
of the Red Zone, and
whatever other zones
they might think of next
for other problems. (By
the way, who thinks of
these flyers?) I was quite
alarmed by the poster; in
fact, I was frightened
until I realized it was not
meant for me or any of
my friends. The sad
thing is that the problem
is not overlooked nor
under-advertised, but it is
purposefully ignored by
those to whom it is
directed. Such is the way
of the world, for which

our campus is a minute
speck of dust upon.
Regardless of the comic
potential of such a
poster, it is a serious
situation that cannot be
understood because it is
so common. The Red
Zone factor is just one of
those little bits of college
"initiation" which we
can all live without, for

our safety and the rem
nants of dignity in our
culture. It seems to me
that problems are evalu
ated when the situation
becomes a problem, or
someone is seriously
injured. We should not
wait, not with this issue
and let us try to make
Month Two of this
period a little bit better
for all of us.

This Week at Gettysburg

The Civil War Institute (C.W.I.) of
Gettysburg College is proud to announce
its involvement with the
Adopt-A-Position program in cooperation
with the Gettysburg National Military
Park The Adopt-A-Position Program is a
new volunteer program for groups and
organizations that help care for Civil War
monuments, cannons, fences, stone walls
and other features on the battlefield This
program is modeled after the popular
"Adopt a Highway" program. The
National Park Service asks that interested
Civil War enthusiasts make a commitment
to help tackle historic preservation
projects which cannot be funded through
their shrinking park budget Our petition
was filed and approved over the summer,
and we have officially become the proud
"parents" of the 1 Ith Corps Line north of
the college Our first "assault" on the
1 Ith Corps Line is set for 900 a m on
Saturday, September 13, 1997. Those
interested in helping with this project
should contact the C.W.I, at extension

Freshman Anne Schenck was the
leader as she was fifth in the 100
(13.29), fifth in the 200 (27.13),
fifth in the high jump (4'9 3/4")
and was the lead leg on the sec

"Driving" through the
Conference

by Franc Candido
Staff Writer In the two weeks since the
season opener, the Gettysburg
field hockey team has played
games against Juniata, Rochester,
and William Smith colleges. De
spite how the win and loss column
looks, the Bullets are ready for a
season filled with drives, stops,
and plenty of highlights.
Right now the team has a
record of 1 -3, but dramatic perfor
mances, including a last minute
game winning goal by co-captain

Becky Griffith shows that there is
considerable potential for success.
For 1996, the team finished with
a 14-7 record in the regular sea
son. In Centennial Confrence play,
the team achieved an 8-1 record.
Presently, there are 34 play
ers on the team's roster. This
Bullet's squad is laced with talent
and returns 9 letterwinners from
last season. These players in
clude: Carolyn Anzalone, Tara
Chipko, Shanley Cooke, Laura
DeSario, Heather Donaldson,
Steph Fisher, Kim Fritz, Becky
Griffith, and Anna Spognardi.

"/ got nuttin but love fo' ya," says this Lady Bullet to her
opponent as she smashes the ball down field.
i i

Donaldson, Fritz, and
Griffith plan to lead this Bullet
team to high heights as they ac
cept the responsibilities as team
captians. Last season, Donaldson
started 20 games and made the
All-Centennial Conference Team.
Fritz spent all of the 1996 season
abroad. Remarkably, she has kept
all of her dope skills intact be
cause she has started in all of the
Bullets games this season.
Griffith must know how
to handle the rock because pres
ently she holds three Gettysburg
records for assists. Last season
she was featured on the first-team
all-conference, and second -team
Division III All-America teams.
Bullets Head Coach Carol Daly
is returning as well. Daly is a 1983
graduate of Gettysburg. In 1980,
she played on the team that cap
tured the Division III national
championship.

This rough start for the
Lady Bullets will definitely not
last long. This bunch of dedicated
women will settle for nothing less
than a Centennial Conference
Title this year, and they are aimed
and ready to shoot at the ever al
lusive crown..

GOODBYE "WHITEY"-

Longtime Phillies standout and color announcer passes away at age 70

On Wednesday September
10, a great era came to an abrupt
end. Richie Ashburn, beloved
baseball player and announcer for
the Philadelphia Phillies, died
Wednesday in a New York hotel
room. Traveling with the team as
their color announcer, Ashburn
was a trademark of the Phillies
broadcasting network, and along
with Harry Kalas, he created many
vivid memories for all Phillies
fans. Richie Ashburn played the
game in 50's along with some of
the most prolific center fielders
ever. Names like names Willie
Mays, Mickey Mantle, and Duke
Snider often headlined the news
paper, while the more low key cen
ter fielder from "Philly," quietly
put up numbers that would get
anyone into the Hall of Fame.

by Steve Jenkins
Sports Editor

As a player, Ashburn was a
two-time NL batting champ and
the center fielder on the 1950
Whiz Kids, Rookie of the Year in
1948, five-time all star (the only
Phillies Rookie ever to start and
All-Star game.) Ashburn batted
over .300 nine times and until
1995 was passed up in the voting
for the Hall of Fame.

Ashburn was a classic
ballplayer. He epitomized the
word hustle and laid down bunts
like they were going out of style.
As a lead-off hitter, Richie's job
was to get on base~and get on
base he did.
Ashburn was the bomb as he
led the league in walks four times,
in hits four times, and in triples
twice, and his career on base per
centage was close to .400. For all
you fans who do not understand
this stat, Richie reached base 40%
of the time he batted. Dare I say....
"EnFuego."
The thing that many people
know today about the great Richie
Ashburn was his voice and his
character. Along with Harry
Kalas, Ashburn joyously an
nounced 35 years of Philadelphia
Phillies baseball.

Richie was most commonly
known for his announcement of
the birthdays of Phillies fans.
"Gladys Westinghouse of
Newtown Square, Pa turns 102
years old today...She has been a
Phillies fan for all 102 of those I
bet.." Then of course Harry would
agree, and the two would go on
announcing the game, as if they
were blessed under some great
star. For so many years Ashburn
was passed over in the voting, and

A young Ashburn poses for a
picture as a member of the
1950 "Whiz Kids"

Phillies fans felt all of his pain.
After playing in an era where cen
ter fielders were dominating,
homerun hitting, base clearing
legends, Richie was denied the re
spect of many of those great play
ers even though he had compiled
some wonderful numbers.
Finally in 1995, Richie
Ashburn was voted in to the Ma
jor League Baseball Hall of Fame
in Cooperstown, New York.
Richie was enshired to
gether with Michael Jack Schmidt,
a Philadelphia Phillie that he saw
hit 544 career homeruns. The two
Phillies from two different genera¬

tions of baseball drew the biggest
crowd ever in Cooperstown,
28,000 fans strong, including 200
buses from Philadelphia. "We
have lost a cherished friend," said
Mike Schmidt, "you didn't have
to know him personally to con
sider him a friend."
If you were to ask someone,
"What do you think of when I say
Philadelphia Phillies?", undoubt
edly, one of the most prevalent an
swers would be "Richie Ashburn,
of course." Not only was Richie a
great man, but he was everything
that the game of baseball was sup
posed to be.

In an era when no player
complained about contract rene
gotiations, management disputes
or salary arbitration, Ashburn was
sliding in cleats first. He was an

As Chris Felton picked up the extra point that
junior Tom "smooth as silk" Olchon had just
knocked and ran it back ninety yards for a two point
conversion, he was probably thinking, "You know,
I bet I could make a damn good halfback."
Then, as if God were saying: "Felton, you
animal, just stick to defense," the lights went out
at Albright Stadium. Honestly. Expert football
analyst and sophomore defensive back Chris
"Sweet Lou" Lunardi reported: "It was one of the
most amazing things I've ever seen in a football
game...if I were Albright, after Felton made that
run, I would have turned the lights out too."
The Bullets did have an impressive showing
last Friday night in Reading, Pennsylvania. Al
though the unofficial score was 31-16 in favor of
Albright, Gettysburg played the number two team
in the nation for Divison III quite tough.
Leading the offense were full back Paul "You
can't stop me you can only hope to contain me"
Smith, who ran for 210 all purpose yards, of which
140 were rushing, and halfback Matt Helwig, who
scored two touchdowns for three and six yards re
spectively.

The defense looked strong in containing the
fearsome Albright offense. Led by Kevin "Chew
'em up and spit 'em out" Gurski, the Bullets held
like a wall until the fourth quarter when Albright
began to turn on the juice.
The defensive line also played very well with
Pete "Wild Man" Scaffidi gaining a sack and Gene

Kraus chalking up ten solo tackles.
Towards the end of the game, tempers flared
Chris Felton was ejected for fighting with an op
posing player. Said Felton: "Football is an ag
gressive game; sometimes the refs can't handle it.'

Full house

College adjusts to housing situation

Housing always ranks high
among the concerns of Gettysburg
College students, but this year hous
ing has become an even more prized
commodity.
According to the Office of
Residence Life, (he current housing
situation is not a housing crisis, as all
the students have beds to sleep in.
However, all of the accom
modations traditionally offered on
campus have been filled. The Col
lege has had to make some other op
tions available.
Gettysburg is currently leas
ing the Criterion Motel on Carlisle
Street. It is housing twenty-one first
year students as well as one Residence
Assistant.

There are also twelve spaces
reserved at the Gettysburg Lutheran
Seminary. The Seminary housing is
set aside for upperclassmen. There
are currently eight rooms in use, in
cluding one by the Residence Assis
tant. All of the rooms at the semi
nary are singles with carpets and air
conditioning. Although these hous
ing options are quite appealing to
some students, the question remains,
what has brought on this sudden on
slaught of students?
There are numbers of factors
that have influenced the current hous
ing situation. The most obvious rea
son for the lack of traditional campus
housing is the large number of stu
dents. The current class of first
year students, the class of 2001, is
larger than any other class on cam
pus. The College only planned on ap
proximately 620 First-Year students

The annual Cupola Society Celebration will be held Saturday
see related story—p 3

coming to Gettysburg this fall. Six
hundred forty-four, however, are now
on campus.
According to the department
of Admissions, the First-Year students
are not the only influencing factor.
There was a higher retention of
upperclass students as well. The origi
nal number projected by the College
for returning students was too low.
While these factors are both
potentially positive situations for the
College, it does create some problems,
housing being one of them.
Yet another reason for the
surplus of students requiring housing
is influenced by the fraternities. Many
of the houses are not filled to their full
est capacity. The displacement of fra
ternities from campus also played a
major role in the current housing situ
ation. When their housing was lost,
the College suddenly had to find beds
for many of the brothers of Tau Kappa
Epsilon and Phi Delta Theta.
Two final influencing factors
are more students who had withdrawn

returning to Gettysburg, and a decreas
ing number of students living off-cam
pus. Tim Rupe, Director of Resi
dence Life, believes that this is "a good
problem; it means there are more
qualified people here." Rupe believes
that the increase in the number of stu
dents, both new and returning, has not
only increased in quantity but in qual
ity as well.
Delwin Gustafson, Dean of
Admissions, does not believe that this_,
housing situation will affect the accep
tance rates for upcoming years.
The current housing situation
is an ongoing process, interlinking
many departments on campus. It re
mains to be seen what will happen next
year. Will there be enough beds for
all the bodies?

Is death an appropriate form
of punishment for those who have
committed a murder? This ques
tion has long been a topic of great
debate.
In 1983 there were a total of
five executions performed in the
United States; by 1990 that num
ber rose to twenty-three and this
year, the number has increased to
fifty executions. Many believe the
death penalty should be abolished
altogether. Others believe that ex
ecutions are an appropriate and
necessary punishment for anyone
who commits a murder. Lisa
Bartle, assistant director of the
Death Penalty Information Center
will be addressing Gettysbuig Col
lege on these issues during the sec
ond Common Hour of the year, to
be held next Thursday, September

Dean Nordval is head of the Gettysburg Coalition to end the death penalty

Courtesy of Church of the
Brethren

Jennifer Brown of
Upperco, Maryland, has recently
undertaken a one year Church of
the Brethren Volunteer Service
(BVS) assignment with National
Coalition to Abolish the Death
Penalty in Washington, DC.
The National Coalition to
Abolish the Death Penalty
(NCADP) was founded in 1976,
the year the U.S. Supreme Court
opened the way for resumption of
executions in the United States.
NCADP works with more than
one hundred affiliated offices
throughout the U.S. and serves as
a resource and coordination cen
ter for the movement to abolish
the death penalty. Jennifer's re
sponsibilities include sending out
requested materials, organization
the educational materials in the
office, and editing newsletters.

Jenn is a 1996 graduate of
Gettysburg College with degrees

in Political Science and Classics.
She was a member of Eta Sigma Phi
(National Classics Honor Society).
She has been involved in a number
of activities: Among others she vol
unteered at Hanover Hospital, was
part of Vision quest Youth Group
and worked with children in the
Sunday school of her church. She
enjoys drawing, playing the piano,
reading, arts and crafts, cooking and
baking. Jenn is member of Mt. Zion
United Methodist Church in
Upperco, Maryland.
Jenn's new assignment to
National Coalition to Abolish the
Death Penalty followed an orienta
tion in New Windsor, MD where a
group of 15 volunteers came to
gether from all over the U.S. and
Germany. For three weeks they
lived together as a community and
studied such topics as the death pen
alty, conflict resolution, welcoming
diversity and cross-cultural aware
ness. They also spent days work

Alum works to end death penalty

25. Lisa Bartle works with The
Death Penalty Information Center
to provide information and critical
analysis on issues concerning the
death penalty to the media and the
general public. The Death Penalty
Information Center does take a spe
cific stand on capital punishment:
they believe it is wrong. However,
Bartle will present both the pro and
con sides of the argument in her
discussion on Thursday.
Bartle will also focus her talk
on four prominent issues concern
ing the death penalty and society
today. These issues include racial
disparity, the execution of the men
tally retarded, the costs of the death
penalty, and the restrictions on ap
peals of persons given the death
penalty.

The issue of race has been a
major factor in determining the use
of the death penalty in murder

cases. Surprisingly, the biggest
predictor of whether or not the
murderer is sentenced to death
does not have to do with the race
of the murderer. The biggest pre
dictor is the race of the victim.
The Death Penalty Information
Center has found that those who
murdered whites were more likely
to be sentenced to death than those
who murdered blacks. This fact
reveals a whole new aspect under
the controversy of the death pen
alty, that of racism.
The mentally disabled are

another group of people who have
been singled out when discussing
the issues of the death penalty.
Many believe that executions of
the mentally retarded should not
be permitted because these indi
viduals are not always capable of
making morally correct decisions,
and therefore they should not be
as severely punished for their ac
tions. However, others believe
that the mentally retarded should
be responsible if they take some
one else's life and that they are
capable of knowing the difference
between right and wrong.

The issue on the restrictions
of appeals is also a great concern
for many in today's society. Re
cently the court system has been
discussing implementing restric
tions on how many appeals an in
mate on death row may have.
Many believe that such re
strictions will lead to the execu
tion of innocent people. If the
number of appeals are cut, it is
possible that new evidence could
arise on the murderer's favor that
would not be allowed to be heard
in court. The Death Penalty In
formation Center has stated in
their web site that since 1970, 71
people have been released from
death row with evidence of their

innocence. If in 1970 appeals had
been restricted to these death row
inmates, they probably would have
been killed.
The financing of an execu
tion is also a topic of great debate
today. The cost of the execution
of a prisoner is very expensive. For
example, Florida spent an esti
mated $57 million on the death
penalty from 1973-1988 to per
form eighteen executions, which is
an average of $3.2 million dollars
per execution.
Following Bartle's lecture
on the death penalty there will be
a fifteen minute discussion session
where students will be able to ask
questions and voice their opinions.
There will also be a complimen
tary lunch served after the lecture
which will allow students to con-

hie photo

tinue talking about this much
heated debate. Dean Nordvall is
hoping to have local attorneys at
tend the lunch to interact with the
students and to discuss any ques
tions or concerns they may have.
The issue of the death pen
alty is one of great controversy and
debate. Whether or not the court
system should be given the right
to kill someone raises many ques
tions about morality and ethics.
Unfortunately the majority of these
questions can only be answered
with various conflicting responses.
There is currently a group on
campus dedicated to the opposition
of capital punishment - The
Gettysburg Coalition To Abolish
the Death Penalty. Any students
interested in the group can contact
Dean of First-Year Students Bob
Nordvall.

Next Thursday s forum will
provide members of the College
community with an opportunity to
arrive at an informed decision re
garding this controversial topic.

College receives $250,000 challenge

Gettysburg College Press Release
Tom and Joan Norris, York
residents and 1960 graduates of
Gettysburg College, have an
nounced a challenge gift to their
alma matter of up to $250,000.
The amount of the final gift will
depend on fellow alumni match
ing their donation through new or
increased gifts to the College's
Annual Fund.
"The Norris Alumni Chal
lenge" will be in effect during the
College's current fund year, which
began on July 1 and ends on June
30, 1998. The Norris gift will
match dollar for dollar up to
$200,000 all new or increased gifts
by donors who qualify for mem
bership in the College's Cupola
society or Cupola Society Associ
ates.

The Norrises will also con
tribute $50,000 to the College if 40
percent of Gettysburg alumni
make a gift to the College's An
nual Fund by the end of the fund

year. During the most recent fund
year, 36 percent of Gettysburg
alumni made such a gift.
"Colleges such as
Gettysburg rely heavily on annual
gifts from alumni and friends to
help guarantee educational oppor
tunities for present and future stu
dents," the Norrises said. "We
hope our challenge will encourage
annual contributors to give a little
more and non-contributors to start
what will hopefully become an
annual tradition."
Tom Norris is the chairman,
president, and chief executive of
ficer of PH Glatfelter, Co., Spring
Grove, and a former Gettysburg
College trustee. Joan is a home
maker and daughter of R.M.
Wachob, a member of the Class of
1927. Tom and Joan are the par
ents of Cathy, a member of the
Class of 1990. In addition to their
past Gettysburg activities, both
continue in active volunteer work

for the College.
The Norris Challenge will

be announced on Saturday, Sep
tember 20, at the annual Cupola
Society Celebration held on cam
pus. Cupola Society membership
is granted to alumni who contrib
ute $ 1250 or more to the College's
Annual Fund. The recently estab
lished Cupola Associates program
grants Cupola membership to
younger alumni who have contrib
uted $ 100 for each year since their
graduation.
"The Norrises have always
set the example for service to
Gettysburg College in their many
gifts of time, talent, and financial
resources," said Gordon A.
Haaland, president of Gettysburg.
"The Norris Alumni Challenge
will serve as a wonderful catalyst
to boost our alumni participation
and increase the number of lead
ership donors to the Annual Fund."
The Norris gift will be used
by the College for a capital im
provement to be determined after
completion of the current fund
year.

Pell issue creates rift between four
year and community colleges

CPS Community college leaders
say they'll block any efforts by
four-year institutions to make Pell
grants tuition sensitive.
Associations represent
ing four-year public and private
colleges and universities have pro
posed tying Pell Grants more
closely to the cost of college. That
would make a student who attends
a costlier eligible to receive a larger
grant than if he or she enrolled in
less pricey institution.
However, American As
sociation of Community Colleges
members say "tuition sensitive"
Pell Grants would make it harder
for their neediest students to attend
college at all. They also fear it may
cause community college students
to migrate to four-year, public uni
versities.

"I don't think that our
students should be treated any dif
ferently, depending on where they
want to go," said Simon Visser,
associate controller for the City
Colleges of Chicago.
Visser says tuition-sensi
tive Pell Grants are unfair because
students attending lower-priced
institutions would not qualify for
the maximum grant.
On the other hand, the

As Congress moves to au
thorize legislation that would ex
tend the Higher Education Act,
which is due to expire this fall, the
debate over Pell Grants reflects a
wider policy question about stu
dent aid: Should the government
focus student aid on the neediest
students, or distribute it so all stu
dents can go to the college of their
choice?
Next year, the maximum
Pell Grant will be $2,700, "which
will go a long way in paying the
cost at a four-year school," said
Hnllhrnok.

American Association of State
Colleges and Universities is
strongly in favor of such a system,
saying it will allow some students
to attend member schools without
having to take out loans.
Ray Hallbrook, director
of financial aid at Tennessee Tech
nological University, supports tu
ition-sensitive grants. "The Pell
Grant isn't addressing the needs
that we have as a nation with re
gard to higher educational costs,"
Hollbrook said.
Hollbrook says most stu
dents pay a four-year, public uni
versity education with a Pell Grant,
income from part-time work and
loans. However, if Pell Grants
were tuition sensitive, students
could expect to receive enough
grant money to avoid the necessity
of a loan, he adds.

and universities, students have
fast, inexpensive (well, if you
don't count tuition) access to the
Internet and all it has to offer.
Well, what does the
In tenet have to offer? What
doesn't it have to offer? Students
can, with merely the touch of a
finger, access a huge body of in
formation and services.

Many students use the web
as an in-room library on which
they can do research for papers.
The New York Times and maga
zines such as Time can be ac
cessed online, as can a few peri
odicals not found in the library.
Sophomore Carrie
Mercadante had to research a
myth for her Latin class, so she
turned to the Internet: "I looked
it up, I found everything I

needed, and I didn't have to go to
the library."
The Internet can be used to do
certain types of research, but for
many projects, it does not provide

psychology major remarked that her
professors did not feel her Internet et

sources were reliable and were
reluctant to accept them.
Some Spanish classes now
have students perform verb i
exercises online, and several
of the first year seminars re- i
quire students to set up web
pages. While the value of the
Internet as a research tool can- i
not be underestimated, many
students simply use it for en- i
tertainment purposes.
"I sometimes use it for
research, but not really,"
sophomore history major i
Amy Lucadamo said. U
Students can access web
sites of their favorite actors, au
thors, movies, Broadway shows,
musical groups and television
shows. No matter how crazy you
think you are for liking something,
it is entirely probable that some
one else has already set up a web
site centered around it. 5 _I _j

While the value of
the Internet as a
research tool cannot
be underestimated,
many student use
the Internet for
entertainment
purposes possibilities are " endless.
The Internet also has many
practical applications. News and
weather can be accessed twenty
four hours a day. It can be used to
find cheap airfares, and even to
purchase tickets and make _res>er
vations.
TV Guide can be subscribed
to online, and many towns have

home pages that include the local
newspaper.
Another aspect of the
Internet is that of "chatting"—
" speaking" with others across the
country, even across the world,
about random topics.
According Brent Martyn,
1 who heads the WZBT radio sta
tion web page, the web can be
summarized in a single word —
advertising.
"I've been hired to do web
pages; I use them to advertise.
The web is the next generation

totally outweighs the informa

Exploring the web for ei
ther work or play has changed
with the rapid advancement of
internet browsers. Martyn, a jun
ior computer science major, pre
fers Communicator 4.03.
He has also experimented
with the new Internet Explorer 4.0

culties, offers an intuitive perspec
tive into the advancing browser
technology, he indicated. i-

Improvements in browsers
are only some of the changes ex
pected to be made within the next
year.

and moie Martyn also foresees more
interactive programming to for the
Net, as well as programs such as
Cyber Patrol and Net Nanny to pro
tect younger users from porno
graphic web sites.
"I think there will be a lot
more self-censoring devices,"
Martyn said.
As for search engines,
Lucadamo, along with many other
web users, prefers "Yahoo!" be
cause it is the most user-friendly
and comes up with the largest num
ber of useful sites.
Martyn also recommends
"Savvy," which is similar to "Ya
hoo!" but possesses broader
searching capabilities.
"It incorporates all the
search engines. So if you're really
searching for something, use
'Savvy,'" Martyn said.

Though the Internet is not
the best tool for research, it is a
spectacular resource for almost
anything else. It is simple to use,
even by the most inexperienced
person, and can open up a whole
new world of random facts, intro
duce you to people who share even
the craziest of interests, and adds
a whole new dimension to procras
tination.

The new class: 2001 largest class ever to hit the 'Burg

byKnstenHeider Contributing Writer
We are well into the month
of September, yet many of the
first year students still remember
their first days at Gettysburg
College. Six hundred and forty
six new students arrived on Au
gust 24, making the class of 2001
the largest class to enter
Gettysburg in the history of the
college.
Where did all these fresh
men come from? The class of
2001 comes from thirty states
and eleven foreign countries.
There are students from as-far
west as California, and many
others are from Gettysburg's
home state of Pennsylvania. On
my floor alone, there are girls
from stales such as New Jersey,

New York, Connecticut, Pennsylva
nia, and Tennessee, to give a fairly
typical representation.
Why did these students decide
to leave their hometowns and come
to Gettysburg? There are any num
ber of reasons why people selected
Gettysburg over other colleges to
which they applied. Most of these
reasons deal with the academics and
the many opportunities offered at
Gettysburg.
Yet for many, financial aid
played a large part in why they chose
Gettysburg College. In fact, when I
spoke with a number of freshmen,
financial aid was the first reason to
pop out of their mouths. This shows
that students not only have to find
schools that rank high in academics,
athletics, and opportunities, but also
one that fits in their budgets.

Another factor they consid
ered was the friendliness of the
people here. That's something I
remember from Get Acquainted
Day. I couldn't walk five feet with
out a student or faculty member
saying hello or just smiling at me.
It really made me feel like part of
the college.
For the class of 2001, 3777
students applied to Gettysburg, and
2706 were accepted. Out of those
2706 that were accepted, 646
chose to enroll.
The ratio of men to women
in the latest freshmen class is al
most equal. 52% of the class are
women, with the other 48% being
male. This may be interesting, but
not necessarily a reason to attend
Gettysburg (particularly if you're
female).

These numbers are fairly
similar to those for the class of
2000. That year had 3884 students
apply, with 2547 being accepted.
632 students enrolled, with a ratio
of 55% female to 45% male.
It isn't just the college that
offers many different opportuni
ties, but the students as well. As I
have said, we have freshmen from
thirty states and eleven foreign
countries. This gives Gettysburg
a very diverse population which
makes everyone's experience all
the more interesting and exciting,
It is important for Gettysburg to
have diversity because even
though this is a small town and a
small community, we need to see
the big picture. The students at
Gettysburg can see a small piece
of the world when the campus is

diverse.
To ensure this diversity, Ad
missions targets high school vis
its, makes special telephone calls,
and communicates specifically
with students of color that are in
terested in Gettysburg. Admis
sions believes it is important to also
give the current students that add
diversity to the college a good ex
perience. Every individual at
Gettysburg makes the college a
more diverse setting.
The class of 2001 is only the
latest addition to the Gettysburg
community. Through its four years
here, many things will change.
And diverse as they may be, the
students who graduate in 2001 will
always have Gettysburg College to
tie them together.


Students in London give new perspective to Di's death

London Students
Contributing Writers
Audrey Uf fher
II is hard lo express in writ
ing what I have witnessed in the
twelve days since we arrived in
London. We were so excited to be
a part of another culture, one
thought to be so close to ours.
Little did we know this trip would
be so much more than we could
have expected. I will never forget
what I have seen or experienced in
these last few days.
Nothing prepared us for liv
ing in a mourning nation. The
world we were just beginning to
know changed overnight - literally.
The news was so shocking, we

could barely believe it. There was
a feeling that this moment in his
tory, this tragedy, was something
we could feel and experience, but
not completely understand.
Many of us made our own
"pilgrimages" to the palaces of
Kensington and Buckingham that
same day. I do not know what it
was that made us go. I was not
totally prepared for such intense
feelings, the immediate outpouring
of grief. The scene, though cap
tured by many photos, comes short
of the feeling of standing at the
gates of those palaces and seeing
the sorrow, tears and flowers of so
many who probably never met the
woman. It was odd to know that I
was so much at the center of such
an event.

I remember someone in
the group made a remark that 1
agreed with: "This, must be
what the United States was like
at the death of JFK."
A nation mourning is
something to experience; one
could see a visible change in the
way many people acted, as if
human mortality was realized
and pondered by a whole nation;
as if for perhaps a few moments
they saw that even a princess can
meet with an untimely death,
anytime, before we have a
chance to live life to its fullest

extent. Many of our group can
recall a day many years ago,
watching a young and impres
sionable woman walk down the
aisle in St. Paul's Cathedral to
become a princess. Through the
years, we've followed her life
through all its joys and sorrows.
On Saturday we sat to
gether in a different country,
surrounded by our new friends,
separated from loved ones, to
watch that same princess talk
her last "walk" down another
aisle in Westminster Abbey.
Once she had walked; this day,
she was carried while those who
loved her and work with her
looked on with tears and looks
of disbelief.
We, though citizens of
another country, felt the love for
such an inspirational figure and

abioad sham views
realized the impact of her shoil
presence with us.
Yes, we have lost a won-
derful person through a horrible
tragedy, but I feel that it had
made people rcalue that what
you do in life matters and affects
many people, as well as the face
that life, even for those we con-
sider to be above death, is a frag
ile thing that should not be taken
for granted.
JillMacArthur-
I did not follow the events
of her life as many others have,
so although it was a shock to find
out Diana was killed in a car
wreck, it did not affect me.
How can I feel sorrow for
someone I never knew person
ally? Naturally I feel bad for her
friends and family.

Although I may sound
cynical, I often wondered if
people only waited in lines for
hours to sign the condolence
book just to have their name there
rather than because they truly felt
sympathy. It seems that many
people only wanted to go to the
funeral procession to say they
had been there rather than to pay
respects.
I am sure there were a mix
ture of native mourners and tour
ists who sincerely cared as well,
but I did not go because I had no
reason to be there.
Living in London at this
time did not alter my perception

on'
\
mc (
anc sor
m tragedy from a diffe
of events, but I fell close to the heart
of what was occurring. I only wish
now CNN and the local papers would
let this go.
Erin Quay -
What I have experienced and
witnessed in the past week has proved
incomparable to any previous event.
Due to the death of the Princess
of Wales, thousands of teary-eyed
men, women, and children lined the
streets of London. The funeral pro
voked tears from a whole country, as
they all felt touched by the unique
Princess.
The day of the funeral, the
streets were void of people and cars,
and the only sound was that of many
televisions playing the funeral in uni
snn.

Being here for this tragic event
has left me feeling very distant from
these people. I was shocked and sad
dened upon hearing about the devas
tating death, but these people have felt
the hurt the deepest.
I do not believe that we have
anyone in the United States who
would have this strong effect on so
many people.
The image of Prince William
and Prince Harry walking behind their
mother's casket is one that I will never
forget. I have never seen a whole coun
try mourn like this, and this has proved
to be a very chilling experience.
Kristen Blanco -
I find it difficult to put into

rent point of view
words my feelings about the death
of Princess Diana, mainly because
I'm not exactly sure of these feel
ings. To me, her death still does not
seem real. When I saw the head
lines Sunday morning, I kept think
ing that it was all a joke - a tabloid's
plot to attract the reader's eye and
make money.
However, even after watch
ing the funeral, I still have not fully
accepted the fact that she is dead.
This is not to say, however, that her
death has not affected me. Rather,
it is a loss that has affected me a
great deal, a feeling of loss intensi
fied by the fact that I am living in
London.

As tragic as the loss of Diana
is, I feel almost fortunate that I am
so close to such a historical event,
yet at the same time, I feel almost
intrusive.
It is amazing to see how
deeply the British mourn the loss
of their Princess, and, as an Ameri
can, I feel as if I have no place in
this grieving.
This is the first in a series of
articles written by the students
spending this semester in London
and Essex, England.

Roberts drops
the bouquet

byJonFr oehlich
Staff Writer "You have a small but dis
tinct window of opportunity to do
the right thing." - George
"My Best Friend's Wed
ding," starring Julia
Roberts("Prelty Woman," "Con
spiracy Theory") as Julianne Pot
ter, is the story of a woman whose
life and self-image are shattered
when she discovers that her per
fect man and best friend since col
lege is marrying his perfect woman
- and it's not her.
With the only thing that
Julianne could always depend on
having fallen through, she takes it
as her mission to break up her best
friend's weddi. g and take the
groom for herself.
While it is unclear exactly
how we are expected to react to
Julianne's character, audiences
will most likely find her to be de
vious and selfish. While viewers

may enjoy seeing how low she can
go, the scheming Julianne quickly
loses her charm, leaving audiences
hoping that she'll finally do the
right thing.
Though viewers might not
enjoy Julianne as a character, the
movie tends to compensate for this
probable reaction by having all her
little plans backfire. It is in this
that we see the comedy and enter
tainment that "My Best Friend's
Wedding" has to offer.

Most everything that
Julianne does to bring out the
worst in the bride of "her" man
actually ends up emphasizing her
perfection and infuriates Julianne,
to the delight of viewers.
Though Roberts is the star
of "My Best Friend's Wedding,"
much of the plot is worked out very
well through the characters of
George, Kimmy and Mike. With
a terrific amount of acting talent,
these three characters support the
plot well and prove to be much
more likeable than Julianne.

George, played by Rupert
Everett ("The Madness of King
George"), is Julianne's good friend
and editor who is unwittingly
pulled into her scheme to break up
the happy couple.
Though he eventually be
comes just as sick of the whole
thing as audiences will tend to, he
initially finds his role to be an in
teresting and fun challenge, when
Julianne tells everyone that he is
her fiance. In what is perhaps the
best scene in the movie, George
tells how he and Julianne met in a
mental institution.

Cameron Diaz ("Feeling
Minnesota," "She's the One") is
Kimmy Wallace - the bubbly,
twenty year old that is set to marry
the man of both her's and Julianne's
dreams. Her near perfection and
comments on spring break annoy
Julianne to no end, but will most
likely charm audiences.
The other half of the perfect
couple is Mike O'Neal, played by
Dermot Mulroney ("Young Guns,"
"Bad Girls"). He suspects Julianne
of nothing and accepts her pres
ence as a gesture from a true friend
as any normal person would. He
only discovers Julianne's true mo
tives when she guiltily admits it to
them following her success. The
light comedy and emotion of "My
Best Friend's Wedding" come
when Julianne, with the words "be
careful what you wish for..." ring
ing in her head, is forced to undo
her damage and finally come
clean, to the relief of audiences.

This sparse drama, added
to a few very entertaining scenes,
make "My Best Friend's Wed
ding," while not very memorable,
possibly worth your money.

Prelude leads to true love

In Case You Missed I

by Glen Beck
Staff Writer
What if the person you loved
was not the person you married?
That is the premise of the 1992
film, Pwlude to a Kiss, based on
the play written by Craig Lucas.
Directed by Norman Rene, the film
is a contemporary fairy tale with a
not-so contemporary plot twist.
Alec Baldwin reprises the
role of Peter Hoskins, a part that
he played in the original off
Broadway production. The movie
also stars Meg Ryan (Rita Boyle),
Kathy Bates (Leah Blier), Ned
Beatty (Dr. Boyle), Patty Duke
(Mrs. Boyle), and Syndney Walker
(Old Man).
The story unfolds as
Baldwin and Ryan meet at a party
and dance gawkily into each
other's hearts. He's boring and
geeky. She's totally energetic. The
cliche of opposites attracting cer
tainly applies to their situation.

They instantaneously estab
lish a relationship filled with per
sonal secrets and cute phrases.
Soon alter, Peter proposes and Rita
accepts. Right before the wedding,
Rita slips into Peter's dressing
room and the couple engage in
conversation.
Peter tells Rita that he loves
her, and Rita questions, "What
about when I'm a hundred years
old with a mustache and yellow
teeth." He assures her that he will
still love her. "And when I'm sag
ging down lo here and I'm bald?"
"I'll love you all the more,"
he replies certainly.
In any fairy tale, something
must happen, and it does here, too.
Right on the mythic cue, at the
wedding, mysterious well-wisher
Walker gives Ryan a kiss. Sud
denly, Ryan is not quite herself,
and Baldwin must find out what's
wrong and save her. The movie
then shifts into high fairy tale gear,

bringing an intriguing dimension
to the story.
The acting is very well done.
Baldwin handles the shift in his
character well. Ryan is her usual
cute and charming self (well, be
fore her change, that is).
Duke and Beatty are hysteri
cal as the Boyles. They are awk
ward, naive and insane, which
makes you love them even more.
But I'd have to say that
Walker deserves the most credit for
the movie. He is extremely believ
able in his portrayal of the dual
sided character. Near the end of
the movie, he delivers one of the
most moving monologues I've
ever heard (which would make a
good audition piece for all you
Theater majors out there).
So if you are looking for a
good date movie, I'd suggest rent
ing this one. But make sure you're
in a sappy mood with a profound
state of mind before you watch it.


Ross's Reads more than a restroom

byKabir Kumar
Staff Writer "Our washroom is available
to whomsoever wants to use it,'
says Ross Hetrick, owner of Ross's
Reads, a used-book store on
Middle Street in Gettysburg thai
also serves gourmet coffee and of
fers a wide range of magazines and
newspapers to its patrons.
"I hate signs that say 'Wash
rooms are for Patrons Only'," he
adds. His cafe/bookstore does not
restrict any outsider from using the
washroom. In fact, people are free
to walk into Ross's Reads, browse,
lounge in the upholstered chairs
and couches and, walk out with
out spending a dime.
However, Hetrick advises
otherwise. "I have the best froth
anywhere," he says, describing his
cappuccino, which he has per
fected over the last fifteen years.
"People are truly impressed by my
froth." However, whipping up
frothy cappuccinos and welcom-

Pholoby MarkAstrom
ing people into his store is not what
Hetrick has always done. He used
to be a financial reporter for the
Baltimore Sun before he moved to
Gettysburg.
Hetrick worked on the staff
of the Baltimore Evening Sun for
14 years and then worked another
four years from 1991 to 1995 with
the Baltimore Sun. "They were
downsizing and I took a buy out,"
he says.
But there were other reasons
that also played a role in his
family's decision to leave Balti
more. For his work on various
community organizations, Hetrick
and his family were harassed on
numerous occasions. One evening
they confronted a teenager who
threatened to tear down their
Christmas lights.
"We had enough," says
Hetrick.
He and his wife had vaca
tioned in Lancaster and Gettysburg
and had liked them. They decided
to move to either one place or the
other. But when it came down to

the final choice, something
other than a small town ap
peal played an important
role. Thaddcus Stevens,
popularly known as "The
Scourge of the South," be
gan his career as a lawyer
and politician in Gettysburg.
"He is, according to me, the
most famous unkown per
son in history," says Hetrick.
Stevens was the leader
of the Radical Republicans
during Reconstruction, and
right up to his death fought
to prove that all men are
equal. Hetrick has a framed
copy of Stevens' epitaph
hanging in Ross's Reads that
says he was buried in a
"mixed" cemetary.
Hetrick, somewhat of
a history buff, greatly ad
mired Thaddeus Stevens and
decided that he would start
his new career in
Gettysburg.

He and his wife
bought a bed and breakfast
called Country Escape, six
miles west of Gettysbuig
and later, in March of last
year, opened Ross's Reads
in a Civil War building on
Middle Street.
"The coffee cups that
we are using today I bought
two years ago," says
Hetrick, adding that owning
a place like Ross's Reads is
what he always wanted to
do. "I definitely don't miss
the day to day reporting." he
adds. He says that there is a
fundamental difference be
tween reporting and owning
a small business. As a reporter,
he probed into other people's
affairs, but as a small business
owner he enjoys the fact that
people come to his shop for a

conversation.
Hetrick also carries a
'laid back entrepreneurial' per
sonality which he picked up
from an individual named
Sandy MacAdams he knew
while he was at college.
MacAdams owned a large
bookstore as well as a little
French restaurant. "That is the
type of person I would like to
be," says Hetrick.
"What I want to prove is
that business can be fun - it can

Ross's Reads offers many varieties of coffee to their patrons
along with the house specialty: frothy cappucinos

be creative and a benefit to the
community," says Hetrick. "And,
of course, profitable."
It is for this reason Hetrick
plans to extend his hours on Fri
days and Saturdays to 11 pm. He
has scheduled folk music perfor
mances and poetry readings on a
number of Fridays in September.
He has also helped organize the

Photo bv Mark Astrom

Gettysburg Book Festival at his
bookstore on the 27th of Septem
ber. Hetrick hopes that his phi
losophy of "if you have a good
product people will come" will
prove itself as more and more
people, especially Gettysburg Col
lege students, visit his store and
cafe - even if it is only to use the
facilities.

Dear Casey...

Dear Casey,
I have a pr oblem. lama
sophom' / e and am ver y in
volved with various activities
here on campus. I did not r eal
izethatmyworkloadwouldhave _increasedsodrastkallyfr omlast
year andfoundthatlam having
trouble balancing ever y thing in
myliferightnow . Anyadvice?
Thanks,
Overloaded Dear Overload,
Seems like you have a prob
lem that many college students
tend to have. The key to the prob
lem is balance. It is extremely dif
ficult, and sometimes emotionally
distressful, to cut down on activi
ties and positions that you really
enjoy doing.
The reason you are in col
lege, though, is to benefit from a
quality education. By no means
should you sacrifice your aca
dem'c learning, --our sanity, and
your health to be involved in ac
tivities. _i .
i _i

detrimental to your health and your
lifestyle. After all, they are what
they arc called, extra.
Dear Casey ,
I work with this guy in
whomlamsor t of inter ested. I
think he knows that I like him,
but I am having tr ouble r eading
him. Lately he ha" been wink
ing and smiling at me in the of
fice, and I do not know how to
interpr et his actions. Please
help. Thanks, Confused
Dear Confused,
Did you ever tell him your
feelings for him? If not, then he
might be testing the waters by get
ting your reaction to his flirtatious
maneuvers. You probably know by
now how the rumor mill works,
and if he has heard a rumor, he
might be trying to justify it, in a
rather roundabout way.

It is also possible that he
might think he knows the truth and
is trying to be funny or friendly, or
just plain stupid. Some people fail
to realize that others might be con
fused or even hurt by their actions.
Actions do speak louder
than words sometimes. Next time
he pulls a flirtatious stunt, pull one
back, but be creative. Let him
know that two can play at this
game of love.
This guy sounds like he
could either be a rambunctious
fellow with an innate flirtatious
quality, or a pompous and obnox
ious individual who does not de
serve your time or attention. Yout
opinion is your own, just be care
ful. Good luck.

What it _sounds like you need
to do is sit down and do a little soul
searching. Make a list of all that
you do and review it carefully.
What are the things that you can
cut out, or cut down on? Think
about what is central, and what
isn't. A mistake that many college
students make is spreading them
selves too thin. This only means
that you would be hurting not only
all the organizations you are com
mitted to, but also your personal
well being.
Bottom line: extracurricular
activities are meant to be fun, not

~ a little cash for good ideas ~
During the '97 - '98 academic year the Office of student Activities & College Union is happy
to support approximately nine student ideas each semester that bring a small group of stu
dents and the campus community together in The Junction, Patio, or Cafe 101 in the Bullet
Hole for a special program We have established a fund (up to $100.00 a program) to offer
students who are interested in turning their idea into their own program. The
program may be targeted to an audience or group as small at 5 or as large at 100.
It is our intent to support ideas that would otherwise not necessarily come to fruition
without a little funding and to support ideas that are not affiliated with an already funded
group. We are certain that students have an abundance of great ideas! We are glad to meet
with you to dicsuss the merits of your idea and how you might be able to make lagniappe
magic. We may not be able to fund all ideas, but we will try.

Letters to the Editor
Put down the pen, propose solutions, prepare for action

Mr. Isherwood,
I commend and applaud
your efforts in an attempt to curve
sexual abuse and alcohol abuse on
this campus. I feel your efforts and
words are something that in an
ideal world, or as you refer to it, a
civilized society, would be greeted
with praise for their honesty and
direction. However, while your
article is quite eloquent, I am not
sure it proposes any realistic
course of action, or really any
course of action at all.
Perhaps I am confused. Are
you claiming that these "Red
Zone" signs are unnecessary? Are
you saying that they are necessary?

Or are you appalled that we need
them at all? Perhaps it is a little of
any of these, but would you prefer
that our college community go
uninformed? The Women's Cen
ter in partnership with the college
has taken a huge step in the edu
cation of our community when it
comes to the issue of sexual abuse.
Their efforts should be supported
by every person on this campus—
from the President of the college
to the most rambunctious student.
If these Red Zone signs save even
one person from a situation where
they could be injured or raped, isn't
that fact alone enough to continue
on with this course of action? I

have known too many women who
have been the victims of this crime.
If these signs that you seem to feel
are so tasteless and appalling are
at the same time effective, then
why should the college stop using
them? I agree, the Red Zone signs
are quite frightening, but that is the
point. Perhaps I am misunder
standing here, but you seem to
claim that you don't understand
how rape and drunken hook-ups
with "Red-Zone predators" can
exist in a civilized society. Sir,
who ever claimed that college is a
civilized society? We, at a school
like _Gettj sburg, have a small com
munity where we can get to know
many of the people on campus,
attend classes regularly, and have
a good time. Perhaps this sounds
civilized, but I say this is as far
from "civilization" as we can pos
sibly get. You see under each of
the aforementioned ideals, there is
a Mr. Hyde lurking.

We may get to know many
people on campus. We might be a
member of a Greek organization,
or we might not. We might be on
Student Senate, or part of the
Women's center, or have a pro
gram on WZBT, where our voices
can be heard by any who care to
listen. But all these connections
mean nothing when one of those
people who we believe are so close
to us, hurts us in an unimaginable
way. Remember, there are very
few cases of someone jumping out
of the bushes and dragging a
woman into some deserted alley.
These "Red Zone Predators" are
usually the ones you seeeveryday
in classes or in clubs.
As for the idea that we each
come to college to have fun, in
some way, shape, or form, could
this statement not be more true?

When I think back on my last three
years here, I remember the times
when I was with my brothers, or
went on a date, or played my gui
tar. It's not just about classes. In
the words of Mark Twain, "I never
let schooling interfere with my
education." But fun is a relative
term. What is fun for you may not
be fun for your friend, or parents,
or teachers. Our good times are
curbed by the limitations put upon
us by those we surround ourselves
with. We do not have a license to
do as we please.
So what can you, or anyone
else in the college community do?

For God's sakeTHINK!!!! Before
going to that party, don't drink,
especially hard alcohol. I have
done this, I have had those random
hook-up nights; in fact I've had too
many of them. I am still trying to
live down a reputation that was
established in my first semester of
college. Some of my friends, those
people who I am close to, still con
sider me this person who treated
women so poorly his freshmen
year. The person who is writing
this response is no longer the na
ive freshman, but a determined,
feeling, caring member of this
community, but it came at the cost
of his honor.

Mr.Isherwood, you write
that your heart sunk when you saw
these naive freshmen and yet all
you do to help them is write an
article in the paper condemning the
hard work of the college and the

efforts of the Women's Center. Do
you believe that your article will
put a halt to something that could
prevent dangerous situations? In
stead of defaming these people,
work with them. Volunteer! If you
disagree with policy, change it,
don't bash it. It won't do anything.
I am a firm believer in the saying
that actions speak louder than
words. Perhaps when I was a
freshman, a few words from a con
cerned friend might have helped
me dispel the myths about my
character. So all I can do is offer a
few words advice.
Gentlemen, and I am speak
ing to each of the men on this cam
pus, understand that no does mean
no. I empathize that it is very dif¬

ficult to control hormones, espe
cially when intoxicated. However,
is it worth hurting a friend and
possibly going to jail? Remember
sex can be a wonderful release, and
an incredibly pleasurable experi
ence. But if she is resisting you,
or she is too drunk to fully partici
pate, you are lowering yourself to
the animalistic standards. Some
men may enjoy being animals, but
we are supposedly on the forefront
of higher education. Can we at
least try to show it? If you are with
female friends at a party, keep an
eye on them. If you see one of
them hooking up with someone,
make sure they leave with you. In
a drunken stupor they may be an
gry with you,

but I bet they thank you the
next morning. Also, be careful,
those actions that are not always
noble have the potential of getting
you in trouble.
Women, there are many
ways you can remedy this prob
lem. One, never go anywhere
alone, especially if you have been
drinking. 99% of the time, the
male is going to be stronger so
unless you really trust the guy you
are with, don't put yourself m any
situation where you can be over
whelmed. Basically, please use
your minds. Don't let hormones,
or someone's golden tongue charm
you into doing something you
aren't willing to do.
As a final note, this is a prob
lem that must be attacked from a
variety of angles. Women, talk to
men, communication is ultimately
the key to solving this problem.

Men, be receptive, but also don't
be afraid to ask questions. You
won't lose any face by asking a
question you feel is silly. Besides
its better to understand now, than
to be in the dark sitting in prison.
You see folks, communica
tion and education are the keys to
solving this problem. As a male I
cannot even begin to imagine the
horror of rape. To anyone who
reads this article please realize
what it means to be raped. You are
not simply engaging in the act of
sex, you are forcibly and
animalistically asserting your will
on another. To any of you possible
rapists, imagine someone else of
your mindset hurting someone you
care about. How many sisters, or
girlfriends, or friends, have had
their lives permanently changed by
this heinous act? Please, I know
this article rambles on, but for once

in your lives think of how the
other person is feeling. If there
are any doubts, stop.
Mr. Isherwood, your article
proposes no solutions, nor is it a
progressive model for change at
our institution. Being old fash
ioned is fine, so long as it doesn't
interfere with the noble work of
those striving to end this problem.
Remember your morality is not
that of the person next to you.
Help them to see your world view.
If you care so much then act. I,
as well as others respect your
opinions and words, but I don't
find much use for them.
Respectively submitted,
With hopes for a better to
morrow,

Beyond symbolism
into substance

I appreciated that there is
someone out there who also sees
an avoided issue. I remember the
programs we required to attend
during the first semester at
Gettysburg. We were bombarded
with sexual assault programs. At
best groups like CHEERS gave
some women a good scare for a
day or two before everything went
back to normal. At worst was a
guest speaker who insulted the
men, polarized the audience, and
accomplished little in education.
The article by Mr.
Isherwood addresses a topic we
ignore beyond the first week or two
of our freshman year. But he stops
short. We have a surplus of edu
cation on this campus and it has
done nothing to change the situa
tion. Not one red poster on the
walls has prevented a woman from
being victimized.
I am not saying that we
should end the education or post
ers. I am saying they are only a
part of the solution. But in order
to change a negative situation we
must be willing to go beyond sym¬

bolism and enter substance. If you
are not following me, let me give
an example. During AIDS aware
ness week we all put a little red
ribbon on our coats and feel good
about helping out. In reality a red
piece of fabric doesn't prevent a
single person from contracting
AIDS, fund a single researcher, or
even comfort the dying. Only an
action of substance can do these
things. In the situation of rape
there are very few actions of sub
stance we can do. One is remov
ing alcohol from the mix. I am not
a prohibitionist. But we must rec
ognize that the laws of this state
must be obeyed. If you are under
21, don't drink. The college can
help enforce this if they will drop
the slap on the wrist punishments.
This would be substance.
Since coming to this college
I have known of at least three rapes
all involving alcohol. This led me
to change many things in my own
life and outlook. I can only ask
the campus, "What are you pre
pared to do?"

Conflict and Consensus

Pachyderm's Pulpit:
Communications key to solving
campus problems

byJohnDunlap
Staff Writer After what seemed to be a
very quick summer, we are back
to Gettysburg, and while there are
a lot of new faces, Gettysburg re
mains the same. This is year num
ber two for me here at College;
year number one was very memo
rable. It did have its highs and
lows, many more highs than lows.
Not only did I have great profes
sors and fairly interesting classes,
I joined a great fraternity and
made friendships that I am sure
will last a lifetime. Beyond that I
had the time of my life. However,
as I am sure the freshman, sorry I

mean politically correct, first-year
class already knows, Gettysburg
has its problems, one big prob
lem that I would like to concen
trate on is Penn Hall. For those
who were not here last year, dur
ing the early part of the second
semester, our College's president,
Dr. Gordon Haaland, and the
school's leadership came under
enormous scrutiny on a wide
range of issues. Issues ranging
from the tenure process to getting
only one day off for Easter Break.
The issue that seemed to epito
mize the College's leadership, or
lack there, of were Dr. Haaland's
frequent and long lasting sabbati
cals.

The criticism of the Presi
dent and the College Administra
tion did bring about an interest
ing debate on the state of Gettys
burg College. When the President
came before the student body in a
Town Hall Meeting, he was bom
barded with questions on a wide
range of issues. One positive re
sult, found in last week's Gettys
burgian, is the President's more
frequent Town Hall Meetings.
One of our biggest problems is
that there seems to be a discon
nect between Penn Hall and the
rest of the campus. Dialogue can
do a lot, and if students feel Dr.
Haaland is on a particular prob
lem then that goes halfway to
solving the problem.
The President should try to
meet as many students as possible.

II he were to pay an occasional
visit to dorms and talk to the stu
dents then that could do wonders
for student-administration dia
logue. It is a shame that most stu
dents at Gettysburg can not even
recognize their President. Not
only should the President try to
reach out more, but he should use
the Provost, Dr. DiNicola, and
Dean Ramsey. President Haaland
cannot be everywhere, but he
should try to get out more. As a
student senator, I would love to be
able to welcome the President, the
Provost, and Dean Ramsey to more
our meetings; we are the elected
representatives of Gettysburg Col
lege. Another powerful commu
nication tool for Dr. Haaland
would be to write an occasional
letter to the Gettysburgian on what
he is doing and what is not only
his agenda for the College but his
vision for ourschool. I would even
be willing to let him use the
"Pachyderm's Pulpit" from time to
time.

A problem which has grown
tremendously in my short time
here at Gettysburg is the deep ani
mosity between the administration
and the Greek system. As a Greek,
I see a deep level of distrust which
has existed and is only growing.
The Greek system feels very un
certain and fears for its survival.
As the College cracks down on fra
ternities, drinking is increasing in
the dorms. I saw it last year, and I
see it even more this year. The
other day, as I walked past Stine
Hall, I found it interesting to hear

a freshman state, "I am tired of sit
ting in my room all weekend all
weekend getting wasted." Perhaps
Dr. Haaland, fraternities are not the
biggest problem when it comes to
substance abuse. With last week's
bushings in Ice House and even
Apple, it seems like students need
to be able to get out more. Last
year's transfer rate seemed very
high, and at this rate, it seems like
it will only grow higher. The Presi
dent should try to visit some
houses and talk to sorority bisters
about the future of Greeks at
Gettysburg's campus.
The leadership's problems

do not stop with students but with
the faculty and staff as well. With
the denial of tenure of Dr. Edward
DeCIair of the Political Science
Department and the sudden firings
of two librarians, confidence in the
administration has dropped among
the higher levels. Working in a
College department, I hear com
plaints day after day.
For those who do not know,
Dr. DeCIair is one of the most in
teresting and finest professors at
Gettysburg. While his teaching
style is rather unorthodox, his Eu
ropean Union Class dominates the
simulation year after year, and
when tenure was denied, students
across campus rallied to his side.
Sadly, he will leave at the end of
the year so I suggest students try
to take a class of his before he goes.
He will make you talk, and he will
make you mad, but you will learn.
It is a shame that a professor can
be that popular to have student
petitions started but have Penn Hall
ignore our wishes. We pay the
bills; please do not forget that.

As for the librarians, this is
not a business; it is a community.
A community where we live, work,
and learn. With as much waste as
I see here, those librarians who
work hard and were loved by many
students did not need to go. Rather
than relieve the librarians, let's
start with some of the waste, such
as last year's Student Senate spon
sored one thousand dollar activism
speaker or five hundred dollar
GECO speaker. I could get Pat
Buchanan, or even Jesse Jackson
for you lefties, to come talk about

activism. Guess what-they would
not want a dime.
President Haaland and the
entire administration need to spend
less timeworrying about
multiculturism and diversity and
more time working on the prob
lems of Gettysburg College today.
We have to lift our morale, and if
the President and his team do open
up more, then we students must
work with Penn Hall and talk back.
President Haaland can not be ev
erywhere, but if he were to cut
back on some of his sabbaticals
then that would be a start.

Consider this ....

Soon we will all be facing a
_dificult question. A question that
will test our moral and ethical char¬

acter. A forum will be held next
Thursday to debate the death pen
alty. Every student, professor and
member of the college community
should attend.
Not only is the discussion of
capital punishment a challenging
and intriguing debate that forces
one to evaluate the meaning of life,
but it is an issue that we as a com
munity may have to wrestle with
in an intimate fashion in the com
ing months.
Beginning next month, our
classmate and friend will be on
trial for first _iegree murder.
_Prosecuters may try for the death
penalty if he is convicted.
Each and every one of us
will be forced to carefully consider
the consequences of the death pen
alty in a very personal way. The
national debate on captial punish
ment that has been raging for years
will finally hit close to home.

No matter what our personal
beliefs may be, we will all have to
make tough decisions in the com
ing weeks.
The key is to make a defi
nite decision.

Often we choose the middle
path to "be safe." This is the easi
est, and often the most taken, route.
As educated, enlightened individu
als we should try to see all sides
of an argument.
Although it is good to rec
ognize the many sides to a debate,
sooner or later we all must make a
choice and take a stand.
Should Brian Peterson die?
Should Timothy McVeigh die?
Where is the fine line that decides
who should and should not die?
There are large factions both
for and against the death penalty.
Where you stand depends
very much on how you were
brought up, your religious beliefs,
and your moral background.
Some people agree with the
death penalty because they believe
that it is a waste of taxpayers'
money to house prisoners.

Others believe two wrongs
don't make a right; an eye should
not be taken for an eye. For them,
the death penalty is simply cruel
and unusual punishment, a viola
tion of the Constitution itself.
Stop living in a foggy haze,
go to the forum, and continue the
debate in your classes and dorms.

Sara says :
get involved

bySaraSpr enkle
Managing Editor

the first year's relatively easy
classes cause an unfounded belief
that one can take on many more
activities than before.
I know I get a lot of flack
from my friends about being too
involved, but some of them are too
involved themselves. What I won
der is what are all the other people
doing? It seems that I could give
up some of my activities to some
one else.
SAC is given such a hard
time about concerts, etc., but very
few people put in the time to get
those events organized.
The Center for Public Ser
vice has lots of different events.
Involvement at CPS means getting
to know people from the College,
as well as the local community.
Service Learning trips are a great
opportunity to go off campus to a
place that you might not otherwise
get to travel to.

Enough about the pioblems
of this campus. Well, soit of
Enough about the usual complaints
about Gettysburg College.
Sara says: On a small cam
pus like this where we clamor for
more opportunities for alternative
activities, why are people not more
involved in organizations around
campus?
The opportunities are abun
dant and it's quite easy to get in
volved, but there are always people
who want something different,
something that Gettysburg College
doesn't offer yet. Not that that is
bad, if the grumblers then work to
form the groups that are wanted.
These ambitious people are
causing the number of student or
ganizations to increase. I've al
ready seen many signs for the
Japanese Club and the Civil War
Club membership drives.

New organizations seem to
get a lot of devoted members early
on (hey, it's new, it's different), but
then they disappear. Maybe mem
berships dwindle and interest is
lost. Students have that kind of
reputation. (Speaking of reputa
tions, did anyone else catch that
Link's articles about Generation X
were very sexually skewed? If you
hadn't thrown your copy on the
mail room floor, you would have
noticed!)
There hasn't been much
noise from last year's very vocal
group, Students for Ethical Action.
Last year, the student digest con
stantly had notices about their next
meeting.
This year's fad seems to be
the campus radio station WZBT
91.1. The turnout of people who
wanted radio shows was the larg
est it's ever been. What's the big
attraction for the station? WZRT

has drawn in all classes of student,
not just first-years, the much
sought after warm bodies who still
are interested and want to get in
volved before classes get too tough
and they get too involved in their
major. The involvement roller
coaster seems to peak in the sopho
more year when confidence from

Being involved doesn't nec
essarily mean joining an organiza
tion. There are plenty of other
ways to get involved without hav
ing a strict meeting schedule to
adhere to.
You'd be amazed how pro
fessors notice what you do. (Of
course, when you screw up, they
might mention it to you, but they
still know what you arc doing.
When you do something good,
they notice that too.) Attending
Common Hours and Faculty Meet
ings does not go unnoticed.
Common Hour attendance is
terribly small (not that I'm not
guilty of the peccadillo). I think I
have only attended five Common
Hours in my two years here, al
though I have attended nearly all
the Mathematics & Computer Sci
ence department's colloquia.

Unfortunately, there seems
to be a lack of respect for faculty
among some students. Although
occasionally there will be some
interest in a professor (like the
clamoring for Dr. DeClair's tenure
or a large turnout for a professor's
last lecture), students lack respect
for faculty, like the faculty owe stu
dents something for their tuition
dollars. (How many of us have
actually used this argument when
we don't do so well on a test?)
What does this have to do

with being involved? Becoming a
teacher's assistant or going to de
partment colloquia allow a student
to know a professor on a totally
new level. Conversations are not
limited to the classroom. Surpris
ingly enough, many professors
have favorite sports teams that they
are more than willing to talk about.
(I mean, they do lecture, among
other things, for a living, so they
should be good conversationalists.)
This is a small campus, duh,
but we tend to get set in our ways
and not meet as many people. We

run into the same people on a daily
basis, and we get stuck in our ruts
with our groups. Being involved
means meeting new people.
Want to gain the respect of
your peers? Go to sports events.
Attendance is smaller than at most
high schools. Even our "big"
sports, like football, men's basket
ball, and lacrosse, don't get that
much support. Gettysburg has
some of the best athletics teams in
the Centennial Conference, but
they don't attract as many fans as
some of the worse teams.

Okay, so I may be a little
bitter that the activities that I am
involved in are having trouble at
tracting new blood, but that's okay.
I know these things fluctuate, and
our time will come. I just don't
want to hear anyone else say that
there is nothing to do on campus.
You just have to look for it.
Get involved.
Oh, I mean, Sara says, "Get
involved."

From the donkey's mouth:
Helms's one-man
government

byMattBr own
Contributing Writer
You know, I do not think any
of us has ever learned in any
American Government or any po
litical science class that one sena
tor, one committee chairman in
Congress could be as powerful as
the President of the United States
and single-handedly veto the
president's decisions. However, if
you have ever watched events un
fold in our nation's capital over the
summer and just this past Monday,
you have learned that Senator
_Jes._ie Helms do3_s in effect have

quasi-power to veto President
Clinton's decisions. Over the
summer, you have seen the chair
man of the Senate Foreign Rela
tions committee, Senator Jesse
Helms, effectively veto President
Clinton's choice for Ambassador
to Mexico, former Massachusetts
Governor William Weld. On Mon
day, the nation saw that Mr.
Helms's refusal culminated in
Governor Weld's withdrawal of
his name for consideration to the
important post, a decision that has
upset many in Congress and many
across the nation.

How can this ultra-conser
vative Republican senator from
North Carolina end Weld's nomi
nation? Well, Senator Helms has
the power to not hold a confirma
tion hearing, the first step the sen
ate must take to fulfill its Consti
tutional duty to confirm the
President's nominations. In his
refusal to hold this necessary hear
ing Helms effectively hijacked the
process by which our government
approves political appointments.
As chairman he is allowed to wield
this great power and disrupt our
country's foreign policy. This he
is able to do despite the objections
of member of his committee and
of his very own Republican party.
Where did Senator Helms get this
power? Certainly not in the Con
stitution, rather this power is in the
rules that the Republicans, as the
majority party, get to set that gov¬

ern the business of the Senate. If
one man can do this, hold up the
confirmation process, maybe it's
time to consider a little reform in
the rules.
let's be fair though, why
don't we take a second to consider
Governor Weld. Perhaps this mod
erate Republican really is as ter
rible and unworthy of being an
ambassador to our neighbor and
friend to the south. Now, Helms's
whole reason to hold up Weld's
nomination was because he did not
believe Weld's record on drug
fighting was strong enough. He
believes, but repeatedly denies it,
that Weld is too moderate. Well,
why not hold a public confirmation
hearing? If Governor Weld is re
ally not suitable, why not show the
whole country Mr. Helms? The
reason why there were no hearing
was that Helms and other conser
vatives like him did not want to

expose their weakness—that there
is no real reason that Weld should
notbe ambassador. Weld has re
peatedly proven himself to be a
good leader as Massachusetts's
governor and as an attorney and as
an attorney at the federal and state
levels. The people of Massachu
setts seem to think he's a good
enough crime fighter to re-elect
him and give him good marks in
opinion polls. Weld must be doing
something right to enjoy support
from both sides of the aisle. Some
of his most ardent supporters have
been Democrats: John Kerry, his

opponent for the U.S. Senate, and
Ted Kennedy also from his home
state. If William Weld had faced
the fires of confirmation, he would
have won overwhelming support
from Democrats and centrist Re
publicans. Americans do not share
Jesse Helms's and other ultra-con
servative Republican's vision of
America and what her policies
should be. Mr. Helms seems to
think that he speaks for all of us
when he knows how important it
is that our Ambassador to Mexico
have a closed mind to the possibil
ity that marijuana may indeed have
beneficial medicinal uses. It seems

that the medicinal establishment
agrees more with Mr. Weld's
stance on marijuana that on Mr.
Helm's support of tobacco use.
It's even questionable that
Helms's, a known racist, who used
race bating to get re-elected in
1990, should hold a position in
Foreign Relations when by its
very nature the job requires good
skills with people of other races.
Governor Weld should have been
heading for Mexico City this week
and Mr. Helms should be heading
back to North Carolina. Leaders
who are so partisan that they
would halt our democratic pro
cesses for their own selfish politi
cal ends have no place in our
nation's leadership.
It's not William Weld who
lost this week, it's the American
people. We Americans lost a man
who would have been a fine leader
in a pivotal diplomatic position.

We saw how one man can affect
the way our nation conducts its
business. Partisan politics contin
ues even as President Clinton
reached out and chose a Republi
can for a top diplomatic post. The
effectiveness of President
Clinton's foreign policy through
all this adversity continues to be
strong. The senate, including
Jesse Helms, continues to follow
the strong leadership of President
Clinton and Secretary of State
Albright in the foreign policy
arena, especially on Most Favored
Nation status for China, the role

of U.S. troops in the Dayton Peace
accords and out role in the Mid
East Peace talks. Governor Weld
will not be out of the picture very
long. Although he has said he will
not seek another position in the
Clinton Administration indica
tions point to his returning to pub
lic service soon. Weld is a strong
moderate leader for a strong mod
erate America, who was an ex
ample of courage standing up to
the right. President Clinton will
continue his strong leadership in
the foreign policy arena and cer
tainly will have just as strong a
candidate forAmbassador soon.

You 'd never know
that Mother Teresa
died; Princess Di
takes the cake

By AurenHof finan
On the back page of every
newspaper was the biggest story of
the week: Mother Teresa, after a
lifetime of love and achievement,
died. But unless you really paid
attention, you would have thought
that the only person who died last
week was Princess Diana — be
cause she was on the front page of
each of those newspapers and
magazines. Diana's death was
very tragic (especially considering
her youth). Famous people who
die young (James Dean, Jack
Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe) in a
tragic death usually instantly
double their popularity. But con
sidering Diana let herself be driven
around by a man far drunker than
the legal limit (who drove 4 times
the legal speed limit), her death
was not just an accident — it was
bad judgement.

Two of the most famous
women of the world died that week
and their lives could not have been
more different. Diana, gorgeous
and vibrant, was born to a gentile
old-money family. She married
the Prince, then divorced, and then
led a life photo-ops.
Mother Teresa (born Agnes
Gonza Bojaxhiu) was certainly no
beauty. She was short, very aver
age, and born to grocery store
worker in Macedonia. She mar
ried the Catholic Church and never
got divorced. In the almost 70
years since Mother Teresa made
her commitment, she never wa
vered. Diana brought recognition
to many of the world's problems -
- and for this she should be com
mended. But Mother Teresa actu
ally helped solve some of the
world's problems. She built over
500 hospitals in over 100 countries
to help the poor. She fought the

Calcutta slums. She inspired mil
lions to do good. She did this not
with glamour or for self-want ~
she did this because she cared.
Maybe some Americans
who sit in front of the tabloid tele
vision, the Dateline NBC Hard
Copy Sally Jesse Opera Prime
Time Live marathon that persists
everyday, never heard of Mother
Teresa. Maybe some people don't
know her good deeds are her help
ing combat disease, isolation, and
poverty.
But these same Americans
probably know of the nasty divorce
he.tween Di nnd Charles.

That's sad.
That's really sad.
Some people might blame
the press for promoting Diana,
scandal, andother non-issues -- but
the media is not blame. We are to
blame. It is a sad fact that putting
the beautiful Diana on the cover
of Newsweek is going to sell more
magazines than the old Mother
Teresa. When the people of this
country are clamoring for garbage
- that is what the free market is
going to give them. Garbage has
infiltrated our market - even some
notable publications (like
Newsweek and Time) appeal to the
lowest common denominator.

Though it is understandable
for Americans to look up AT the
glamour and the royalty of a Prin
cess — most Americans should
look up TO people like Mother
Teresa. And though most of us will
never be as devoted or have as
much impact as Mother Teresa,
many of us will live much happier
lives than Princess Di.

Could it ever really happen?

BySteveJenldns
Sports Editor
It's Friday night. You are
kickin' il dance party somewhere
on campus, and the most
bodacious woman you have ever
seen in your life, looks at your
studly, yet smooth body and says,
" Hey what to you think about
Roger Maris' record? Will it ever
be broken?."
Your eyes were glowing
with anticipation with the hopes
that maybe, just maybe, she was
going to ask you out to LD's to
share a Lumberjack special. "Uh,
uh..." you stumble. Not realizing
what you are about to mutter you
say," Oh that record is going down
the tubes... Can you say Ken
Griffey Jr."
"Nah, nah, nah," she says,
"Griffey and McGwire were good
this year, but not good enough, the
way I see it that record will stand

Not wanting to offend her in
anyway (because her personality is
overwhelming you) you say, "
Look, have you seen the size of
Mark McGwire's arms, the gov
ernment makes him carry a special
license for that kind of weaponry.
And Griffey, shoot, if that boy hit
any more bombs, they would have
to call him World War Junior."
After your witty response,
you figure you have stolen her
heart, swept her off of her feet and
garaunteed yourself a woman.

"Ahh, too many injuries..." she re
plies as she throws her hair back
over her shoulder.
"What... what did you say?
Did you say they get hurt too
much?" Dumbfounded, you step
back and realize that she has made
a point. Ken Griffey Jr., Mark
McGwire, Albert Belle, and Frank
Thomas (some of the most preva
lent power hitters in the game)
have all missed a number of games
in the last two seasons that may
have kept them from eclipsing the
great mark of sixty one "dongs" in

a season.
"That was just dumb luck,"
you retort, "there is always next
season." Yes, you finally made a
good point. So they missed a few
games here and there. That doesn't
mean that they will never break the

record. You are set. Nothing like
breakfast in bed.
"Ah but do you think that it
is neccesary to play all 164 games
in a major league season to do it?"
she asks. "I mean Cecil Fielder
was the last player to come even
close he hit 51 homers in 1990, and
he only missed a few games that
year." "No!" you say. "Roger
Maris only played in 154 games
the season that he hit his 61 round
trippers. Griffey or McGwire
could do it. Not a problem." You
stare into her eyes, and you can see
that in her innermost soul she
knows that you are right. The
record will be broken; it is just a
question of when.
"I guess you are right," she
admits, "but sixty- two homers is
alot. Let's say that a player bats 4
times per game, and he plays 165
games. That means barring any in
jury, and playing a full season, a
player would have to hit one
homerun every 10.64516129 at
bats. Now that is impressive."

Impressive indeed. This
woman has just spurted some in
formation at you that seems like
some foreign language, and the
fact is, she is right. To hit sixty
homeruns, a player who plays ev
ery day, never slumps, and who
sees the ball as big as a water
melon, would have to hit a
homerun once every 10 or 11 times
he steps up to the plate. Wow.
It is hard enough to get a
basehit in the major leagues, not
to mention a homerun. The fact
that Roger Maris achieved this
small miracle in 11 less games than
professionals now play is a won
der to modern sports. This is what
you have to explain to her, that
Roger Maris' feat was glorious, but
some day it will be broken.
"Records are made to be

broken, you say, it is just a mat
ter of time... somebody will do it."
You've got her. You have changed
her mind, and she is yours for as
long as you can keep her inter
ested. Baseball is so universal, you
can even talk to girls about it."
"So what are you doing
now?" she asks, "I thought we
could go get something to eat,
maybe LD's." PAYDIRT. Bring

on the Lumberjack special. You
see there are a few things in life
that remain sacred. Some think
that Roger Maris' record will for
ever remain untouched, and some
think that it will be broken. The
record for homeruns in a season is
61. A number that may never be
reached again. You, yourself, will
be the one who has to decide.
So the next time a luschious,
beautiful, bomshell of a woman
comes up to you and asks you, "
What do you think of Ken Griffey
Jr?" tell her, "Hey, he's good, and
the record, well, only time will
tell." You are almost gauranteed
to be the highlight of the party, and
women will be throwing them
selves at your feet!

Mens
soccer fired
up for tough
season

from the Gettysburg '97 Men' s
soccer preview
This season, many pieces
appear to be there for Gettysburg
College to have another succesful
men's soccer campaign in 1997.
The top three scorers from
last year's squad are all back. That
includes Gregory Stevcic, who al
ready holds the school record for
career goals. The trio of Stevcic,
Brian Hill and Chris Pryor com
bined to score twenty goals and
dish out 13 assists last season.
Aaron Jolin, used as both a
forward and a midfielder in his first
season at Gettysburg, responded
by supplying the Bullets with two
goals and five assists. The coach
ing staff is looking for Matt Kelly,
who collected three goals and five
assists last year, to have his finest

season this year.
Also returning for the Bul
lets is John Katerba, who started
all 18 games last season in goal.
He was credited with 83 saves and
allowed just 14 goals in 1, 633
minutes, and tied a school record
for shutouts in a season.
The area that was hit hard
est by graduation was the defense.
Noah Simon, a four year starter
and the 1996 Centennial Confer
ence Player of the Year, and Scott
Metzger both concluded their ca
reers with the Bullets last season.
That leaves Josh Rubinich and
Derrich May as the only returning
backs with more than one start in
their careers, although Jumpin'
John Malcolm, who appeared in 15
games last season, has shown he
has the tools to be a solid Division

III defensive back.
Thus far in the season the
Bullets are 3-2, and are playing
quite well. With a few more games
to gel as a unit, and get the shots
blastin' there is no telling what this
bunch of athletes can do.

Sport Spotlight

Tri this on for size...

by Chesha Miller
Staff Writer Few students take on as
much as Kelly Haberstroh. Last
year there were five, but with the
turn of the semester there ore only
two left and Haberstroh is the only
student. What, you may ask, are
there so few of? Triathletes. Kelly
Haberstroh and Professor Scott
Johnson are the two remaining
triathletes on Gettysburg's cam
pus. A triathlo is a race consist
ing of swimming, biking, and run¬

ning. There are a few different
types of triathlons and each type
has a different mileage for the three
disciplines. The Sprint Distance
Triathlon, which is a typical dis
tance and the most common type
of race, consists of a half mile
swim, followed by a twenty mile
bike, and finally a five mile run.
Olympic Distance races have a .9
mile swim, a 25 mile bike, and a
6.2 mile run. The final type of
triathlon is the Half-Ironman,
which involves a 1.2 mile swim,
56 mile, bike, and then a 13 mile
run. Whew!!

Haberstroh is indeed a brave
person to take on all that! She be
gan her career as a triathlete dur
ing her senior year of high school.
In high school, Haberstroh swam
and ran in addition to playing soc
cer. She also found herself with a
natrual talent for biking. Her first
race, held close to her New Jersey
home, was very successful.
Haherstroh has been hooked ever

. Since that first race, she has
competed in over 30 triathlons,
taking place primarily in southern
New Jersey along with a few in
Pennsylvania. Most often she
competes in the Sprint Distance
triathlons, however her favorite
distance is the Half-Ironman.
Haberstroh explains, "It asks the

most ot your mind and your body,
but gives the most in return."
Becoming a triathlete takes
a lot of work, dedication, and fo
cus. "Competing in a triathlon is
a humbling experience. You really
have to learn to respect your body
on the highest level," says
Haberstroh. "If you don't treat
your body right, it will refuse to
perform for you when you need it
to race, usually for over 6 hours.
There's a lot of give and take."
Such grueling competition re
quires a ton of training.
Haberstroh creates her own work¬

outs, which she says require a lot
of time and energy.
In the fall and spring, she
works mostly on her running. She
enjoys spending most of her time
running through the battlefields
with some tr_^ck and some hill
workouts interspersed. During the
winter months, Haberstroh uses a
windtrainer device which allows
her to ride her own bicycle as a sta
tionary unit indoors. Of the three
disciplines involved, Haberstroh
feels her swimming suffers most,
as she would rather dedicate most
of her time to running.

Haberstroh has learned a
great deal about herself and per
forming by competing in athletics,
triathlons in particular. Athletics
have taught Haberstroh discipline
and determination, as well as to
respect her body. Last spring,
Haberstroh trained really hard to
run a marathon. She was running
up to 55 miles per week and was
not paying enough attention to the
needs of her body.
On the day of the race, at the
17 mile mark, her knees gave out
on her and she was unable to con
tinue due to the extreme pain she
was experiencing in her legs which
would carry her no further. "I
learned to respect my limitations
that day, because I now have ma
jor knee injuries that I have to deal
with."

Shown here on her bike,
Kelly Haberstroh races
madly to the finish
line...Something she has
pone thirty times.

Haberstroh most recently
raced on Sunday, September 7, in
the Seven Presidents' Triathlon in
Long Branch, New Jersey. The
race, which was in the sprint dis
tance, had a field of approximately
100 women competing.
Haberslroh was in 7th place after
the half mile swim.
Then, like Speedy Gonzales,
she moved into second place after
biking for twenty miles. "They
hung me out to dry on the [five
mile] run," explains Haberstroh. "I
ended up in something like 13th
place overall." Without the offi
cial results, Haberstroh does not
know her official place overall.
She did, however, win the college
division of the race, finshing in
only one hour and twenty minutes.

Kelly Haberstroh is involved
in a number of other activities on
campus. The senior is an econom
ics and accounting double major,
who has high hopes of working for
a Big Six firm in Washington D.C.
Presently she is a teacher's assis
tant for the economics department,
where she teaches a
microeconomics lab. She is also
president of Omnicron Delta
Epsion, the Economics Honor So
ciety. In addition to all that,
Haberstroh is employed by cam
pus recreation and is a Big Broth
ers/Big Sisters volunteer.
Haberstroh is constantly supported
by her family in her triathlons. Her
mother, Diane, even created a spe
cial calendar for her which con
tains pictures of Haberstroh com
peting. Haberstroh is also faith
fully championed by her twin
brother Josh, her older brother Ja
son, and her dad, Gary.
Kelly Haberstroh is an ex
tremely dedicated athlete who has
a great deal of patience, courage
and mental stamina. We at the
Gettysburgian salute Haberstroh
and support her in all of her
triathlons. Way to go, Kelly!

Football drops hammer on Hampden-Sydney; win 33-7

JoshEyler Assistant Sports Editor

How did our football team
do this past weekend? To put it
quite bluntly, the Gettysburg Bul
lets kicked posterior, and took
names in a 33 to 7 victory over
Hampden-Sydney. Or to put it as
resident expert "Sweet Lou"
Lunardi does: "You know we blew
'em out cause I got to play."
The offense this week was a
machine. Our Bullets scored in
every quarter. Paul "2 Legit 2
Quit" Smith ran for 206 all pur
pose yards. Somewhere in that
total can be found a sparkling 37
yard touchdown run that left
Hampden-Sydney dumbfounded.
Matt Hel wig gathered 137 all pur
pose yards and scored twice, once
from 1 yard away and once from 5
yards. Derek "I'm just a boy from
da' hood" Reed scored his first col
legiate touchdown on a 2 yard run.
Said Reed: "I was gonna do a
dance, but I was too tired."

nor Gurski (8 tackles), they left
Hampden-Sydney crying for their
mammas. Jason "Mad-dog"
Osborn (6 tackles), "Mean" Gene
Kraus (9 tackles) and "Fightin"'
Joe Hodakowski (5 tackles)

of guys, however. The five guys
that protect "Tony the Hair"
Fugaro and keep Smith and

backfield, they played exception
ally well this last game. These are
the guys that are constantly being
hit and bruised and, at the same
time, are hitting and bruising back:
the offensive linemen. They never
get enough credit, so now it is time
they get a little "somethin'

Senate works?

Budget reduction leads to 20 percent budget cuts for Senate-sponsored student organizations

file photo
In 1994, Student Senate succeeded in getting the library to stay open 24 hours. Is the current budget situation preventing Senate from working?

by Ann Marie Bielli
Staffwriter

Due to a budget cut from the Office
of College Life, outstanding bills from last
year, and the formation of new organiza
tions, Gettysburg's Student Senate has had
to cut its own budget and those of various
organizations on campus by about 20%.
There are some discrepancies con
cerning the actual amount that was cut from
Senate's overall budget.
A memo issued at the first senate
meeting of the semester by Student Senate
Treasurer Sara Zalewski stated "when I re
ceived the budget for Student Senate this
year, I was aware that it had been cut by
about 5%."
But according to Julie Ramsey, Dean
of College Life, the actual amount that was

cut from the budget was one percent.
Zalewski's memo continued "There
were also outstanding bills I had to pay from
last year. After paying the bills, I began to
look at the allocations for the organizations.
Everyone was cut 20% of their last budget."
While the cuts have caused some com
motion, both Ramsey and Zalewski believe
these cuts may have actually done more
harm than good.
Traditionally, Student _Senate has been
given a budget of around $80,000 at the start
of the school year. This money is then allo
cated to sponsor various entertainment ac
tivities for the student body and also to fund
approximately 27 student-run organizations
on campus.
Each organization is allocated a cer
tain amount of money from the $80,000 to
help pay for their programming and activi¬

ties. If organizations find they need more
money, they are able to request this money
at Senate meetings and are usually granted
the amount asked for.
This system has worked fairly well for
a long time now, with one major flaw. Sen
ate usually does not use all the money in
their budget. This unused money, which
Dean Ramsey reported as being close to
$10,000 to $20,000 each year, is returned
to the College in may and placed in a "gen
eral college fund" to pay for extraneous
things such as utility bills for the school.
Dean Ramsey feels that such money
would be better spent on the students, for
whom the money was originally intended.
Ramsey emphasizes the fact that the budget
cut does not mean Student Senate cannot
do certain things. "There is no reason for a
good program to go to the wayside," she

said, "if more money is needed there is more
money available."
Ramsey believes that the situation has
"nothing to do with budget cuts, it has to do
with budget management." In the past,
money has been wasted by not being used
by the students and instead ending up in
"general college funds" to pay for bills.
Under this new system, student orga
nizations and Senate must now learn to be
better managers and to be accountable for
the money they spend.

Future looks bright to commission

Task force members optimistic about direction of College

by Rebecca M.Schantzenbach
staff writer

Nine different task forces,
composed of successful parents,
students, and alumni, were put to
gether to form Gettysburg's Com
mission on the Future.
The Commission was
formed by the College as part of a
plan to better prepare the students
of the next century. Members
meet to plan and discuss improve
ments that need to be made to the
College, as well a.s some improve
ments that have already been
made. The nine task forces are
as follows:

Collaborative Learning & Teamwork
Culture & the Arts
Economics &
Management Enhancing Residence
Life
Excellence in Science
and Technology
Public Affairs &
Public Service
Student Recruitment
& Retention
Supporting Student
Success.

Following the
Commission's luncheon last Sat
urday_.Sept. 20, several committee
members were asked to discuss
their role, and main objective for
the Commission. Most members
seemed positive an and optimis
tic about the future of Gettysburg.
Professor John Committo
and Kathy Falkenstein '72 were
on the Science & Psychology task
force. They both agreeed that the
sciences were strong at
Gettysburg, and both intended to
see that they are kept that way.
Jean Kirchoff '64 of the
Residence Life task force, and Bill
Kirchoff '63 of the Economics &
Management task force, both
agreeed that "There is more inter
action between students and fac
ulty than ever before."
Both felt that Gettysburg

can be a better place when stu
dents, faculty, and administration
are incorporated together more
closely.
Another alumnus returning
for the Commission was Greg
Islan '70, of the Information Tech
nology task force. The goal of this
group is to incorporate technology
into the curriculum.
He said "After 21 years, the
same issues are still coming up.
We need to find a way for the fac
ulty and students to use informa
tion technology most effectively."
John Cook '85, who served
on the Public Service task force,
was very impressed with the pub
lic service programs here on cam
pus. He spoke enthusiastically
about, recognizing its importance.
However, he sated that he would
like to see Gettysburg "expand the
awareness of publicaffairs on cam
pus." This would entail a focus on
civic responsibilities, voting, in
volvement, and other such areas.

Charles Black '60, of the
Economics & Management task
force, wants to see more global
ization of the Management and
Economics departments.
He stated that "it is impor
tant to realize that there are cul
tural differences all over the world.
It is necessary, especially for busi
ness majors, to know about these
differences and be aware of them."
„ One way in which he would
suggest promoting this would be
to have speakers come in from
companies that have experience
dealing with people with different
cultural backgrounds.
"It could also be beneficial
to listen to some professors and
students discuss the differences
they saw when they came here,"
he said.

These Committee members
all seemed optimistic about the
future of the College, and encour
aged the current state of the cam
pus environment.

about only five poets.
John Ashbery,

tinues to interest me
deeply, both intellectu
ally and formally, even

and inventive assess
ments of these fine poets'
work help us gain some
focus on the "uncertainty
and plenitude" of the
current poetry scene,

'Burgian finalist in Pacemaker

FromStaf fRepor ts
When the Gettysburgian
published its first issue on March
9,1897, one of the goals it set for
itself was "to place the name
Gettysburg second to none."
One hundred years later, the
student newspaper is fulfilling that
goal. The Gettysburgian was
named a finalist for the National
Pacemaker Award, an honor that
is often described as "the Pulitzer
of student journalism."
Although the Gettysburgian
has won numerous local and na
tional awards in its long history, it
has never won the coveted Pace
maker.
Only 40 student newspapers
from colleges and universities
across the United States were se
lected as finalists. Winners will be
announced at the Associated Col¬

legiate Press Conference in Chi
cago on November 1.
"It is a great honor to be fi
nalists for such a prestigious
award," said Editor-in-Chief,
Rebecca Babbitt. "And it's nice to
have our hard work appreciated,
not just on campus, but by students
and professionals all over
America."
The Associated Collegiate
Press began presenting ' the award
in 1925. The Newspaper Associa
tion of America Foundation and
the ACP have cosponsored the
Pacemaker competition since
1971. A panel of judges lead by
Margaret Holt from the Chicago
Tribune judged the competition.
Entries were judged on coverage
and content, quality of writing and
reporting, leadership on the opin
ion page, evidence of in-depth re
porting, design, photography, art
and graphics.

edgeable criticism can show us
ways to begin measuring the ac
complishments of our poetic age.
Stitt's interest in these
poets is intellectual and aesthetic.
He uses his understanding of the
philosophical implications inher
ent in modern physics, as they ap
ply to both content and form, as
the basis of his close analysis.
He attends to the poets'
writerly strategies so that we may
discover in their poetry where "sur
face form" intersects and comple
ments meaning and thus becomes,
in John Berryman's terms, "deep
form." He explains what these po
ets say and how they say it and
what relationships lie between. He
shows how humor plays a part in
some of their work.
Stitt's previous book of
poetry criticism was selected as
one of the Outstanding Academic
Books of the Year by Choice maga¬

. Donald Hall says, ""Peter
Stitt writes with a warm familiar
ity of poetry that he admires, and
he is also willing to make distinc
tions in the work of poets he on
the whole admires, and by his
negatives gives us some chance to

determine the justice of his gen
eral judgements."
In addition to editing the
Gettysburg Review, Peter Stitt is
professor of English at
Gettysburg College. In 1993 he
was chosen as the first recipient
of the PEN/Nora Magid Award
for excellence in editing. His
writings appear regularly in the
Paris Review, New York Times
Book Review, Georgia Review,
and many other publications.
Uncertainty and
Plentitude is currently available
in bookstores, or may be ordered

BUDGET

from p 1
Sara Zalewski also be
lieves the budget cuts are a good
learning experience. When asked
about how she felt about the cuts,
she responded by saying, "I was
disappointed but it is just one of
those things you have to deal
with. . , these budget puts ,are
teaching organizations how ' to_^e
more responsible with their
spending."
Senate has not had to cut
any activities that they usually
sponsor. They recently spon
sored the very successful Shrimp
Fest, and major events such as
the Snow Ball are still yet to

come. Senate is currently looking
into cosponsoring social events
with the Student Activities Coun
cil. By combining ' forces, Sara
believes that they can bring lo
geth'6r l 'their mo'ney and their
ideas to have larger, higher qual
ity social events.
Jen Miluk, president of
SAC, agrees. She said that SAC

is interested in increasing the num
ber of all-campus events, in order to
incorporate more groups.
She feels that with the social
scene rapidly changing on campus,
it is important to provide more op
tions to the student body.
Individual organizations on
campus funded by Senate have made
changes to adapt to the budget cuts.

... these budget
cuts are teaching
organizations how
to be more re
sponsible with
their spending."
Sara Zalewski
Bryan Roberts, treasurer of
the Gettysburg Environmental
Concerns Organization (GECO),
said the cuts were "kindof a shock,
but they were understandable."
GECO plans to make up the reduc¬ r _Y

tion in its budget through fund
raising activities. When asked if
the organization was going to have
to cut certain programs this year,
Roberts replied, "No, we are plan
ning more activities this year."
Jaime Foanio, treasurer of
Alpha Phi Omega, the coe.d service
fraternity on campus believed that
the cuts weren't that big of a prob
lem. Alpha J?hi Omega is
/ planning a _little differently
and watching their spending
closely.

that "We are all being com

best advice is to spend what you

Surfing the' Burg with CNAV

by Melodie Foster
Staff Writer
How do they do that? You
know, those people who knew
your phone number before you
did, the ones who seem to be
around every time you get out of
class, who know more about you
than you yourself do? How did
they get all this information?
Maybe they're working for the
FBI, maybe they're a spy, or
maybe they just logged on to
Gettysburg's new computer sys
tem, CNAV.
Affectionately know as
StalkerNet, the system allows stu
dents to search for people by
name, email address, interests, and
can match them up with classes,
clubs, and events compatible with
their interests.

Gettysburg's newest technological advancement proving itself useful to students and faculty

_oe useu
the inactivity and apathy that can
be found on campus.
The program allows students
to access a vast amount of informa
tion pertinent to them simply,
quickly and conveniently, in many
cases without ever leaving their
rooms. Sophomore Alex Caswell
had this to say about CNAV: "It's a
very handy tool to look up people's
phone numbers, see upcoming
events, explore aliases, and put
events on calendar."
Caswell has spent a lot of
time with the program, so knows
very well how it works. "I've
worked with it a lot, so it's handy. I
like the versatility of the program,
how you can customize it to your
personal preferences. You can find
out about everyone in your classes,
email them, and get their numbers.
The survey function is pretty cool,
too." com

Though new to most of the
student body this fall, CNAV, the
Curriculum Navigation Tool, has
been in the works for almost two
years. The development team,
headed by Mike Martys, set up
CNAV with the hopes of reducing
the effects of the common "stu
dents don't know what they don't
know" syndrome.
To silence the cries of "oh,
I wish I'd know about that two
years ago," and "well, I didn't
know that was this Tuesday," and
to bring students out of hiding by
presenting them with options
rather than making them search
for them.
CNAV works on a principle
of puzzle pieces, says Martys. It
takes all the information about
clubs, classes, activities, and
people on campus and, using these
bits of information it knows about
you (from your official records
and what you provide), arranges
the 'pieces' in a way that corre
sponds to what you would be most
interested in.

"We try to make good acci
dents happen," says CNAV team
member Don Redman.
Every student has a CNAV
account. First-year students au
tomatically have access, but up
perclassmen must sign up. This
can be done simply by emailing

cnav@gettysburg.edu with a
short note saying you would
like to access your CNAV ac
count. You will be emailed
back a temporary password that
will allow you to log-on for the
first time.
Some upperclassmen,
though, do know how to use
CNAV. Some learned last year.
This summer, the RAs, Orien¬

tation Lead
ers, and the
sports teams
all learned
to use the
system be
fore regis
tration.

The Cool Stuff page dis
plays a schedule of events occur

to the interests you have chosen
from the multitude supplied on

ings. CNAV also gives students
the ability to create special in¬

you have to do is get a name for
your group, add the email ad

By tilling out the Interests sec
tion in My Place, you can find other
people with similar interests. This
fulfills one of the goals of CNAV,
which is to help the campus commu
nity grow closer.
Out of 258 responses to a sur
vey posted on the program (yet an
other use of CNAV), less than twenty
people found any aspect of CNAV to
be completely negative. 197 of the

I responses were
very positive,
I saying that they
liked the concept
of CNAV "very
much." Over
200 of the re
sponses were
quite positive on
everything: the
student informa
tion, the search
engines, the sur
vey tool, the look
and the feel, and
the layout.
91 of the
I respondants think that the
people in charge
of CNAV should
focus on the stu
dent information
part of CNAV; 73
believe the focus
should be on the
surveys.
C o m -
plaints con
cerned issues
such as the limi
tations of the in
formation avail
able, the interest
lists and privacy.
This is the most
commonly heard
complaint; stu
dents fear com¬

plete strangers can discover too much
about them, even that the network aids
stalkers.
This may be true, but much of
the information now available on
CNAV was available on the gopher
system beforehand. There is also a

cumuai
system ol checks and balances built
into the program to ensure the se
curity of the information made
available. There are four types of
accounts: student, faculty, admin
istrator, and staff, each with its own
level of access.
With the exception of a pic
ture in your class rosters (where
people will see you anyway), no in
formation about you can be made
available about you if you do not
want it to be.
It is possible to keep almost
everything private, but this defeats
the purpose of the program, which
is supposed to link people, places
and events together by collecting
and matching information about
them. Overall, the addition of
CNAV to the campus computer sys
tem has been a successful endeavor.
The program has fallen remarkably

Big names shake up Cop Land

byJonFr oehlich
Staff Writer
"Half the men I watch live
across my line of jurisdiction,
where no one's watching." - Moe
Tilden Cop Lan, starring Sylvester
Stallone, is dramatic from start to
finish. With a cast boasting names
like Harvey Keitel, Robert DeNiro
and Ray Liotta, Cop Land brings
people to the theaters and really
delivers what they want.
Freddy Heflin, played ex
cellently by Sylvester Stallone
(Rocky, Cliffhangef) is a New Jer¬

sey sheriff who has fallen about
as low as he can go. Kept out off
the police force on account of be
ing legally deaf in one ear after
saving a young girl from drown
ing, Freddy has started to expect
as little of himself as everyone else
does. Because his jurisdiction is
Cop Land (Garrison, NJ), a town
occupied almost exclusively by
dirty NYPD cops, Freddy is con
stantly being told to turn his back
and to "just go home." Under
standably, Freddy's life has worn
him down into a shell of a man
who has seemingly stopped car
ing.

Stallone plays this role to
perfection (he even put on 40
pounds for it) and lets all that is

Freddy Heflin project out to audi
ences. Freddy is calm and seem
ingly too laid back on the outside,
but Stallone makes it easy for
viewers to sense the frustrations
that eventually lead to the climax
of Cop Land.
On the other side of the law
is Ray Donlan, played by Harvey
Keitel (Pulp Fiction, Smoke). As
the head of all crime in Garrison,
Donlan takes the form of a NYPD
officer and apparent orchestrator
of Cop Land. He sees Freddy the
way most people do, a pushover
who is nothing to worry about. It
is with this attitude that Donlan
runs Garrison as a nest of crime

for dirty NYPD and assumes the
law can't reach him from across
the George Washington bridge.
The plot of "Cop Land" ig
nites when police officer Murray
"Super-Boy" Babitch jumps sus
piciously to his supposed demise
after it becomes apparent that he
may be under investigation. Un
der heavy cover, Babitch is taken
to Garrison where he is to be killed
and prevented from talking, as was
planned out by Donlan, his uncle.
It is this scandalous event that
causes the world of the small town
sheriff and that of a mob-infested
group of cops to collide and meld
into a movie full of drama, sus¬

pense and raw acting power.
Through Stallone's por
trayal, audiences are able to see
and appreciate Freddy's transfor
mation from a small time nobody
to what he has alwayswanted to
be: a real cop with real power.
After it is clear that Babitch is
alive, Freddy, with a new-found
realization of who he has become
and who he wants to be, vows to
go after "Super-Boy" and bring all
the various evils of Cop Land to
justice.
Though this theme may
seem like one synonymous with
the name Stallone, viewers get just
what they don't expect. We see in
Cop Land a different kind of re
venge-bent Stallone from what
we've become accustomed to in
movies such as Rambo and Co
bra. The rough edges that have
often stereotyped former Stallone
movies have been filed away in
Cop Land to reveal a truly tal
ented and composed actor.

Along with Stallone, other
good performances accentuate the
brilliant plot of Cop Land. Most
notable of these were those of
Robert DeNiro (Heat, Sleepers) as
Internal Affairs officer Moe
Tilden, and Ray Liotta (No Es
cape) as Freddy's apparent best
friend and fellow cop.

Though many of the events
of Cop Land involving the mob,
murder, scandal, justice, dirty
cops, clean cops and personal duty
are difficult ones, this movie
handles them well. With an ex
plosive scene near the end, in
which Director James Mangold

(who comes up big with this, only
his second movie) chooses to
simulate Freddy's near deafness
by turning the sound down to a
minimum, Cop Land turns out to
be a fantastically made movie with
a satisfying conclusion and a cast
to match.

The Craft

by Glen Beck
StaffWriter Imagine a movie that com
bines the sophistication and magic
of the Witches of Eastwick with
the teen appeal of Clueless. The
product of that merge would be
director Andrew Flemming's The
Craft. Now, I may have exagger
ated this comparison, but the film
is a sure draw for the college and
high school crowd. Many viewers
will recognize the actresses: Robin
Tunney (Empire Records) as Sa
rah, FairuzaBalk (The Island of Dr
Moreau, Return to Oz) as Nancy,
Neve Campbell (Scream) as
Bonnie, and Rachel True (No
where) as Rochelle.
Some people might sympa
thize with the theme and situation
of the film. The story unfolds as
the new kid in town, Sarah, finds
herself a misfit at her new high
school. After facing the jerk of the
school who recently spread rumors

In Case You Missed It...

about a nonsexual encounter, Sa
rah falls into a group of three other
social outcasts who dabble in the
occult.
When these four girls join up
together, they achieve unstoppable
power. Anything they want can be
accomplished, from snagging the
boy of their dreams to humiliating
the school's token stuck-up snob.
However, as with any
"ideal" situation, problems arise
and, as with any good movie, a
fight ensues (The Craft did win
the 1997 MTV Movie Award for
Best Fight Scene).
I won't give away who
emerges victorious. I will men
tion, though, that anyone who has
a fear of bugs or snakes might want
to refrain from watching the end
scene of the movie.
The film requires a "willing
suspension of disbelief' (a theater
term which implies that the viewer
must put aside some conventions

of reality and delve into the world
of the film or play) on the part of
the audience at a couple of points.
The four actresses playing
the leads look more college age
than high school. And, according
to a friend, some of the witchcraft
is highly exaggerated. However,
there are instances where the ac
tors enact the rituals correctly.
In any case, the film uses
some spectacular visual effects. In
one scene in particular, the cinema
tographer achieves a highly dra
matic shot where a mirror reflects
the opposite image of what should
be seen—very eerie.
Various tight shots express
the idea of being trapped, and
close-ups allow for expressive
moments.
All-in-all, the film offers
thrills, chills, and laughs. Go rent
the video and watch it with a
couple of friends. But watch out
for those snakes.

Coral reefs find anemone in man

byStephanieBusch
GECO Columnist
Coral reefs, which are found
in 109 countries throughout the
world, are in great danger. Mosl
have been damaged or completely
destroyed by human activity.
There are two major areas
of coral reefs in the world: the
Indo-Pacific region, which
stretches from southeast Asia
through Polynesia and Australia
eastward across the Indian Ocean
to Africa; and the Western Atlan
tic region, which stretches from
Florida to Brazil and the Red Sea,
located between Africa and Saudia
Arabia.
Two of the more popular
reef spots in the world are the
Great Barrier Reef near Australia,
and those in the Carnbean.

There are many threats to
the coral reefs, but the most dam
aging are sedimentation, human
run-off, fishing with explosives,
cyanide fishing, careless recre
ation, and global warming.
Sedimentation is the effect
when soil erosion occurs from log
ging, fanning, mining or inshore
construction, and the soil runs
downstream into the ocean. The
dirt, silt, or sand causes the water
to become turbid, cloudy and
muddy, which in turn prevents
sunlight from reaching the coral.

Without light, the coral reefs can
not survive.
Human run-off is caused by
the dumping of fertilizers and sew
age into the coastal waters. This
waste causes algae to rapidly pro
duce and use up a great deal of the
oxygen, as well as block the sun
light from reaching the coral, con
sequently chocking the reefs.
Fishing with explosives and
cyanide are also extremely detri
mental to the reefs. Fishing with
explosives is when fisherpeople
prepare bombs, place them in or
near the coral reef areas and when
the bombs explode it kills the fish.
These fish are then harvested, and
the reefs are to destroyed to a fine
crumble.
The cyanide fishing is when
commercial fishing fleets use cya
nide or other chemicals to capture
the fish by stunning them so that
the fish are still are alive when
they are sold. These poisons de
stroy the reefs as well as the other
creatures which live among the
reefs.

Recreation such as boating,
diving, and fishing can also be a
large contributor to destroying the
reefs, if not done carefully.
While vacationing, many
people take the chance and snor
kel, scuba dive, or just swim
around coral reefs. These beauti
ful natural wonders are huge tour¬

ist attractions in many popular va
cation spots.
Global warming is a tre
mendous threat to coral reefs be
cause not only does warming in
crease the water temperature,
which "bleaches" the reefs, but
heavy storm activity, which often
occurs due to global warming, can
also have an ill effect on the reefs
and their inhabitants.
When the ocean water be
comes too warm, the "coral pol
yps lose the symbiotic algae in
side of them causing the reefs to
turn white or "bleached' and even
tually die," according to the Coral
Reef Alliance.
Coral reefs are extremely
important because they provide
habitats for more than 25% of the
ocean's species. Coral reefs serve
many purposes in the maintaining
of marine life, such as a provider
of food, shelter, and protection to
various marine species, as well as
a nursery to growing fish, and
much more.

Roosters to crow
in Kline

by Ashley Br own
Contributing Writer
The Owl and Nightingale
Players are proud to present this
fall's main stage production of
Milcha Sanchez-Scott's Roosters
. This fiery and humorous drama
illustrates contemporary domes
tic life in the American South¬

west. Roosters, directed by Pro
fessor George Muschamp, set de
sign by Professor Jerome O.
Hanson, and choreographed by
Paula Kellinger, is geared to cap
tivate audiences with its sense of
"magical realism."
Performances will be held
in Kline Theater of Brua Hall at
8 o'clock on October 2, 3, 4, 6,
and 7. There will also be a mati
nee performance at 2 p.m. on
Sunday, October 5. Free tickets
may be obtained for Friday and
Saturday's shows beginning Sep
tember 25 in the Theater Office
at x6064.
Roosters is a story of love,
power, dreams, and delusions in
a Latino-American family. The
setting: a simple, pueblo-style
home in the American Southwest.
The family: a complexly diverse
group of confused individuals
searching for answers in a world
where help is unobtainable.

Legendary breeder of fight
ing cocks Gallo Morales (Robert
Thompson) returns home after
seven years in jail for manslaugh
ter. On the day of his return, his
20 year old son Hector (Dave
Shoffner) decides to fight a prize
bird inherited from his grandfa¬

ther (Jeremy Katz), and then ei
ther "eat it or sell it" for enough
money to get out of the valley.
The play centers on the
battle of supremacy between fa
ther and son. Drawn into the dis
pute are Hector's innocent sister
Angela (Jennifer MacMurtrie), his
lusty aunt Chata (Megan
Manthey), and his martyred
mother Juana (Samantha Gregg),
who only wants her family to live
in peace.
Rounding out the cast are
Paul Lapato as Adan, James Kohn,

Jeffrey Jones, Mary Cordero, and
Mike Ferrer as Shadows, Alec
Beekmans as Zapata, and Phil
Anderson as San Juan.
This slice of life, an explo
sive drama, attempts to answer
some of life's biggest mysteries
regarding power and survival.
Roosters asks whether any of us
can ever escape the fear of grow
ing up. The play also probes the
issues of forbidden lusts and pas
sions, such as gambling, and how
these passions are bound up in the
human experiences of family and
sexuality.

The production staff in
cludes Glen Beck as assistant di
rector, Zachary Alderfer as prop
manager, Duncan Niederer as
stage manager, Ashley Brown as
publicity, Tim Johnsen as the pro
duction coordinator/sound engi
neer, Jody Robertson as the stu

Documentary quilts together
woman's life experiences

Lunch Theater

by Justin Ether edge
Staff Writer
Professor Lynn _Hanley has
uncovered a rare and remarkable
jewel. With her documentary,
Penny Sisto: Fiber Artist, she has
done more than simply profile an
unusual artist, she has introduced
us to an extraordinary soul.
The subject of Professor
Hanley's first film project was
once an artist-in-residence here
nearly a decade ago. It didn't take
long, however, for Hanley to re
alize that Sisto was far more than
just an artist. And within the first
few minutes of the film, you find
out exactly what kind of lady she
really is.
First and foremost, Penny
Sisto is a storyteller. With a win
some Scottish accent and a

breezy, carefree manner, she re
calls with vivid accuracy tales of
her childhood, her extensive trav
els, and the history of her quilts.
She is brutally honest and open,
and seems just out of touch with
reality, which only makes her all
the more endearing.
But her stories cover the
gamut of emotions, often simul
taneously combining profound
sadness with a sobering humor.
In one of her most harrowing sto
ries, she tells with unflinching
realism of her days as a midwife
for an African tribe whose
women's vaginas had been gro¬

tesquely disligured in ritualized
circumcisions.
Sisto, who by her own ad
mission drops babies like flies,
also recollects squirting a
tribeswoman in the face with the
milk from her breast soon after
one of her own pregnancies, as if
that was the most natural thing in
the world to do.
Within each of her quilts lies
extensive stories, as well, both in

First and
foremost,

teller."
the fabric and in the content of the
piece. She receives fabrics from
all over the world, from African
dresses to Indian silks to cuts of
Japanese wedding veils.
She is incredibly politically
minded, and one of her favorite
quilts features the image of Anita
Hill, crucified, hands impaled by
erect penises. That piece, at least
by the end of the filming, was still
unsold.
She has never had profes¬

sional training and works strictly
from memory. The most remark
able feature of her quilts may be,
however, the faces of the subjects.
She has an unusual sense of the
human essence that she manages
to capture in (he eyes of her work.
They truly are beautiful, but all the
more astonishing is that she
doesn't seem to have any real un
derstanding of what she creates.
Professor Hanley's project,
funded by a grant from Gettysburg
College, took a vision over two
years in the making and helped
turn it into a reality.
With her daughter Jasmine
to assist her with sound and cam
era work, Professor Hanley visited
Sisto this summer at her home
outside of Louisville, Kentucky.
Filming took less than a week, and
while the editing took much
longer, there is still a bit of sound
work to be done.
Nevertheless, Professor
Hanley is optimistic about the
commercial value of her docu¬

mentary.
Once all the sound problems
are resolved, she plans on send
ing copies to distributors in New
York City who specialize in films
both produced by and featuring
women. Also look for a copy
which soon will be made available
in the Musselman Library.

Dear Casey..

Dear Casey,
I have been dating this guy
for two weeks, and we have be
come r eally close. I want to
spend all my time with him but
my friends just don't seem to
understand. I feel that is impor
tant to spend my time with him;
after all, he is my boyfriend. My
friends tell me I don't spend
enough time with them. I think
they ar e just jealous because I
haveagr eat boyfriend and they
don't What do you think?
Thanks,
Lost in Love
Dear Lost in Love,
I think you need to get your
new man to drive you to Wal-Mart
so you can buy yourself a clue.
Don't procrastinate; I think they're
having a discount!
There a couple of things you
need to realize. First, unfortu
nately, the world is not centered
around you and not everyone
thinks you are God's gift to the
universe, even if you do.

velop between you and your
friends. They arc most likely the
ones who are going to pick up the
pieces when things fall apart.
There's a saying that men
come and go, but your friends stay
with you through thick and thin.
Your boyfriend may be Mr. Right
for now, but in a month he could
be Mr. Wrong.
In the long run, two weeks
is not a long time, and it usually
takes much longer to form deep
bonds. If I were you, I would
watch your step and not go diving
into the pool of love, because you
might find it is a puddle.
Dear Casey,
Itseemsthatallther eisto
do on campus is drink, and even
then, most of the parties seem

parlies have now been condensed
into dorm rooms, where the main
activity is drinking. This cannot
only often get boring, but can of
ten become dangerous.
I admire your strength in not
wanting to bend your belief sys
tem, even in the most pressured of
all drinking scenes, college. It
seems that more and more people
are taking a stand against the dan
gers of "binge drinking." Did you
know that one person every seven
minutes dies from an alcohol re
lated death?
So you might think that
there is nothing else to do on cam
pus except to drink. My best ad
vice is to get involved with clubs
and activities. Through this you
will be able to meet people who
perhaps have similar interests as
you do.

to be in dorm r ooms. I don't
drink, and am finding it hard to
socialize and meet people.
Thereis nothing to do, andlam
starting to get bor ed. Any ad
vice? Thanks,
Dry and Bor ed
Dear Dry and Bored,
It does seem that in this day
and age, alcohol is the lubricant
to almost all socialization. I can
not count how many of my friends
have met their significant others
when either one or the other of
them was drunk. It is a sad, but
true. Of course, their ever-so-fond
memories of their first meeting are
often blurry and sometimes non
existent.
Also, it seems that many

There are also many school
sponsored events on the weekends
that are a lot of fun, and totally dry.
Try going to the Coffeehouse, start
dancing, and you're bound to meet
a lot of cool people.
It is all right to go to parties
and actually not drink. Some
people tend to think there are ta
boos attached to sober people at
parties, but I guarantee that you
can have a blast at a party without -
drinking, and not feel sick in the
morning. Besides, somebody has
to take care of all those drunk
people.
Do you have a question for
Casey ? Write to Box 434 or e-mail
her at s359658@gettysbiurg.edu"

Just because you have a
great boyfriend does not make you
a better person. You should not
mold your individuality around
another person, or even base your
status upon him. Even in this su
perficial world and society, what
matters most is who you really are,
not who you are dating.
You may not realize this
now, but you are burning bridges
between friends that you may not
be able to rebuild. It would most
likely be in your best interest not
to allow such a large gap to de-

Conflict and Consensus

From the Donkey's The Pachyderm's Pulpit: First

Mouth: What's in a Lady isn't very lady like

name ?

by AndyZysk
Contributing Writer
"It's those liberals down in
Washington!...It's the liberals'
fault!" How many times have we
all heard these accusations, con
stantly thrown about by such po
litical figures as Rush Limbaugh
and Newt Gingrich? If we were
to actually believe all of these
statements, it would probably
seem that everything was the fault
of "those liberals." It almost seems
as if conservatives hide behind
these accusations in order to avoid
actual discussions of the issues.
Nowadays, it is a common re
sponse of many conservatives and
Republicans to say to a person,
"Oh, you're such a bleeding-heart
liberal!", when they are confronted
with ideas which actually portray
a humanistic side. What, however,
is in a name?

According to Webster's Dic
tionary of the English Language,
a liberal is an individual charac
terized by "a general enlarging of
the mind beyond the merely
professional...not subject to the
common prejudices or conven
tions" and is "in favor of individual
liberty and social reform." If you
ask me, this supposed insult really
doesn't hold up to close inspection.
In a world that is constantly chang
ing along national and interna
tional lines, those with the title
"liberal" will fair much better than
those with the name "conserva
tive." For can we really continue
to hold onto all of the beliefs of
the past like a security blanket
when confronted with a changing
global environment? I am not say
ing that it is necessary to totally
disregard the wisdom of our fore
fathers in the political and religious
realm

Unlike the conservative,
though, the liberal is willing to re
view the beliefs of the past for their
continued validity no matter what
the outcome. The liberal asks,
'Are there new ways to approach
this issue?" Throughout the devel¬

opment of humankind, an expand
ing and open mind has been a ne
cessity. What i f no one dared ques
tion the racial policies of the 60's
or attempted to see the potential
economic role of the nation's gov
ernment during the Great Depres
sion? For the benefit of all the
people who live within our
country's borders, we should at all
times attempt to see every side of
an issue and be willing to push the
limits toward a positive goal.
In the past year or so, Demo
crats across the nation have been
labeled as "bleeding-heart liber¬

als" for their earlier opposition to
dramatic changes in the national
welfare system. Due to President
Clinton's intervention, a bill was
recently passed which was a great
deal less harsh as originally
planned by Congressional Repub
licans. The Administration contin
ues to attempt to make changes in
order to guarantee benefits for the
children of legal immigrants. Con
servatives also like to label envi
ronmentalists as bleeding-heart
liberals for their continued struggle
to oppose policies which destroy
the environment in the best inter¬

ests of industry.
Why do I bring up these two
recent examples to prove my
point? I raise these issues to dem
onstrate the irony and stupidity of
such "insults." The majority of
conservatives would like to pre
tend that nothing is wrong with the
environment. They can be pre
sented with an abundance of evi
dence from scientists around the
globe that attests to such problems
as global warming and deforesta
tion. Yet all they can do, with the
backing of a few other minimal
studies, is stick to their contention
that nothing is wrong. When con
fronted with verified statistics
which state that many people, es
pecially children, due to extreme
changes in the welfare system,
could be left on the street when the

Staff Writer It may be just me, but it
seems that First Lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton has disappeared.
We recently saw Mrs. Clinton at
the funeral for the Princesses of
Whales, Diana, but for the most
part, Mrs. Clinton has remained in
exile, an exile that was forced by
the voters in the Republican land
slide of 1994. Not only was elec
tion night 1994 a rebuke of Presi
dent Clinton but was an attack
upon the First Lady herself.
The President and Mrs.
Clinton have always been a team,
that has helped and hurt each of
them. Both are intelligent, ambi
tious people who have worked on
accomplishing a set of goals which
reached their pinnacle with the
President's reelection last year.
However, it was the same Hillary
Rodham Clinton who had to be put
aside for the 1996 Clinton-Gore
campaign.

What I expected did not oc
cur, now that Bill Clinton does not
have to worry about elections or
campaigning, it was my belief that
Mrs. Clinton would take front and
center again. Instead she has
stayed in the shadows picking and
choosing when to stand out. The
Hillary Clinton (Excuse me,
Hillary Rodham Clinton) of today
is like the Hillary Clinton of the
eighties. After Bill Clinton was
elected the youngest governor in
the nation in 1978, in Arkansas, his
wife played a large public and pri
vate role. She did not take his name
and remained simply Hillary
Rodham. That did not play well
in conservative Arkansas. In 1980
because of the Governor's liberal
agenda, lack of leadership, and,
yes, in part liberal wife, Bill
Clinton became the nation's
youngest unemployed governor.

No one has ever been able
to keep Bill Clinton down and in
1982 with his wife's help, he came
back. The former Governor apolo
gized to the voters, promised to
govern from the middle, and
Hillary Rodham added the name
Clinton. He won and the Illinois
native who was now Arkansas's

First Lady worked on helping the
plight of children, a popular cause,
through the Children's Defense
Fund. At the same time, she built
a reputation as one of the best law
yers in the nation with the Rose
Law Firm.
Despite what is reported to
have been bitter marital problems
the Clinton's remained together,
raised their daughter and hit the
campaign trail for the White
House. During the 1992 cam
paign, Mrs. Clinton became an is
sue when she insulted housewives
when she said that she did not want
to stay home and bake cookies but

to get out and do something with
her life.
Both of the Clintons caught
fire when Candidate Bill Clinton
saidby electing him, you "are get
ting two for the price of one with
Hillary." Mrs. Clinton's writings
from college on, where she met her
future husband and President, were
slammed. Her comparisons of
marriage to slavery was hit hard,
and her financial dealings were
under scrutiny by Mr. Clinton's
opponent, former California Gov
ernor Jerry Brown. She would be
attacked at the '92 Republican
National Convention by the Party's
Chairmen Rich Bond and Pat

Buchanan. It was clear in 1992
that this former Young Republican
had become a lightning rod.
Team Clinton won, and the
old Hillary was back. Unlike ev
ery other First Lady, Mrs. Clinton
moved her office from the White
House East Wing to the President's
West Wing. She wanted to be
closer to the power center, and she
clearly was with the announcement
that she would head up the Com
mission on National Health-career
Reform. When the plan was in
troduced, it was clear that the First
Lady was one of the President's
most liberal advisors. The plan
rationed care, took away choice,
and let government takeover one
sixth of the American economy.
Republicans for food reasons ar
dently opposed the plan, and
Democrats ran away from it to save
their political lives. When Mrs.
Clinton by bus traveled the coun
try to rally support for "Socialized

Medicine" the public greeted her
with protest from Seattle to Balti
more. In the end the Administra
tion could not even get the Con
gress to even vote on it.
It was not that the American
people did not just dislike the plan,
the disliked the idea of a co-Presi
dency. Bill, not Hillary Clinton,
had to face the voters. Strong First
Ladies have always been attacked
throughout, not every First spouse
can be a Barbara Bush, perhaps the
most popular woman in America.
Unlike, Hillary Clinton though,
most First Ladies do not come
close if not break the law.
Now at the center of national
attention, Hillary's dark side began
to appear. With the breaking of
Whitewater scandal, the nation
saw how Mrs. Clinton got rich by
skirting with the law.

Journalist James Stewart's
book Blood Sport gave a devastat
ing account of Mrs. Clinton's eth
ics and her trouble telling truth, a
problem that seems to run in the
Clinton family. New York Times
columnist Bill Safire even called
her a, "Congenital liar." Stories of
shredded documents, big money,
and lies associated with Hillary
Rodham Clinton were ironic con
sidering a much younger Hillary
worked to impeach President
Nixon in 1974 over the Watergate
Scandal.

New scandals arose over
Mrs. Clinton's role in the
Travelgate Scandal, for which she
was perhaps the central figure. The
story was basically that the long
time White House Travel Office
was fired and replaced withfriends
of the First Family. The FBI was
abused to attack the head of the
Travel Office. In virtually every
White House scandal, the First
Lady was forced to appear before
a Grand Jury to answer questions
about missing documents appear
ing in the White House's private
quarters.

The people around Mrs.
Clinton have not fared will in the
national spotlight. Her Chief of

nual all campus formal is an ex
cellent event, but it could be just
as much fun without hiring some
one to tell them where the balloons
should go.
The budget cut is under
standable; the fact that Senate
passed that cut on to organizations
rather than tightening their own
belt is not.
Senate works, but it could
work more efficiently.
We are fortunate to attend a
private college where there is of
ten enough money to go around,
but thousands of college students
do not enjoy many of the extrava
gances that we have available to
us. We could learn a lesson from
schools where money is not always
taken for granted.

Everyone in every organiza
tion should be mindful of how their
money is spent. After all, it is the
tuition money that we are all pay
ing; money that we and our par
ents have worked hard for and that
should not be squandered mind
lessly. Student organizations that
use their money for worthwhile
causes should not be punished by
Senate.
Student Senate should re
evaluate its budget more seriously
and cut the unnecessary perks and
extras that cost us so much.

us...
Consider this....

"Senate works" has been the
theme of Student Senate for sev
eral years. And over the years Sen
ate has made some positive
changes on campus. The round the
clock service at the library is prob
ably their most famous improve
ment. But how well does Senate
work? Senate's budget for the
1997-98 school year was reduced.
But rather than suck up the differ
ence, Senators passed most of the
the cut on to the many student or
ganizations they support finan
cially. These organizations will feel
the pinch. In some cases they will
be working with budgets under
$ 1,000 for the year. These groups
provide valuable campus pro
gramming and offer a plethora of
opportunities to their students.
Money well spent.

Senate, on the other hand,
uses part of its budget for perks
such as name plates, banners, and
special scholarships open only to
Senators.
Senate also spends money
on projects where they could eas
ily find ways to cut costs.
For example, in the past,
Senate has hired a professional
decorator to transform the ball
room for the Snowball. The an-

Staff Writer
I would like to provide a
brief response to one of the letters
rebutting my last column, pertain
ing to the "Red Zone" before I con
tinue with this essay. It appears
that there may have been a misrep
resentation of my words. If so, I
don't understand because I usually
try to be quite honest and frank
with my language and opinions. I
commend the work of the
Women's Center and other orga
nizations for trying very hard to
end this issue, but my primary
complaint is purely societal, for

which little can be done without a
drastic reversal. If one looks
closely at the title of this column
it is called "This Side of Cynicism"
not "This Side of Solutions". I
suppose that I could think of some
harebrained scheme to change our
culture, but it would be terribly
idealistic and would trivialize the
issue. So then, I view the job of
the press to raise issues (which I
have) and communicate a certain
opinion concerning those issues
(which I did), so that they can be
debated. Simply, by raising a con
cern, one is taking a step toward a
solution to that concern. Mr.

Hirsch, whose assault was appre
ciated, has "no need" for my col
umn, but such a column has caused
him and others to write in offering
solutions and practical advice
about the issue. Thus the pen be
comes a chief instigator of change,
as per history, and is serving its due
purpose for action.
It seems as though the new
concern, which dominated these
pages last week, was the need for
more student involvement in ac
tivities. I believe that involved stu
dents are a very positive attribute

to college life, but we need to be a
bit careful where involvement is
directed on our campus. We must
remember that such involvement
has created a strong, yet gridlocked
bureaucracy, in which most issues
are not adequately addressed or
never brought up to the adminis
tration for debate. We see many
organizations on campus, all with
specific duties and roles, but sel
dom do we see any concrete pro
posals or actions directed toward
the administrative policies with
which we see problems. Now, be
fore you take out your pen and at¬

tack me, realize that I am not
speaking of all organizations, just
those which deal with student is
sues on campus. Call such orga
nizations "Student Leadership" or
"Student Concern" or whatever
you want. It is not necessarily the
fault of those organizations, for
they are only as strong as the stu
dents who use them. My com
plaint is two pronged: first towards
the student body and second to
wards the administration and bu
reaucracy.
Most of the time in college
life the same people serve in lead
ership positions across campus.
Thus we see the same exact people
bearing the burden of involvement
in multiple organizations and com
mittees. We need a more diverse
group of people involved and not
the same people dictating student
policy. Rather than having more
students involved, we need more

diverse students involved. Not
everyone on campus has the time
or the will for involvement in lead
ership. Some people are not prone
to holding positions and others just
hate meetings or are timid in so
cial situations. There is nothing
wrong with such behavior, but we
need not all feel a certain obliga
tion for involvement. Most of
those who are not involved do not
wish to be and could probably care
less, but there are some who do
wish but do not have the opportu
nity. A more diverse student fo
rum for ideas is what is needed.
The organizations which represent
student interests on campus need
to focus a good bit of time to con¬

structive criticism and open debate
over new ideas. Historically, col
leges and universities have been
forums of intellectual debate con
cerning societal or political issues.
Thus, Gettysburg needs to accom
modate such debates and encour
age the spread of diverse thought.
How does the college go about
doing that? Well, if I knew I would
write some legislation or plan a
forum. I suppose the issue of stu
dent involvement is as old as col
leges, but that doesn't mean we can
not work out something to cure the
apathy plague. The people need
to present a voice, and if that voice
is not possible, then what is the
point of student leadership? To
whom are our class officers and
senators representing if not the
people? The student body and

their organizations are useless un
less the administration utilizes their
input and respects their views when
policy is discussed. We have a
plethora of committees, but what
really comes out of such routine
meetings? Maybe (if we are lucky)
a new recycling bin, or in extreme
cases, a new committee is formed
to address the problems of the pre
vious committee. Thus Gettysburg
has formed over the years a very
long bureaucracy which would
make Imperial Russia green with
envy. If a student organization
would propose a policy reform,
what chance would their be of that

policy being accepted? It would
be reviewed and then probably shot
down a year after it was proposed.
For example, last year we had a
long debate over communication
between administrators and stu
dents. What did we see from such
a debate? A few sessions at the
Junction and suggestions at town
meetings which were not taken
very seriously. Is communication
any better now than it was last
year? The answer to my question
might be: "We formed a commit
tee to investigate these issues."
Thus the bureaucracy is expanded
and I am exhausted.

This is an issue for which I
do (for once) have a few construc
tive solutions. Students need to be
aware of the issues concerning their
campus and voice their opinions
accordingly within the student
body. We have all elected officials
whose primary concern is student
welfare and such official need to
be utilized. Seek out your sena
tors, class officers, or organization
leaders. Voice your concerns to
such officials. Come to senate
meetings or talk to a committee
chairperson and let your voice be
known. If you have an interest,

then follow such an interest and
seek out a student organization
which such an interest fits. By do
ing so, we can utilize the existing
student organizations, while be
coming more involved, to accom
modate change, if we utilize the
avenues we have, then their effi
ciency will be demonstrated so that
we do not need multiple investiga
tive committees, or the rest of the
red tape in which we are so deeply
entrenched. We need to show our
concerns and the responsibility to
act according to those concerns so
that something constructive can
actually be done.

A democrat is a
democrat is a
democrat

economy hits a recessional cycle,
many conservatives just refuse to
discuss that side of the issue and
stick to the issue of welfare abuse.
Well, excuse me for being a bleed
ing-heart liberal, but shouldn't
policymakers and voters have an
open mind to issues such as the
aforementioned ones? If being a
bleeding-heart liberal means car
ing about the environment around
me or caring about the nutritional
and material needs of a poor child,
please continue to label me with
this accusation.
What exactly is a "bleeding
heart liberal" anyway? The term
denotes someone who obviously
has too much sympathy for another
human being. Now, let me get this
straight: this is a bad thing? If so,
I worry about the future of our so
ciety. With regards to those who
label us pejoratively, "bleeding
hearts", I know that the conserva
tive Christian Coalition would
have us believe that Jesus would
also be a conservative. In all seri-

continued from page 12

think the Jesus of the Bible would
say to a hungry child or a destitute
mother? Get off your butt and get
a job? I think not.
In conclusion, I hope we all
someday carry the label "liberal."
We need to have an open mind
to ponder the serious questions that
confront our society in the present
day and age. Hopefully, unlike the
conservatives who simply quote an
accepted party line, (i.e. "Reagan's
economic policies had nothing to
do with the debt of the 80's), vot¬

ers and policymakers will view is
sues from every angle. In a 1939
radio address, President Franklin
D. Roosevelt made the following
quote: "A radical is a man with
both feet firmly planted - in the air;
a conservative is a man with two
perfectly good legs who, however,
has never learned to walk
forward;...a liberal is aman who
uses his legs and his hands at the
behest - at the command - of his
head." So next time someone ac
cuses you of being a "bleeding
heart liberal, say "thank-you."

ousness, though, whether you are
a Christian or not, what do you

Bullets Bucked
by Bison, 17-7

from Staff Reports
Rugby. Many people look
at this sport as a way of making
oneself dumber. A bunch of beer
drinking meatheads running
around chasing a football that was
inflated too much. This is a com
mon misconception of these grid
iron warriors. They fight hard,
play dirty, and don't complain
about twised ankles.
The men's rugby team
kicked off their fall season this
weekend against Bucknell. In the
first half, Gettysburg busted loose
on a quick try by rookie fullback
Shaw Talley. " Shaw played well
for his first game," said Senior
Center Matt Eisenberg, "The team,
in general, looks to have enough
talent for a prosperous season."
After the Bullets "Tally - d"
their first try, they continued to
dominate the trenches. The Bul
lets won almost every scrumdown,
and Hooker Jaime Schmoyer,
booted all the balls back to scrum
half Steve Acuri.

Arcuri was another battler
for the Bullets, and ran wild on the
tricky Bison. Although he ended
up a bit bruised Acuri was
definitley a force for this "never
say die," squad.
In the second half, the Bison
backfield finessed the ball up and
down the field and confused many
of the new starters for the Bullets.

The Bison took control of the field
with their "scissor" play, and took
advantage of the less experienced
Bullets.
The Bullets could not pre
vent Bucknell from scoring twice
in the second half and the match
ended 17-7.
"There are some things that
we still may need to improve on,"
emphasized Eisenberg, "like con
ditioning, and ball control." So, as
the Bullets prepare for some wind
sprints and the ever popular "Four
Corners, " drill, the rest of the
teams on the Bullets schedule had
better beware. With the expert
coaching of Kirby Smith, and the
leadership of Acuri and Eisenberg,
there is definite reason for the foes
of these Bullets to beware.

Bullets squash the "Melon" and win 6-3

Fiom staff reports ,
On Sunday, September
14, the women's tennis team
started their fall season on the right
foot. The Lady Bullets hosted
Carnegie Melon and defeated them
with a team score of 6-3. Two first
year students, Masako Yoshida and
Kay Cofrancesco, both had wins
at numbers one and six, respec
tively. Yoshida smoked Carrie
Mills 7-6(7-5), 6-3, who has been
a finalist in the National Rolex

Tournament for the last two years
and was ranked number three
among Division III. Cofrancesco,
at number six, defeated Whitney
Brooks 6-3, 6-0 in her first colle
giate match.
Also winning for the
Bullets were junior Lesley Kunzier
(#3) and Bev-Freda Jackson (#4).
Tara Schmilt (#2) and Kate
Goodall (#5) were both defeated
by Carnegie Melon opponents
Elizabeth Brown and Julie Balch.
Coach Pfitzinger emphasized the
wins that Gettysburg obtained at

numbers two and three doubles
were ver important to the team's
success. Kunzier and
Cofrancesco, playing at number
two, defeated Watkins and Tuxen

in a tough match with a final score
of 9-7. Also with the same tough
score was the number three team
of Goodall and Jackson, who de
feated Colcha and Cheu. Both of
these matches were very important

for the team to obtain their overall
win. The Lady Bullets will con
tinue to have practice this fall un
til mid-October, and their regulai
season will resume again in the
spring.


Bullets sink "Sho'emen's" shin , roll 5-0

by Marty "Moose" Masar
Contributing writer
The men's soccer team
improved their overall record to 4
3-0 with an impressive 5-0 win
over Washington College last Sat
urday. The team was lead by se
nior captain Greg Stevcic and
sophomore Chris Pryor. Both
players set school records in this
game. On his way to being
named to the Centennial Confer
ence Honor Roll, Stevcic scored
twice, and had two assists to the
lead the scoring for the Bullets.
Greg, who already has the record
for most career goals (37 and
counting), can now add the mosl
career assists in Gettysburg soccer
history to his resume (23) as well.
He broke Scott Stoddard's ('90)
record of 22. Stevcic also has the
most career points with a whop
ping, and he still has twelve games
to play in this, his final, season.

Chris Pryor became the
fifth person in Bullet history to
have three assists in one game. If
he keeps this up, Stevcic's record
will not last very long. Pryor said
of his performance, "In the Mes
siah game we had our problems
scoring, I am just glad that we were
able to put the ball in the net against
Washington, especially, because
they are in our conference."
Though fighting off the
boredom, goalkeeper Jon Katerba
managed to handle all that was put
near him (0 shots) as he recorded
his second shutout of the year (12.5
in his career). A big part of the
shutout was the defense. Katerba
said, "The defense has really been
picking up lately, as well as the rest
of the team. We had our problems
early in the year, but our play has
really picked up and hopefully will
continue for the rest of the season."
Also scoring in the game
was senior midfielder Brian Hull,
and two freshmen midfielders, Bret
Coulson and Geoff Dolan. Fresh¬

men Jim Nastasi also had an assist
late in the game. It seems as
though the Bullets have good stock
for the years to come.
The team's next home
game is this Saturday against Cen
tennial Conference foe,
Muhlenberg at 3:00 pm.
Muhlenberg is currently

ranked #12 in the nation and #2
in the region. This is a key game
to the Bullets' season and hopes
to be nationally ranked. So, come
out, and support these guys in theit
quest for the Centennial Confer
ence. Note: Jumpin' John
Malcolm turned in another spar
kling performance, and cohort Ja
son Vishio also showed off his
fancy feet.

the Lady Bullets have pulled off a
string of six straight wins. The
Bullets have knocked off Cortland,
arch-rival Messiah, and they also
took second place (due to point dif
ferential) at the Spalding Cup in
Oneonta, NY by defeating
Oneonta and Hartwick.
In Oneonta, freshman Ryan
Rodriguez earned defensive MVP
honors. The Bullets'great turnout
in this out-of-region tournament
resulted in regional and national
rankings. In the region, the Bul
lets are only behind the College of
New Jersey and Elizabethtown.

In the opening week of Cen
tennial Conference play, the Lady
Bullets went 2-0. They narrowly
escaped Franklin & Marshall by a
5-3 tally. Their latest battle was
against the Mules of Muhlenburg.
The Lady Bullets showed their re
silience by coming from behind
and pulling off a win in overtime. '
Centennial Conference Player of
the Week, Amy Brewster, slotted
the winning goal only 4:48 into the
overtime period off of a pass from
Shannon Blair. The Bullets are
grateful for Brewster's return af
ter being sidelined for a year due
to an ankle injury.
The Lady Bullets' toughest
tests are yet to come. One of the
most pivotal matches of the sea
son was played here yesterday ver
sus Elizabethtown. The outcome
could change regional rankings.

Despite injuries to three key
players, the Bullets have weath
ered the storm by using their full
roster to win games. Unfortu
nately, Laura Zinck is out for the
season due ' to a knee injury but
Emily Brown and Paula Connard
will return to the field this week.





Sport Spotlight

Advantage Yoshida

by Chesha Miller
StaffWriter Masako Yoshida is the most
talented and experienced player
ever to join Gettysburg's women's
tennis program. The first year stu
dent, from outside of Tokyo, Ja
pan, cannot remember the first
time she held a racket in her hands.
Perhaps her family may have
something to do with that.
Yoshida's father owns the local
tennis center, where she began
practicing every single day at the
age of 12. In addition to that, her
mother, Kazuko Yoshida, is the
only Japanese woman to ever win
Wimbledon. She accomplished
this feat in 1975. Yoshida says her
mother's success did not force a
tennis career on her. In fact, un
der her mother's influence, she de
cided not to play professional ten
nis.

Yoshida had her brush with
the pros during high school when
she toured internationally as a Jun
ior player. Junior players are the
professionals under the age of 18.
Yoshida toured, playing in 13 or
14 different countries during her
school vacations when she was
between the ages of 15 and 17.
She practiced every day on
indoor and outdoor courts. She
was given programs of playing,
running, and weightlifting.
Yoshida did not play tennis her
senior year of high school, as she
felt she needed a break before
playing again at Gettysburg.
During her years touring she
learned to speak English, which
she believes is the language you
need to know to get around in the
world today. Yoshida's coach at
this time was Canadian, and the
only form of communication be
tween the pair could be English.

Yoshida had three different
personal coaches in her career be
fore coming to Gettysburg. Two
of the three were Davis Cup play
ers and the third, a friend of her
mother's, was ranked third in Ja
pan in addition to being interna
tionally ranked.
Yoshida was too busy tour
ing all over the world in high
school to play for her high school
team. She did, however, play for
her team at Gakushuin Girls Jun
ior and Senior High School dur
ing her junior high years. Yoshida
had hoped to attend high school in
the United States, but her parents
thought she would be too far away.

She finally got her wish when she
was applying to colleges.
Yoshida thought that it
would be a great experience for her
to study in the United States, and
an especially wonderful way to
brush up on her English. Yoshida's
first decision was to study on the
east coast, as she wanted a real
taste of American life. She be
lieves that there are a large num
ber of Japanese people living on
the west coast, and she would,
therefore, remain in a form of her
own culture instead of learning
true American culture.
In addition to this, for
Yoshida the most important aspect
of college life is an education. It
was this notion and the campus'
beautiful countryside location that
led Yoshida to Gettysburg. She
visited Gettysburg, as well as some
other small Division III schools
last spring and, as they say, the rest
is history.

So far, Yoshida's career as a
collegiate athlete has gotten off to
a great start. Last weekend, she
defeated the second seeded player
in the Centennial Conference in a
dual meet against Carnegie
Mellon. Yoshida was worried as
to what the outcome of the game
would be, as it was really close
throughout the match, but she
thought, "It was a lot of fun. It is
really great to concentrate on
something competitive. It is a real
way to challenge myself."
Gettysburg Women's tennis
coach Bill Pfitizinger is very proud
of Yoshida's game. "She has a
very, very good all around game,"
said Pfitizinger, "She is a very
mature and intelligent player." The
coach is impressed that she doesn't
get flustered or angry at herself
when she makes mistakes, nor
does she get too excited when she
is playing well.

Pfitizinger is looking for
ward to the Rolex Intercollegiate
tournament to be held at The Col
lege of New Jersey this weekend.
He believes that Yoshida, who is
ranked third in the region, after
only playing one game, has the
ability and talent to win this tour
nament. He also has high hopes
for Yoshida and her doubles part
ner, senior Tara Schmitt.
If the pair, or either one of
them in their singles game, win the
tournament they will advance to
the National Rolex tournament
which will be held in late October.

Speed and grace-Misako Yoshida serves
up some of the best tennis in the country.

Masako has the ability and the
talent to advance to the nationals,"
according to Pfitizinger, "We don't
want to put too much pressure on
her though. I certainly won't be
disappointed in her however she
finishes [this weekend]."
Yoshida is very excited
about the tournament this week
end, but she does not want to think
about it too much. This will be her
first time playing, so she simply

plans to do her best. "I'm a bit
behind since I didn't play all sum
mer, but I will do what I can. It
will be a learning experience," says
Yoshida.
Masako Yoshida is doing
very well for herself at Gettysburg.
She is concentrating on her stud
ies as much as possible. It is a bit
more time consuming and difficult
for her than the average Gettysburg
student, as this is her first time

studying in English.
In addition to her studies and
playing tennis, Yoshida has found
the time to join the International
club and start a Japan Club on cam
pus. Yoshida deserves recogni
tion, not only for her superior ath
letic talent, but also for her dedi
cated determination so far away
from home.

Assistant Sports Editor
The Gettysburg Bullets foot
ball game this past weekend
against Western Maryland was, in
a word, disappointing. The Green
Terror put on an offensive show
that culminated in a 55-7 win over
our Bullets. Even expert analyst
Chris "Sweet Lou" Lunardi was
speechless about the loss.
The Green Terrors of West
ern Maryland came ready for a war
on Saturday, and battle they did.
The offense, led by Nate DeFreitas
and Mike Sermarini, chalked up
474 yards and scored a total of nine
times including field goals. The
defense held the Bullets to 203
yards and one touchdown.
Although the Bullet offense
was uncharacteristically quiet this
game, Paul Smith still managed to
gather 178 all purpose yards.
Matt Helwig scored the lone
Bullet touchdown on a five yard
run early in the second quarter.
Turnovers hurt the offense
the most, however. The Bullets
lost the ball eight times through
fumbles and interceptions, while

the Green Terrors only gave up the
pigskin once. This turnover ratio
was a key in the Bullet loss.
The defense walked away
from Musselman Stadium a bit
battered as well. Despite the per
formances of Kevin Gurski and
Jason Osborn, with 14 and 10 tack
les respectively, the Bullets just
could not contain Western Mary
land. This week the Bullets are
trying hard, as Derek Reed says,
"To learn from the loss and move
on." This was made a bit tougher
with the losses of Jay Jablonski
and Don McNellis.
However, they are gearing
up to travel to Swarthmore (0-2)
this Saturday at 1:00, undoubtedly
thinking about revenge for the last
game the whole time. And, as we
all know: Paybacks are hell.

football team won 27-6 against
Dickinson on Monday. Pete
Devlin, Brian Pojanowski, Jeff

byDanLarian
Mews Editor Two Gettysburg College
students were arrested Friday
evening for firing a peJlet-gun
from a Majestic apartment and
struck one person.
According to Gettys
burg Chief of Police Gantz, the
two students, Brian West ('00)
and Mark Baker('OO) were each
charged with one count of reck
less endangerment, one count of
conspiracy, and one count of
propulsion of a missile or pro
jectile into a roadway.
One person was hit by
the students' shooting, Laura
Whitver of 2476 Mummasburg
Road in Gettysburg. She was
uninjured by the shooting.
Whitver was unavail
able for comment at this time.

According to her husband Gary,
the two had been eating at the
Lincoln Diner with friends and
were standing in the parking lot
when they heard a loud noise
that "sounded like a BB gun."
According to Gary,
Laura felt something strike her
leg. "She didn't pay to much
attention to it, then it happened
again," he said.
The couple heard
more shots including one that
echoed and "sounded like a
twenty-two rifle," according to
Gary. Ms. Whitver contacted

the police with her personal cellular phone.
A police detective arrived, and the shoot
ing commenced again.
The detective traced the noise to
the Majestic apartment complex across the
street from the diner. The police entered
and searched the complex.
The police traced the shooting to
Baker, a resident of Majestic, and West, a
resident of Patrick. The students were ap
prehended and arrested.
West declined to comment on the
incident. "I have nothing to say at this
time," he said.
Baker was unavailable for com
ment at press time.
When asked if the incident had
soured his opinion of Gettysburg College
students, Mr. Whitversaid, "I'm not sure it
was so good to begin with."
Mr. Whitver said that the incident
did not really bother him initially, "but af
ter I began thinking about, I realized the
severity of the incident."

Mr. Whitver says that immediately
following the incident, he encountered
some Gettysburg students who he felt
"failed to recognized the severity of what
had happened."
He stated that he hoped that "the two
students don't feel any animosity toward
us. If the shoe was on the other foot, they'd
do the same thing."
He also stated "what happened
is too bad. I hope that this sends a mes
sage that this kind of stuff is not to be tol
erated."



In and Out" offers support, social activities

by Ann Mane _Bielli
Staff Writer
Many of you have prob
ably seen the numerous flyers
posted around campus for the
newly established "In and Out
group." "In and Out" is a student
support and social group for
gays, lesbians, and bisexuals
here at Gettysburg College. Bill
Gohl, the assistant Chaplain, is
the staff leader of the group and
T. J Scott and Alec Beekmans are
the student facilitators. "In and
Out" has only been active for a

short time now; however, they are
off to a very successful start. Bill
Gohl stated, the group is "off the
ground and going well, and I am
very pleased with the way it is
going." Much of this initial suc
cess is due to the support "In and
Out" has received from gay and
lesbian students involved in Al
lies and also from the support of
Margaret Anne Radford
Wedemeyer, the Associate Dean
of the College.
"In and Out" was formed
in response to students requests
and also from the voices of vari
ous administrators who believed

Gettysburg College was in need of
such a group.
Gettysburg already has the
Allies group, which also deals with
the subject of homosexuality; how
ever, the Allies group on campus is
a total community organization;
faculty, administrators, towns
people, sexual minorities, and those
who support sexual minorities all
make up the members of Allies. The
"In and Out" group on the other
hand is exclusively for gay, lesbian,
and bisexual students. There are no
townspeople or straight people in
this group and the only administra
tor involved is Bill Gohl, and he
insists his only purpose is to pro
vide the space for the students to
meet and to cook the food they eat
during their meetings.
Unlike Allies, the purpose of
"In and Out" is not education or

activism, it is strictly to provide
support and fellowship for gay, les
bian, and bisexually students. "In
and Out" is trying to facilitate a safe
space for openly gay, lesbian, and
bisexual students and also for those
who are also still "in the closet".
Alec Beekmans stated," In and Out
gives those people who are strug
gling with their feelings a good en¬

vironment to foster self esteem.
When dealing with a contro
versial subject such as homosexu
ality there is bound to be some sort
of conflicts. Fortunately, "In and
Out"' faced only minimal opposi
tion. Bill Gohl stated that one staff
member wanted to know what ex
actly Bill was telling the students
in "In and Out". She was hoping
Bill was trying to "convert them"
because she believed that was the
only way to help them get out of
sin. Bill simply responded by say
ing, "we must reach out in Christ
love to love all people, however
God created them."
There were also some nega
tive opinions voiced by students.
Some students were upset that the
assistant chaplain was going to be
a leader of a group for gays and
lesbians. However, the small
amount of controversy that did
surround the establishment of "In
and Out" did not cause any major
problems.

"In and Out" had its first
meeting last week, their next meet
ing is October 9lh _, from nine until
eleven. The meetings take place
every other week at a unknown lo
cation off campus. To participate
in "Tn anH Onf " yon must fill nut a

confidentiality contract, these
contracts are located in the CUB
and should be returned to . Bill
Gohl either by campus mail or in
person. The contract states that
members are never to disclose the
location of "In and Out's" meet
ing place or the names of anyone
who is there. Alec Beekmans has
stated that these contracts are
necessary for safety reasons only,
"It is important that students on a
campus like this feel safe."
Although Alec knows that
there have been no major "gay
bashing" activities at Gettysburg
College, he has stated that anti
gay feelings have been voiced and
therefore these confidentiality are
a necessity for the safety and se
curity of "In and Out's" members.
"In and Out" is hoping they will
be able to expand as time goes on;
therefore, their first major goal is
to bring one or two new members
to each meeting, allowing for even
more gay, lesbian, or bisexual stu
dents to be able to participate and
benefit from their worthwhile or
ganization.

REPUBLICANS- from p 2
Representing the College
Republicans as Mr. Goodling's
guests were Sophomores John
Dunlap, Rob Ricca, and Ian
Isherwood. First-year students
Cammie Grant, James Brown, and
Sara Masko also attended.
The event was held at Ski
Liberty and featured a country
western band which at times in
cluded Congressman Goodling
and his wife Hilda.
In his remarks, Represen
tative Goodling praised
Gettysburg's College Republicans
and went on to talk about upcom
ing battles in Congress.
The Congressman chairs
the United States House of Repre
sentatives Committee on Educa
tion and Workforce, which handles
all education and labor legislation,
which is of particular importance
to Gettysburg College.

Last year, he spoke be
fore Student Senate and debated
his Congressional opponents in the
College Union Building.
In his last race for Con
gress, with support from
Gettysburg's College Republicans
who campaigned for him in Get
tysburg, York, and Hanover,
Goodling was overwhelmingly re
elected with 63 percent of the vote.
Through the College Re
publicans, Goodling has extended
an invitation for any group on cam
pus to come and arrange a visit in
the United States Capitol Building.



Common Hour delivers death penalty debate

tyMkhefeFIdds stqffwriter What is your opinion of the

death penalty? This is a question that
nearly everyone has a strong opinion
about. Last week's Common Hour

addressed this issue.
The forum, titled "Deciding
on the Death Penalty," seemed to pro¬

duced mixed reactions from the audi
ence. Lisa Bartle from the Death Pen
alty Information Center in Washing
ton, D.C. came on campus to shed
some light on this very controversial
subject. Because of its long connec
tion with US history, she argued, capi
tal punishment is often excluded from
how we define cruel and unusual
punishment. Though we no longer
have public hangings in town squares,
the death penalty is still an incidence
ofexecution.
Bartle provided the audi
ence with vital statistics and data about
the issue of capital punishment.
In 1976, there were412ex
ecutions, and this year there have been
27 in Texas alone. Those 27 make up
half the total that has occurred this year
Texas, along with Florida
and Virginia are all states with high
numbers of executions. However,
there is a growing trend in the number
of states exercising their ability to use
the penalty.

"A greater number of
people are being sentenced to death,"
she said. In Pennsylvania alone, there
are over 200 people on death row.
Race has been brought into
the arguments a main factor in whether
the convicted person is executed or
spends life in prison.
According to Bartle, when
race comes into play, "it makes more
difference who the attorney is than
anything else. Even more than the
nature of the crime."
She argued that in a country
that averages 20,000 homicides per
year, a strict punishment needs to be
enforced., whether or not the answer
is the dealh penalty.
Mental retardation and
mental illness factor into the sort of
punishment that one receives. Can
they be tried or executed? Are they
competent to stand trial? These ques
tions will produce a wide variety of
answers, yet psychologists have found
that there is an extremely high rate of
mental illness among prisoners on

Death Row.
Is the Death Penalty forgiv
able? In 1970 alone, 72 Death Row
p risoners were let go because of inno
cence. Eight years is the average stay
of a Death Row inmate.
Could innocent people be
executed? _Bartle suggested that States

are taking away money, lawyers, and
time from Death Rowprisoners, which
may lead to cases that are investigated
less thoroughly. If this happens, more
innocent people could be convicted.
Of the 3309 total American
prisoners on Death Row, she asked,
"how many do you think are inno
cent ?" Bartle projected that "it is
very likely in 1997 to see more execu
tions." 54 execution have already
taken place and in the next four weeks,
17 more are scheduled , though she
stated "that doesn't necessarily mean
that it will go through."
Ms. Bartle also addressed
issues of politics , which are closely
tied to the subject of capital punish
ment She claimed that "politi
cians don't publicize that executions
are taking place, yet as politicians, we
are in favor of it." She noted that the
issue is often used in election and then
disposed of.

She also noted that
Pennsylvania's Governor Tom Ridge
signs death warrants regularly, and sets
dates for executions. Bartle suggested
that this was Ridge's way of saying
"Look what I'm doing." This is done
more for shown than for deterrence of

. Bartle stated that in 1993,
Duke University studied the costs of
executing prisoners versus the cost of
life imprisonment. The study showed
that the cost ofexecution exceeds the
cost of non-death prisoners by over $2
million. About 70 percent of the
population claim that they are in favor
of the death penalty. But those who
oppose it often feel very strongly about
it. Lisa Bartle's lecture pro
vided a forum for the information con
cerning this difficult issue to be aired
and discussed.

Marching to the Bullet beat

bySamHeriey Contributing Writer
Make no mistake about it;
the Collegiate Marching Band
Festival held in Allentown last
Sunday was only for entertain
ment purposes.
"There's no score. This is
not a competition; this is an ex
hibition," band director John
"Buzz" Jones said.
Be that as it may, the
Gettysburg College "Bullet"
Marching Band, the only Divi¬

sion III band out of the 10 per
forming schools at the Festival,
managed nothing less than a
strong showing, Jones said.
"The band did very well,
and I was pleased with the stu
dent leadership," he commented.
A crowd of more than
5,000 people was in Allentown
to observe the "Bullet" Band
give its first exhibition in over a
decade. The band was one of five
at the Festival which performed
to the music of legendary com
poser John Williams.

The student-led "Bullet"
Band, with its theme entitled
"Great Moments in Cinema: A
Tribute to John Williams," did
pieces from films such as Star
Wars, E.T., FarandAway, Raid
ers of the Lost Ark and Empire
of the Sun.
Past field show themes in
clude a medley of songs from the
hit Broadway musical Les
Miserables and songs from the
American Old West.
The other bands perform
ing in the Festival were
Kutztown University, California
University of Pennsylvania,
Shippensburg University, Bos
ton University, Morgan State
University, Indiana University of
Pennsylvania, the University of
Delaware, Penn State University
(with its famous Blue Band), and
West Chester University.
Each band performed for
10 to 20 minutes.
The Festival was "totally
awesome," according to junior

band member Erica Strang.
"It was neat seeing the other
bands' interpretation of the music.
And I got to talk with members of
other schools' bands."
Junior T.J.Scott agrees. "See
ing the [Penn State] Blue Band was
amazing. It was really interesting
seeing other bands performing."
The idea for the theme, which
proved popular with the band mem-

efforts to this point," Jones said.
The band is continually add
ing new details to its performances
and had to know between 60 and
70 drill sets for the festival in
Allentown.
"That's really a lot of
moves," Jones said.
Even so, "I personally like
it [the field show]," said Strang.
"It makes it so much more inter-

getting back up, which is good."
Strang is a theater major
with a music minor. Scott is a his
tory major.
The band consists of all
kinds. "The band's grown from
about 50 to 80 members in the last
five years, so it's been a nice,
steady growth," Jones said.

Band members work hard to create the field show seen at the football games. They rehearse
every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 4:15 to 5:30.

bers, all began with one of the
band's student leaders, junior Drum
Major Brian Ritter.
"He played the tape for me,
and we agreed that it would be our
1997 production," Jones said.
"The music is really a crowd
pleaser_," according to Scott. "I've
heard great comments about it."
Although there is always
room for improvement, the band has
made great strides since it first held
a three-day camp prior to orienta
tion in August, Jones said.
"After a month of doing it, I
think we can be really proud of our

esting than just standing on the
field playing. When we do it right,
it looks great."
"I love making pictures to
music," she added.
According to Scott, this
year's field show is "one of the best
ones I've been in."
The "Bullet" Band, cur
rently standing with 80 members,
is having one of its largest years
ever in terms of participation. Of
the members, about 15 to 20 per
cent are music majors.
"It was down to 10 or 11
percent for a while, but now it's

band members from looking at the
transcripts of the incoming fresh
men, sending out interest forms,
and word of mouth.
Some band members may
have joined simply because their
friends talked them into it.
Strang had been in march
ing band throughout high school,
and joining the "Bullet" Band was
simply the next logical step.
"I always knew I'd be in the
marching band," she stated.
Every member is in the
band simply because of a love for
music or performance, but Jones

and others are hoping to find a way
for them to get more from their
efforts.
"We're working very hard to
see that these individuals will be
able to earn credit. It's been one
of those long, drawn-out issues
that we're still working on," Jones
said. The band, which performs at
all the home football games, is the
only marching band in the Centen
nial Conference.
The band is hoping that up
coming events such as Parent's
Weekend, Homecoming and an
away game at Lebanon Valley in
November will be as successful as
the Festival in Allentown.
"I think that what is so im
portant for the students is that
they're getting extra support from
the campus. There's a certain pride
as to the way they carry them
selves; when they get support, it's
a real boost," Jones said.

There is a strong bond tying
the band together. "As the semes
ter goes on," said Strang, "the band
becomes more and more bonded.
There's a lot of unity. A stab at
one section [of the band] is a stab
at the whole band."
"It's a family," Scott as
serted. "Theie_'s great leadership.
Brian Ritter is amazing. And band
has really enhanced my college
experience. It's my relaxation."
Some might wonde* at
consdering having to learn 60 or
70 moves, and a number of musi
cal pieces as well, relaxation.
Scott explained that while she's
playing, she forgets about her
school work and can simply con
centrate on the music.
"It's an escape," Scott said.
Even with all the upcoming
events, the Collegiate Marching
Band Festival will no doubt re¬

main special to the Bullet Band.
Being able to perform in such an
event is a rare opportunity, and al
ready the "Bullet" Band is look
ing forward to returning next year.
"The band really enjoyed it.
We anticipate doing it again, as
long as it's not a conflict with
home football games," Jones said.



Cookies,wiener dogs, and nuclear physics

byCaraMasucci
Contributing Writer
Okay, let's face it. Who
does not have an image in their
brain of what a physics professor
should look like? I have one; or,
actually, I had one until I met Pro
fessor Sharon Stephenson, one of
the latest additions to the
Gettysburg College community.
When I met with
Stephenson, my first thought was
how easy-going and relaxed she
was. In the background I heard
some really cool music playing,
and as I glanced up at the wall, I
noticed an x-ray of a very small
animal.
I then learned that it was an
x-ray of Bart, her pet dachshund.
She even has a picture of him on
her web page. The page was pretty

interesting, and I highly recom
mend checking it out. The stu
dents in her lab have been lucky
enough to have been graced
with Bart's presence this past
week in one of their classes.
She even has a "dog people"
address book. How can you be
intimidated by that?
Stephenson might be so
relaxed and easy-going be
cause, like so many on campus,
she is new this year. After com
pleting her undergraduate work
at Millsaps College, a small lib
eral arts college in the South
that is much like Gettysburg,
and completing her Ph.D. at
North Carolina State in nuclear
physics, she went back to her
undergrad alma mater and
taught for a short while. She

then decided to make the move
to Gettysburg.
Upon questioning h er
about her reasons for coming to
Gettysburg College, I learned
that she came here and sat down
for lunch with all the physics ma
jors. She thought they were
great, and she found the whole
idea of the small liberal arts col
lege to be something really spe
cial. Since she has been here,
Stephenson has found everything
to be really special. The faculty
and staff of the physics depart
ment have been "absolutely
fabulous." Everyone was really
helpful in getting her set up and
on board.
Outside of physics, she
had one really important thing to

say about the college: "The cookies
in the dining hall are excellent!"
She has also found the town and
battlefields to be very beautiful. In
fact, you can often find her running
out on the fields adjacent to the col
lege. Another thing that Stephenson
likes about Gettysburg is the diver
sity within such a small town. She
thinks that the Latino population of
fers an aspect to the diversity of
Gettysburg that most small towns
lack. The conversation soon turned
from the area to Stephenson's chosen
field: physics.
Physics has been a male-domi
nated field in the past, and many
women are now filling the void of a
consistent female perspective in the
sciences. As I learned, science is not
anything new to Stephenson.

Growing up, she was exposed
to all sorts of different scientific back
grounds, and it would only be fitting
that she would choose one of them.
Having asked about her influences,
and who she felt had influenced her
the most, she spoke about her family.
A long line of scientists, including her
mother and aunt, had an influence that
is now easy to point to.
It would be nothing odd for
Stephenson to be a woman in a man's
world. In fact, the only discrimina
tion she has received for being a
woman has been from older profes
sors who were not brought up with
the notion of a woman as their equal.
Everyone else treats her as their equal.
Stephenson likes physics be
cause of all the concepts and infor
mation made readily available to an
individual, if they choose to look at it
in depth.
She also expressed an interest
in physics because "it kicked my
butt!" "When I finished, it was such a
rush!" According to Stephenson,
physics is like philosophy, and she
found that idea exciting. And that is
why she changed her major from En
glish to physics.
As her time here increases,
Stephenson hopes to get more into her
concentration of nuclear physics. She
will be giving talks on her disserta
tion, and next semester hopes for an
opportunity to teach a first year semi
nar about the role women have-had in
the sciences throughout time. Cer
tainly, this is a seminar fit for Profes
sor Stephenson to teach!

Tonight at 8 p.m. the prover
bial curtain rises on Kline Theater
as the fall mainstage production,
Milcha Sanchez-Scott's Roosters,
opens. This, the first play of the
1997-1998 season, will run Octo
ber 3,4,6, and 7 at 8 p.m. There is
also a Sunday matinee on the 5th
at 2 p.m. Tickets are required for
the Friday, Saturday, and Sunday
performances.
Tickets can be acquired ei
ther at the theater department of
fice in the basement of Brua Hall
or at the table in the CUB during
lunch this week.
The play does contain some
Spanish, but don't worry if you
have no Spanish experience; a page
of the program is devoted to a glos
sary of the words contained in the
play. As a guide to those who are
not familiar with theater terms, I
will define a couple of words for
you that might aid in understand
ing the style of the play:

byGlenBeck
Staff Writer

Realism : as the word im
plies, this is the accurate represen
tation of real life as it occurs every
day "Magic realism" : applies
to the incorporation of fantastic or
mythical elements matter-of-factly
into otherwise realistic fiction
Presentational: elements of
the play may oppose what happens
in real life; i.e., some characters
may address speeches directly to
the audience, walls are see
through, the use of slides and
screens, etc.
In other news, one-act audi
tions will be held in the Green
Room (in the basement) of Brua
Hall on Wednesday, October 8, and
Thursday, October 9, from 3:30-6
p.m. The productions will be stu
dent directed, and range from a va
riety of styles, both comic and dra
matic. A wide selection of play
wrights will also be represented,
for a total of eleven different plays
in total. No prior acting experience
is necessary.
As a side-note, Professor
Emile Schmidt is still looking for
blue-grass musicians to play for the
winter musical, Cotton Patch Gos
pel . If you play, or know some
one who plays, that kind of music,

And you think
you're confused?

byJonFr oehlich
StaffWriter Howard Bracken's life was
perfect. He had the perfect job in
a perfect little American town and
was engaged to the perfect
woman. His life simply couldn't
get any better - so it got worse.
As soon as the two simple
words "he's gay" were uttered
over national TV waves by
Howard's former student and now
Oscar winner Cameron Drake,
played well by Matt Dillon (The
Outsiders, Drugstore Cowboy ,
Singles), Howard's life was turned
upside down, and small-town
America suddenly became a Hol
lywood media circus.
With its mission clearly set,
In & Out plunges forward and at
tempts to tackle one of societies
most complex issuesrhomosexu
ality.

In the tradition of a previ
ous "Seinfeld" episode involving
homosexuality, in which the
phrase: "not that there's anything
wrong with that!" was repeatedly
being thrown at the audiences, In
& Out uses comedy to dilute and
deal with one of America's more
uncomfortable and volatile topics.
All the characters of In &
Out work very nicely together, as
a good cast should, to deliver the
difficult themes that are inherent
to the plot of this movie.
Howard Brackett, played by
Kevin Kline (Dave, A Fish Called
Wanda, Fierce Creatures, French
Kiss) is the perfect small town
high school teacher whose kind
manner make him popular on all
levels of the community. Despite
how well he is liked, though, In &
Out presents a sad facet of reality
in that, for most of the movie,
much the town of Greenleaf
judges Brackett negatively be
cause of the possibility that he
might be gay.

What In & Out really tries
to get at is the role of these atti
tudes regarding gays in all walks
of life - especially those that put
them in contact with kids.
Another crucial part of the
plot is the melodramatic news an
chor Peter Malloy, played per
fectly by Tom Selleck (Magnum
P.I. ). As part of the media on
slaught that besieges Greenleaf
after Cameron's infamous an
nouncement, Malloy is instrumen
tal in making this movie what it
is. Through his comic portrayal

of a self-admittedly sleazy Holly
wood reporter who is, in fact, a ho
mosexual, Malloy helps Brackett
figure out who he really is.
Brackett's only refuge as he
sees it, is represented by his fian
cee, the emotionally fragile Emily
Montgomery, played by Joan
Cusack (Grosse Pointe Blank).
Perhaps more distressed than any
one at the prospect that her fian
cee of three years may be gay,
Emily's character offers much of
the mild comedy that audiences
will find in In & Out.

While it is fairly clear that
In & Out is supposed to be funny,
the comedy proved to be a little
inconsistent. When it was present,
it was purely situational and fairly
uncreative.
Although there were a few
very funny scenes in In & Out
(such as the scene in which
Brackett is listening to a mascu
linity tape), much of this movie's
appeal will come with its honor
able mission and uplifting conclu
sion in which the town of
Greenleaf rallies in a triumphant
display to Brackett's side.

Even with the sometimes
drastic transitions from comedy to
heavy drama, In & Out must be
given points for keeping audiences
hanging with the question that is
on everybody's mind: "Is he gay?"
In & Out works mostly
through Greenleaf's locals but re
ally delivers a final, powerful mes
sage through super-star Cameron
Drake. In his fictional Oscar win
ning role, Drake plays a gay sol
dier who, though he excelled in the
military, is discharged from the
service because of his homosexual
preferences.
Some great parallels are
drawn between Cameron's fic
tional story, in which he delivers
a cheesy message, and Brackett's
real story, in which Cameron de
livers a real message.
Director Frank Oz (House
Sitter, What About Bob? ) takes on
a real challenge of approaching
one of society's toughest issues
armed only with light comedy and
solid characters.

Despite this substantial
goal, In & Out was, for the most
part, an entertaining, more "cute"
than extremely funny, movie that
harbors an encouraging outlook
on the issues it tries to tackle
through its fairly captivating
storyline.

Simultaneously, he must en

The film is quite creative
with many humorous moments. A
couple of my favorites include the
math teacher with his comments
everyone loves, but no one can un
derstand. Also, keep your eye on
that advanced animation. Seeing

two hamburgers in love, just does
it for me.
The film is amusing, but in
order to appreciate it, the viewer
must be a child of the 80's. It does
provide such lines as "And dying
when you're not really sick is re
ally sick, you know. Really!"
"Gee, I'm real sorry your mom
blew up, Ricky." and the skiing
advice "Go that way. Really fast.
If something gets in your way,
turn." Anyone who enjoys this
movie immensely will be happy
to know there is a web page
strictly devoted to the film. It's at
www.siue.edu/~jpuscze/bod.html.

From the very start of the
opening credits, audience mem
bers will know they are in for a
8O_'s flick. The lines, the colors,
the music could come from no

Editor's Note
In the past few weeks, there have been numerous problems with Focus. This is a combination of errors on my part and errors on the printer's part. For all the problems, I
sincerely apologize.



Dear Casey...

Dear Casey,
I am finding that I am fall
ing behind in my classes and that
my grades are beginning to slip.
My work load has increased a lot,
and it is getting harder and
harder to concentrate on my
studies because I get so frus
trated that I am behind. This
problem is only aggravated by the
constant interruptions from
phone calls and people just stop
ping by to visit. I sally don't
want to fail out. Do you have any
advice?
Thanks,
Slipping in the Grade-Yard
Dear Slipping in the Grade
Yard.

Indeed, the main focus of
college is obtaining an education,
although this goal is difficult to
accomplish if you are giving your
self an ulcer over school work.
Ulcers are as about as conducive
to a learning environment as drive
by shootings are. I highly suggest
you don't let things get that bad.
In order to alleviate your
stress, let me start by telling you
that it is nearly impossible to read
every single word of every single
book that every class assigns. In
order to do this, you would have
to cut yourself off from all social
activity. Ostracizing yourself from
social activity is not very produc
tive, now is it?

What it sounds like you
need to do is structure your time a
little more carefully, and watch out
for opportunities to get a little
reading in. The key to being more
productive and less frustrated in

college is to do your work in man
ageable segments.
Sometimes being in a col
lege environment it is hard to con
centrate, especially when all your
friends are going to LD's for late
night coffee, and you're still pour
ing over 300 pages of Women's
History. Regardless of how inter
esting the material, you would still
rather be doing something else.
Maybe instead of studying
in your dorm, study in a little nook
in the library, or in the Junction,
or anywhere where you will not
be distracted.
Lastly, don't worry about
what you're missing socially, or
for not being available for your
friends. Trust me, if it is impor
tant, they will find you. If not,
you'll be sure to hear about it later.
Best of luck in avoiding a tomb
stone in the grade-yard!

Dear Casey,
My boyfriend, whom I
have been dating for almost a
year and a half, now lives in
Montana. He told me recently
that he thinks we should see
other people. He claims that
the distance thing is causing a
strain on our relationship, and
that even though he cans a lot
about me, he thinks it is only
fair that we not confine our
selves to an exclusive relation
ship. Fair? I don't think this
is fair. What do you think?
Sincerely,
Suffering from Unfair
ness

Dear Suffering from Unfair
ness, Believe it or not, no one ever
said life was fair, and if they did,
they were wrong. I think your
boyfriend makes a good point
about "confining ourselves to an
exclusive relationship." Even
though it seems unfair now, it
probably makes a lot of sense.
There is a quote that I think
is appropriate for your situation
that goes a little something like
this: "If you love something, set it
free. If it comes back to you, it is
yours to keep. If not, then it was
never meant to be."
If you have faith that your
relationship was strong to begin
with, then time and distance will
not necessarily have a detrimen
tal effect on it. This time apart can
not only allow him to test the wa
ter, but also give you time to do
the same.

Don't burn bridges, because
sometimes they can never be re
built. Don't go looking for guys
with a vengeance. Respect your
boyfriend's decision. He seems to
be looking out for your best inter
est, and I am certain this was not
an easy decision for him to come
to. Think of it this way, he
could have lied to you. Instead,
he was straightforward and hon
est. I think he deserves a lot of
credit. So do not sit around and
mope, get out your party shoes and
have a good time. The world is
awaiting! Good luck.

This Side of Cynicism

A Few Words About Student Senate

bylanlscher wood
StaffWriter As of recent, the attack has
resumed on the Student Senate
which has become (at least in the
press), a common direction for dis
dain on this campus. I serve and
have served as a senator and, I
must confess, that such attacks are
not without warrant. Senate's role
last year in student affairs was
rather minimal, and the few items
which we discussed were not en
tirely adequate. I served through
my first term very frustrated with
the slow pace of senate operations
often to the point of constant criti
cism for the organization which I
was an elected member.
Oftentimes, our debates were
trivial, such as the assigned seat
ing issue last spring, but the abuse
in which we currently are meeting
has caused an influx of enthusiasm
through the Senate.

At the end of last semester,
Senate realized that reforms were
needed so that we could be a more
united and strong body for the ben
efit of student affairs, and work as
the liaison of such affairs to the
administration. Now, I am not
writing on behalf of Senate, nor am
I being an apologist for "the sys
tem" (what is this imaginary "sys
tem" which we all blame any
way?), I am simply writing of the
recent events and of the future of
our central governing body on
campus. Such a need for Senate

reform has caused a new style of
meetings based upon efficiency.
The introduction of club meetings
has caused senators to better un
derstand the many organizations
we sponsor. The advantage of our
monthly closed meetings is that
they give Senate more time to
gether as a whole body to debate
and discuss legislation without in
terference or overburdening for
mality. This is in my opinion, a
very fair style of meetings to com
bat the inefficiency of the Student
Senate.

The common misconception
about senate is that we are a gov
erning body of accountants who
are only used for handing out
checks to organizations on field

trips. Granted, most of our time is
eaten up by finance, but we are
much more than that in ideal. To
be perfectly honest, my primary
concern as a senator is not one of
finance. If I wanted to hand out
checks I would work for the Penn
sylvania lottery (which is a hor
rible institution of degradation, but
I will talk about that in another
column). We are not elected for
our financial genius, I know I
wasn't appointed for that, but
rather, because of my leadership
and sense of judgement. So why
then, is Senate held in such low
regard? Well, because of several
years of only serving as a student
budget board for activities. Oh
yeah, there is that twenty-four hour
library thing which is very appre
ciated, but what will Senate do in
the future?

If anyone attended the Sen
ate meeting this past Monday, they
would know that we have a very
different Senate this year as op
posed to senate in years past. The
Senate chamber was an open fo
rum of debate, and for the first
time, I as well as many other sena
tors, were excited to be represen
tatives. The primary concern of
senate is to represent the public and
such a concern was evident
through our differences and debat
ing. Senate has thus become in one
short month, an enthusiastic forum
of ideas, and by such ideas, effec
tive debate and diversity is accom
plished. My complaint is that now
Senate has unified itself behind the

banner of efficiency, but still the
oftentimes unfair attacks come
from all sides. How strong is our
Senate if all the public does is just
sit, complain, and whine about it?
If students want change, then
please, call our officers and com
mittee heads and present before the
whole body. Call a class senator
who will champion your cause.
Just don't sit around and complain
that senate is a joke. We have a
very different Senate this year
which makes me proud, and has a
great bit of potential. I just hope
that such potential is not killed by
apathy. There is that word again
which hurts the ears of our cam
pus community. It seems around
this time every year our campus

catches the apathy bug, or scien
tifically lameus apatheticus, which
is certainly not the fault of the Sen
ate. I have written twice now on
the constituent responsibility
theme and I am tired of it. Check
out the board in the CUB and look
up your representatives, and if you
don't, then please keep your mouth
shut because it makes even this
cynic sick to hear such unjust rub
bish. We have a progressive Sen
ate which wants to work (and we
are trying), but we need help from
the people we represent. Look for
Senate Works week in the CUB
where we'll have a table staffed by
senators taking complaints and
concerns. Check your e-mail for
senators writing about their goals
and view of senate as a whole. The

most important senate meeting this
year will be an open forum later
this month to listen to your voices
so that we can effectively write and
pass legislative opinions concern
ing the student body. Senate is
only effective as those in which we
represent. Keep that in mind.
Today is another town meet
ing which I hope is more than just
a yalping and yelling session like
last year. I just hope that our voices
will be listened to and not merely
heard. There is much disdain on
this campus and it appears that the

administrators have their hands
tied behind their backs. Last year
the town meetings seemed like a
very good idea on the outlook, but
in my opinion, they were just used
for public relations. It looked like
communication was improving,
and it looked as though the admin
istration was listening to the cam
pus community. We commonly
see our suggestions neglected, or
just forgotten over time. I want the
administrators this year to prove
my disdain wrong. I am begging
President Haaland to make me eat

my cynical words. I hope that the
opinions expressed are seriously
considered or examined so that
Gettysburg may be a more enjoy
able place to live. In all probabil
ity though, such thoughts are
merely idealistic _cliches. Rather, I
am tired of begging for progress,
it is time for some actual work to
be done from all sides.

by Kevin Howard and Erin
Patterson Public Relations Chairs -IFC and
Panhel Ladies and gentlemen wel
come to Greek Week! We have
some exciting news to report to
you today. Yesterday, at the Greek
Week carnival, we introduced for
the first time the King and Queen
of Greek Week. Enough suspense,
the more than qualified winners
were Abigail Rodgers from Delta
Gamma and Andrew McAllister
from Theta Chi. Congratulations
for being the role models of the
Greek campus for 1997 - 1998.

Abby has held many posi
tions within her chapter as well
within the Greek community. She
has been the Panhel Chief Justice,
Vice President Rush, and Vice
President Management. She was
also the undergraduate Interfrater
nity Institute intern and the Greek
life intern. On campus she is ac
tively involved as Student Senate
President and has also held the
position of Secretary, and Vice
President within Senate. Abby has
been on the Project Lead steering
committee for three years, the Co
director of the Women's Center, a
member of the President's Com¬

mission on Women and a member
of the Student Life Council. As
well as all of these accomplish
ments on campus she has received
many awards to solidify her posi
tion as Queen of Greek Week. She
has received the Outstanding So
rority Sophomore award, United
States Student Government Award,
Outstanding Residence Hall Vice
President and the Alfred J. Hamme
Award. She has clearly proven
herself as an extremely valuable
asset not only to her organization
but to the entire campus as well.
Andy has held executive
positions within Theta Chi such as
Secretary his sophomore__year and
is currently finishing out his term
as President. As President he has
helped guide his chapter through
the changing times of this campus

and the B YOB policy. Aside from
his accomplishments within his
chapter, he has also offered his ser
vice to the National Park Service
by helping to clean the 20th Maine
monument area on the battlefields.
His philanthropy work doesn't stop
there. He has also helped raise
$ 1300 for Theta Chi to be donated
to the Wee Care Day Care Center.
He and his chapter have been very
active with Load-ins at many of the
concerts and has participated in the
Greek Leadership Series with John
Regentin and the Sophomore
Leadership Series with Tom
Dombrowski. As far as awards,
Andy has received the Outstand
ing Sophomore Award in 1996,
Ritual Certification - Theta Chi
National Convention and comple
tion of the Sophomore Leadership
Series-. Andy has been a great ex
ample of an exemplary represen
tative for the King of Greek Week.
Congratulations to Abby and Andy
on a job well done and for being
great models for the Greek com
munity.

In other Greek related news,
Sigma Nu took time out of their
schedules on Sunday, September
29 to help clean up after the Mi
grant Worker Fiesta which was
held on campus.
Just a reminder, at 4:00 in
the quarry, behind Bream/Wright/
Hauser, Greek Week's annual tra
dition of Mud Volleyball will con
tinue. Get prepared for a great time
and some dirty clothes. If you can't
compete, you don't want to miss
watching every one else get dirty
while trying to play volleyball in
about six inches of pure filth. It is
a great time for all. Tomorrow at
8:00 pm, the much awaited
Airbands competition will take
place and if we haven't mentioned
it before, we will mention it again
- DON'T MISS IT. Another rea¬

son to go, if the acts aren't enough,
all of the proceeds from the event
are going towards Gamma Phi
Beta's philanthropy, For the Love
of Lori.

Letters to the Editor


"Townie " Understands...

To The Editor,
I recently read a commen
tary in the Gettysburgian entitled,
"Welcome back . .. most of you".
I am also a Gettysburg resident. I
cannot speak to the frustration
which that resident obviously
feels. However, I might offer the
following words on the subject.
I know all too well the "sour
taste" a few "bad apples" can leave
since working with gang members
as a volunteer in a Texas juvenile
probation center for a couple of
years. However, to focus on a few
thoughtless students, would be to
ignore the many dedicated and
well-adjusted young men and
women here as college students
who take their futures and their so
cial responsibilities seriously.

I'm not saying that problems
don't exist. They do. However,
as "townies", let's try to under
stand and remember that we were
there once. It's an age that moves

most through adolescence to adult
hood, from insecurity to confi
dence, from contemptuousness to
an understanding that "we're all in
this together." There will doubt
less always be those who can't
quite make these transitions in life,
but from what I've seen here from
my view of the campus, they are
proportionately few. To those few
who throw the beer cans and cups,
disturb our sleep at 2 AM, cut
down our trees, speed and smoke
your tires on our streets, etc., etc.,
it wouldn't do any good to address
you anyway.
To the majority of students
who are on a higher level of
thought however, and who accept
responsibility for their actions,
thanks for being here with us in
Gettysburg. We do appreciate you.
Kindly,
Mike Sanni
Townie

I've met Jesse
Helms, and you're
No Jesse Helms...
To The Editor,
I would first like to begin by
congratulating Matt Brown, on his
From the Donkey's Mouth column.
The column was weil written and
made many interesting points,
however, most I tended to disagree
with. One line that very much dis
turbed me though was the line,
"Mr. Helms a known racist." I
have met Jesse Helms, and I have
a friend who works for the Senior
Senator from North Carolina, and
I can assure you that the Chairman
of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee is not a racist.

It is sad that such a despi
cable work has to be thrown
around so much. I have been
called a racist before, why, because
of my conservative beliefs. I am
not. Mr. Brown, if you would like
to find some racist, then you
should look to your own party and
Senator dictator who is a former
member of the Ku Klux Klan or
the Reverend Jesse Jackson, a pos
sible anti-Semite, who called New
York, "Hymie Town," because of
its Jewish population.
It is an insult to the people
of North Carolina to say they
would elect a know racist. My
roommate when I served as a Page

in the United States Capitol is an
African-American from the state
of New Jersey, who while holding
moderate to liberal beliefs came to
respect and enjoy one of the nic
est men in United States Senate,
the Honorable Jesse Helms. Lib
erals do not like Jesse Helms be
cause he stands up for what he be
lieves, something that both politi
cal parties need more of. Let's
save that terrible word, racist, for
the people in our society who truly
need toe shunned. If the word is
nothing more than a political at
tack, then it loses its meaning. I
think we can disagree without be
ing so disagreeable and mean spir
ited. Sincerely,
John Dunlap, '00

Consider this

Over the past few weekends,
t seems that there have been more
md more groups out wandering
he sidewalks of Gettysburg. In the
>ast, these groups have always
>een walking somewhere. Now,
hey're just walking.
The time will come in the
lot-too-distant future when the
ludents of Gettysburg will run out
_>f things to do.
As bad as they may have
_>een, fraternity parties provided a
nuch-needed outlet for the cam
)us. They gave students some
hing to do on the weekend.
This year, fraternities are
nore reluctant to have parties.
Vhen they get fined for something
is minor as using the wrong kind
)f holepunch for the "drink cards,"
t is easy to see why there are fewer
mrties this year.

Some may see this as a good
hing. However, this cut-back on
)arties has had very detrimental
:ffects on the college community.
As great as the SAC spon
sored events are on the weekend,
here is no way that the whole col
ege can fit into the Junction, or
sven the Ballroom.
And people determined to
irink will drink.
The crime stats of recent
veeks have shown an increase in
he busting of parties in dorms and

off-campus apartments. Instead of
partying at fraternities, people are
now partying in their rooms.
This week, a resident of Get
tysburg was shot with a BB gun
by an intoxicated college student.
There is no way to prove that
these are the events of fewer orga
nized parties. But it is doubtful
that they would have happened if
the students involved had been in
a fraternity house those nights.
When bored, students have
very little to occupy their minds.
The tiniest thing can set a drunk
person off.
This kind of attitude has led
to anti-homosexual graffiti around
campus. While many do not think
homophobia is a problem on cam
pus, this kind of act shows how
biases come out when the mind is
idle. The next few weekends look
fairly safe. This weekend is Fam
ily Weekend. Next weekend is
Reading Days.

But what then? There's a
long gap between Reading Days
and Thanksgiving. People are
bound to get desperate for some
thing to do.
Is this the fault of the admin
istration, or the fault of the stu
dents? Both. And it's up to both to
come up with a solution.

Random searches, an insult
to integrity...

To The Editor,
This week, Safety and Secu
rity is "randomly" searching dorm
rooms throughout most of the cam
pus. The searches will be unan
nounced, and if the residents are
not in the room, the security offic
ers will enter the room by them
selves. I was told the officers
would do a brief walk through of
the room and take notice of "ille
gal" objects or safety violations if
any. They will not open closets or
pry through personal possessions.
I am offended the college is tak
ing the liberty to search rooms.
For myself, random security
checks are degrading, disrespect
ful, and most of all, a violation of
my private space. Essentially, I
pay a rent for my room. I have
signed residential contracts and
have abided by all general rules. I
have nothing to hide, and I have
done nothing wrong. I am assum
ing that several incidents in dorm

rooms are prompting this check. I
am not against the rules, however,
I do think the one and only circum
stance a security officer should
check a room, is with probable
cause. I think it is the responsibil
ity of the Residential Assistants
and Residential Coordinators to be
familiar with the type of traffic go
ing in and out of rooms, and with
suspicions of illegal activity, a se
curity check is understandable.
Again, I have done nothing wrong.
Being searched because of others'
shortcomings is offensive. It is my
natural right to have freedom of
privacy regardless if my residence
is on public or private grounds.
Gettysburg College is violating a
principle of integrity, which as an
institution itself promotes integrity
through the Honor Code. Does the
college have the right to do this?
Probably, but I am questioning my
level of respect in the administra
tive services.

The Pachyderm's Pulpit

Stomping on the Democrat s Party

_byJohnDunlap
Staff Writer Politics may be the most
ironic part of life. Today, the Na
tional Democrat Party, in an attempt
to save itself, has become an imita
tion of the Republican Party, a kind
of Republican light. From 1972
with left-wing Senator George
McGovern's victory for the Demo
cratic Nomination until Governor
Bill Clinton's victory for his party's
nod in 1992, Democrats showed
their true colors by nominating
unelectable liberals with the excep
tion of President Jimmy Carter, who
was a product of the anti-Washing
ton Watergate period.
After losing in landslide
losses in 1972 and in 1984 with
Jimmy Carter's Vice President
Walter Mondale, and being defeated
once again in 1988 with liberal
Massachusetts Governor, Michael
Dukakis, Democrats decided to imi
tate the GOP. Former President
Ronald Reagan has called the
Democrat's attempt at imitation, the
most sincerest form of flattery.

Only by pretending to be me-too
conservatives will Democrats out
side urban America be able to win,
and the Republican stance on crime
has been working in New York City
with Mayor Pudy Guilliani.
Whenever Americans have a
choice between a liberal and a con
servative, the conservative almost
always wins. Only when Demo
crats cloud the issues with negative
attacks like President Clinton and
the liberal unions did in 1996 can
they survive.
For forty years Democrats
controlled Congress, the liberal
leadership was even able to survive
the Reagan era. With the election
of a Democrat President in 1992,
who governed as a liberal his first
two years, with the largest tax in
crease in American history and an
attempt at national socialized medi
cine did Democrats have to show
their true colors. No longer could
Congressional pork and catering to
local issues work, they moved to the
left and they were defeated.
American politics were al
tered in 1994, we no longer had Re
publican Presidents and a Demo¬

cratic Congress; we now had the re
versal, but this time, the GOP was
in control, not the Democrat Presi
dent. To save his political life, Bill
Clinton slithered down the ideologi
cal scale _^ moving towards Newt
Gingrich and Congressional Repub
licans on balancing the budget and
welfare reform.
The biggest irony in politics
today is that while the Democrats
are desperately attempting to be
come Republicans, Democrats are
calling Republicans extremist. Is it
extreme to balance the budget, is it
extreme to cut taxes on capital gains
to spur the creation of new jobs, is
itextreme to reform Medicare, so it
can be saved and not allowed to
wallow and die, and is it extreme to
reform welfare? At one time or an
other President Clinton with the use
of foreign campaign contributions
said all of these things were ex
treme, but guess what he gave in ev
ery time to a Republican Congress,
who believed in something that is
unusual in Washington, called com
mon sense.
Democrats in 1964 called the
Republican Presidential Nominee

Barry Goldwater an extremist, but
today the ideas that he exposed are
being implemented by, who of all
people, a Democrat President. Lib
eral historians like to say that
Goldwater and McGovern both rep
resented the extremes in their re
spective parties, but while George
McGovern's agenda has been
thrown in the ash-heap of history,
Ronald Reagan swept into office on
the Goldwater platform, and back
in 1980, they called Reagan an ex
tremist. Ronald Reagan was cer
tainly not extreme, he brought con¬

servatism to the main stream. He
restored our economy and won the
Cold War, when liberals declared
that he would cause World War III.
Like Goldwater and Reagan
before him, Democrats today are
playing their old extremism tune
again. It worked in the Presidential
race when Bill Clinton and Al Gore
ran the most negative reelection
campaign since Lyndon-Johnson's
'64 campaign. They failed in the
Congressional races as Republicans
were reelected for the first time in
68 years. If Newt Gingrich is so
extreme, then why does Bill Clinton

pathetically follow him and then
take credit for what the Republicans
in Congress do? We all know the
answer: conservatism has won. Jn
Great Britain, Labor Party Leader
Tony Blair became Prime Minister
on a "New Labor" platform, very
similar to Clinton's "New Demo
crat" themes. In France even the
Socialist Party moved right to win
and they did.
This does not mean liberal
ism is dead, and the conservative
victory is permanent, Bill Clinton
continues to appoint liberal judges,

and we most likely will never get a
flat tax with President Clinton
around. Through Washington's
bloated bureaucracy, Clinton and
company continue to show down
the Republican rise.
What Republicans need to do
is ignore the liberals and move for
ward. Make the case for a flat tax,
fight for regulatory and tort reform,
and stand up to the Clinton
Administration's liberal appointees.
No, liberals are not gone, they just
have to be a little sneaky about their
ways, and they have the right Presi
dent for that.

Brayings on Race and the Futuie

Kefly Davis
Staff Writer Last week President Clinton
attended the 40th Anniversary of
the desegregation of Central High
School in Little Rock, Arkansas.
The event marked the anniversary
of the entrance of nine black stu
dents into the all-white high
school. In an address made at the
high school, President Clinton
challenged the nation to continue
to work toward improved race re
lations within the country.
As part of this challenge,
President Clinton will attend the
second meeting of his advisory
board on racial issues this week.
The advisory board was created
this June by the Presidt at in order
to initiate national discussion of
race relations within the country.
To some, the actions of the Presi
dent seem to be too little too late,
and still to others, it appears to be
completely necessary. I personally

think of it as a step in the right di
rection.
We are at a point in our his
tory where things seemed to have
stagnated. Maintaining the status
quo is easier than working toward
improvement. During the 1960's,
there were glaring injustices in our
nation's racial policies. There ex
isted clear goals for reforms in race
relations. Today things are a little
more ambiguous. Many of the
current injustices are easy to con
ceal and, as a result, easier to ig
nore. An example of this is the
attack on affirmative action over
the last few years. Many believe
that affirmative action has served
its purpose and is no longer nec
essary in today's society. The in
justices and inequality have been
removed. That would be great if
only it were true. Minorities are
still denied the opportunity of pro
fessional advancement solely
based on the basis of race. It is
still difficult for many minorities

to obtain positions at the level of
top management.
Sadly we still live in a na
tion greatly divided along the lines
of race and ethnic origin. I would
bet that most of us who attended
racially diverse high schools can
relate to the common lunch room
scenario. The black students sat
with the other black students. The
Latino students sat with the other
Latino students. The white stu
dents sat with other white students.
This is not to say that this was
some steadfast law. In fact, this
situation was governed by no law
at all. Schools have become de
segregated by law, but they remain
segregated in reality.
Perhaps in comparison with
other countries the United States
race problems are minor. When we
look at the numerous countries
currently engaged in civil wars and
forms of ethnic cleansing, our situ
ation looks especially rosy. But
maybe we are not that far away

from those scenarios. Of course I
am not saying that tomorrow a civil
war will break out, but occurrences
like those tend to start small and
grow over time.
I believe what is frightening
about today's current state of race
relations is that we are choosing
to separate ourselves on the basis
of race. No longer is there legisla
tion that separates us. Unfortu
nately no legislation can bring us
together. We have to do that our
selves.
President Clinton has chal
lenged us all to looked beyond our
own cloistered experiences and
view all that the people of our na
tion have to offer. It is often too
easy to stay within our safe, com
fortable existence. We associate
with people of the same race, reli
gion, and socioeconomic back
ground. Why is that? Because
it's easier. It takes an effort to make
a connection with those of other
cultures. Sadly it seems that we

are unwilling to make that effort.
Today we live in a world
where our schools are desegre
gated and the separate but equal
rhetoric has died. Still an appar
ent division exists. President
Clinton wants to initiate national
discussion of the topic of race re
lations. In his speech given at Cen
tral High School, the President
stated that discrimination still ex
ists in America and the gains the
nine students had helped achieve
40 years ago were being threatened
by reemerging, racially divisive
attitudes.
In many ways this attitude
will be much more difficult to
overcome than the injustices of the
sixties because this change will
have to come from within each citi
zen. Our government cannot force
us to come together. We have to
do that ourselves. President
Clinton can only begin the discus
sion. Now we have to engage in
it.

Rugby goes to the
wire with rival F&M

ByMattEisenberg Contributing Writer
On Saturday, September
27, The men's rugby team "took
to the pitch" versus arch-rival
Franklin and Marshall. The last
time these teams rumbled the af
tershock was felt as far away as
Saskatchewan, Canada. The game
ended in a tie last Saturday, but
neither team was satisfied and both
were out for blood.
The game was intense
from the start with hard hitting
from both sides. Gettysburg was
inside the Diplomats 22 meter line
for most of the first half. In the
tenth minute, the Bullets broke
through with a hard fought try by
senior forward Ben Graham. The
bullets made the extra kick and
were up 7-0.

The domination contin
ued, and with a penalty kick by
senior Ryan Bader the Bullets
were up 10-0. Bader led the team
on defense with thirty tackles. The
forwards dominated the line-outs
with help from senior fly-half
Brian "I need security" Johnson.
The Bullets showed tre
mendous heart during a five
minute stand behind their own 22
meter-line. They stopped the Dip
lomats dead with help from fresh
man standout Craig Wilson and

sophmore, back turned eightman,
Rob Ricah.
At the start of the second,
the Diplomats came out strong but
were unable to break through the
wings, sophomores Eric Aiello and
Chuck Weber. Dermot Nugent
also played exceptionally well for
his first game at fullback. The Dip
lomats finally broke through in the
fifteenth minute with a try of their
own. Another try was scored five
minutes after the first. "We played
hard, but we still need to work on
conditioning," said President Steve
Arcuri. The score was 12-10.
The Bullets picked up their game
but on this day it simply was not
enough. A bad decision late in the
game by senior Captain Matt
Eisenberg set the Bullets back be
hind their own 22 meter line and
there was not enough time left.

The Bullets played tough
throughout the match. "We'll just
have to pick up our level of play,"
stated Arcuri. He was confident,
though, that this Saturday the Bul
lets would be ready for
Susquehanna at home.
Susquehanna is coming
off a tough game against Bucknell
which ended in a tie, 5-5.
Susquehanna boasts a big pack, but
this sportswriter is optimistic that
the Bullets will make their parents
proud.


Hockey Highlights

Bullets blast
Swarthmore. 64-15

Shooting high:

JoshEyler Assistant Sports Editor
The Gettysburg Bullets (1
1) absolutely, positively spanked
Swarthmore (0-2) last Saturday.
No doubt about it. The score was
64-15. One would think that with
a win like this the whole game
was a blowout. That person
would be wrong. As a matter of
fact, the score was tied 15-15 at
halftime.
Then, like bats out of hell,
the Bullets scored five times to
start the melee. Chris Lunardi
said, "They just didn't know what
hit'em."
It was definitely the Bullet
backfield's day in the sun. Matt
Helwig was named Centennial
Conference offensive player of
the week for his performance.
Helwig covered 149 yards on 10
carries. He scored three times
from eight, 45, and 24 yards, re
spectively.

The only guy to stop
Helwig on that day was a small
green land mammal resembling a
leprechaun. Sprinting toward the
endzone for an apparent touch
down, Matt was tripped up by the
green man, and stopped ten yards
shy of the endzone.
Paul Smith, who leads the
conference in all-purpose yards
with 609, rushed for 145 on Sat
urday and scored two times. Just
for reference, no little green men
got to Paul.
Two freshmen quarterbacks

led the helm for Gettysburg on
Saturday, and both played ex
tremely well.
Jeff Boyd ran for 90 yard
on seven carries, and Dennis
Flaherty threw his first collegiate
touchdown pass: an eleven yard
toss to junior Jeff Closz, who
scored twice in the game. Derek
Reed also scored for the Bullets.
The meager Swarthmore
offense managed to score only 15
points, all of which came in the
first half. Leading the Bullet bar
ricade was Jason Osborn. Osborn

was named to the Centennial
Conference Honor Roll for his
nine solo tackles and a 36 yard
scoring interception.
Both Rob Sena and Joe

Hodakowski also had interceptions. Rounding out the killing
machine were Tom Olchon, Kevin Gurski, Chad Mire, Gene
Kraus, Matt Ritz, Chris Felton, Justin Domingos, Scott Grabus,
and Brian Murphy.
This week, the Bullets try to keep that fire as third place
Johns Hopkins comes to town. Everyone is anxious to show the
Bluejays what Gettysburg is all about. As Matt Helwig says,
"We're gonna rock their world."

Women's Soccer on a nine
game winning streak

The Bullets Women's Soc
cer Team is still surging ahead by
adding three more strokes to the
win column this week. This puts
'their winning streak at nine games.
Last Wednesday, the Bullets
moved up to the second slot in the
Mid-Atlantic Region with a huge
win over the Blue Jays of
Elizabethtown. A first half goal
by Amy Brewster proved to be all
that the Bullets needed to slip by
the Blue Jays.
The Bullets' defense frus
trated the Jays all day with their
off-sides trap, preventing any scor
ing opportunities. Senior Goal
keeper and captain, Beth O'Boyle,
chalked up her fifth shutout of the
season with an outstanding perfor-

Contributing Writer

mance.
The weekend was a bit of a
reliever for the Bullets, when they
beat Bryn Mawr 6-0. This con
ference win left them 3-0 in the
Centennial Conference and just
behind Johns Hopkins (due to
goals against).
Amy Brewster and Lauren
Frankford each netted two goals,
while Paula Connard and Lauren
Scott added one apiece. Patsy
Cors provided two assists and
O'Boyle now has six shutouts on
the season. After this game, Amy
Brewster was named to the Cen
tennial Conference Honor Roll for
her game winning goal against
Elizabethtown, and the two more
that she added against Bryn Mawr.

After these two games, the
Bullets moved from 19 to 11 in the
National Division III Rankings,
and from three to two in the Mid
Atlantic Region poll.
On Tuesday, the Bullets re
mained undefeated in the confer
ence with a win against
Swarthmore. However, the Bul
lets were tested once again when
the Crimson Tide took them into
overtime. Patsy Cors put the first
goal on the Scoreboard late in the
second half, but it wasn't enough
for the Tide's rally.
Regulation play ended in a
1-1 tie. The Bullets dominated
their opponent by pelting them
with 21 shots as compared to
Swarthmore's three. In the over
time period the Bullets were too
much for the Tide to handle.
The Swathmore goalkeeper
misplayed a long range shot by
Lauren Frankford 13:38 into the
overtime period to allow the Bul
lets to preserve their 4-0 record in
the conference.

The Bullets are now look
ing toward the week ahead of
them. They travel to Ursinus on
Saturday for their fifth conference
game, and return home on Sunday
to take on regional rival, Richard
Stockton. The Bullets are out to
seek revenge for the 3-1 loss that
they suffered at Stockton a year
ago. Kick off is at lpm.
The Bullets are also at home
on Wednesday, October 8, for yet
another conference battle against
the Green Terror of Western Mary
land.

Football Notes : Stepping up to play quarterback this
week will be freshmen Dennis Flaherty and Jeff Boyd. Both
have shown tremendous quickness and the ability to lead the
offense.
Intersting fact of the week-- while Halfback Matt Helwig
and Fullback Paul Smith play completely different positions
and have different running styles, they have "mirror image"
statistics.
Paul Smith has carried the ball 43 times for 324 yards;
averaging 108 yards per contest.
Matt Helwig has carried the ball 42 times for 324 yards;
averaging 108 yards per contest.

The soccer playing fields at
Gettysburg College are a far cry
from the streets of Mexico- and no
one knows this better than senior
Greg Stevcic. Stevcic, Gettysburg
Men's Soccer Team captain, has a
background different from most
Gettysburg students.
Greg has quite an interna
tional history, as his mother,
Lilianna, is from Argentina and his
father, Jugo_, is from Yugoslavia.
Greg was born in Mexico, where
he lived until 1984 when he and
his family moved to Medford, New
Jersey.
Stevcic spent a good part of
his childhood learning the art of
soccer while playing in the Mexi
can streets. There Stevcic learned
his skills while practicing with
BoraMinutilovic, his father's good
friend, as well as the Mexican
World Cup Team's head coach.
Stevcic spend his weekends im
mersed in soccer-either watching
games or practicing with
Minutilovic's professional team.

Greg Stevcic is playing his final season of Bullets soccer, and he is going out
with a bang

byCheshaMiller
StaffWriter

Greg, an attacking center
midfielder played an integral role
on his high school team. He scored
the winning goals, both his junior
and senior years at Shawnee High
School, in the state championship
games. A true athlete at heart, he
spent his high school years as a
three season athlete, playing soc
cer, tennis and also swimming.
In 1994 Greg followed his
older brother, swimmer Jugo
Stevcic, to Gettysburg. Greg was
very happy to come to a Division
III school where he could continue
both his soccer and swimming ca
reers, as well as pursue his aca
demics.
At Gettysburg Stevcic is
able to dominate the soccer field

and unwind in the pool, an
experience he calls "huge".
Stevcic's favorite event in the
pool is the 200 meter Individual
Medley (50m of each butterfly,
breast, back and free strokes),
however, his main athletic focus
is always soccer. "I swim for
fun," explains Stevcic, "I love the
atmosphere of the team."
Coach Rawleigh and the
swimmers are great!"Stevcic has
played quite an impressive soccer
game for Gettysburg. During his
sophomore year Stevcic broke the
record for most goals in a season
(21). The following year he broke
the records for the most goals in a
career and for the most career
points, which are now 37 and 97,
respectively.
As a sophomore and junior
Stevcic was named to the first team
All-Centennial Conference, as
well as to the Regional Ail-Ameri
can team. This past weekend
Stevcic broke his fourth Gettys
burg soccer record, the most career

assists, for which he has 23.
For Stevcic soccer is a part
of him, it is, as he says, "in [his]
blood". Stevcic describes a cer
tain feeling that comes over him
when watching the game of soc
cer. He says, "my favorite part of
soccer is the times that I get so in
spired in a game that I feel I can
do anything. The result really can't
be explained in words." Much of
Stevcic's passion for the game has
come from his father, Jugo.
"He was the one who pushed
me and made me tough," explains
Stevcic, "he kept my head straight,
to be sure it never got too big, and
he taught me to never be satisfied
and to always look to be better."
Stevcic also has gained much of
his inspiration from Michael Jor
dan. "He drives me to do what I
do. I admire the way he handles
pressure, training, his confidence,
his theories, and his appearance on
and off the court," remarks Stevcic.
Gettysburg men's soccer
coach David Wright calls Stevcic
one of the best players he's ever

coached. "Greg is a very talented
player," says Coach Wright, "he
has vision and recognition of what
is happening as it happens in a
game." Stevcic is able to convey
what the team should do in situa
tions to his teammates while play
ing. In a game like soccer, which
has not timeouts, this is a very im
portant skill.
Coach Wright describes
Stevcic as a different type of soc
cer player, "he expects the most of
himself and his teammates at all
times on the soccer field, and he
also has a hard time accepting any
thing less than perfection."
According to Coach Wright,
"Greg's heritage allows him to ap
proach the game in a different light
than the typical American born and
based player." Stevcic believes this
year's squad to be the best team he
has been a part of here at Gettys
burg. He resolves that despite the
slow start of the season the team's
destiny is still in their own hands,
and one of his personal goals is to
advance past the first round of the

NCAA tournament.
For Greg Stevcic the most
important part of his experience
playing soccer is the memories he
has made. Athletics have been en
hanced for Stevcic because of his
teammates. "The best part about
playing a sport is being part of a
team," explains a smiling Stevcic,
"[is that] you spend most of your
day with them, and the relationship
you form is really hard to find else
where."
Stevcic has been very fortu
nate to have the expertise and opin
ions of both his swim coach,
Coach Rawleigh, and Coach

Wright. A strong mutual respect
exists between Stevcic and Coach
Wright. Each appreciate and un
derstand each other's passions, and
enjoy sharing their enthusiasm
with one another. Coach Rawleigh
is an important guide in Stevcic's
life. He thoroughly enjoys giving
"Greggie" a hard time, and going
nose-to-nose with him at times.
Both coaches greatly admire his
competitive drive and passion and
claim it is Greg's intensity and zest
for life which makes him an ex
ceptional athlete.

Coach Wright believes that
Stevcic has what it takes to become
a professional soccer player.
Stevcic himself hopes to accom
plish this. This summer he plans
to try-out with a few professional
teams in England, or possibly play
forMinutilovic in Mexico.
He is excited by the possi
bilities and options which are open
to him. After try-outs, or playing
professional soccer, the Interna
tional Management major/ Span
ish minor, hopes to open an inter
national cuisine restaurant with his
brother Jugo. Whatever it is that
Stevcic ends up doing, it will
surely be done with passion and
excitement.



SportsWeekly
They can run like the wind blows...

Because our Gettysburg
Cross Country runners are so very
fast, it took us a full month to catch
up to them for an article. Luckily
their captains Kris Weum, James
Smith, Wendy Johnston and Martie
Calello, stopped running just long
enough to recap the past three
weeks of the season; and my word,
they have been busy!!
The season opened with a
home meet against Messiah and
Juniata three weeks ago on Sep
tember 6th, and from the sound of
things they started the season with
a great big bang - both teams be
ing first place finishers!
The men's team brought a
new meaning to the phrase "PACK
IT UP" with their seven varsity
runners placing 2nd through 8th.
Leading the for Gettysurg was one
of our first year students, Jon
Cattlett, finishing the race in sec
ond place with a time of 26:59.

by Contributing Writers

Bob Condon, our head Cross
Country coach for both the men
and the women, said, "I was sur
prised to see Jon up in front and
didn't believe he was that fast." He

then went on to say, "Jon s speed
would just help the team, making
everyone else run that much
faster!"
Coach was absolutely right
because the next four finishers
were within 37 seconds of Jon's
finish: the two seniors taking third
and fourth place being Jason Smith
with a time of 27:12, and James
Smith with a time of 27:15; fol
lowed by two juniors Kris Weum
(27:20) and Brendon Clark
(27:35).
Finishing the varsity seven
off strong, only a minute and fif
teen seconds off of their leader,
junior George Torgun was in sev
enth place (27:40) and sophomore
Dave Gary was in eighth (28:15).
The pack of seven was both quick
and tight. In Condon's words, "a
coaches dream!"

However the excitement
doesn't end there because the new
batch of freshman are getting
stronger and tougher each day.
Weum, one of the two Men's Cap
tains explains, "the upcoming crop
of freshman are definitely a help
and an awesome asset to the

team!" "The only problem," coach
Condon states disappointedly, "is
that a fewof our key players didn't
do much in the way of training this
summer, which puts us behind the
eight ball." Meaning that it will
take the team to mid October be
fore they'll be at their most com
petitive. At that time, however,
with everyone running well, just
think of what a "pack" will exist
then. All in all, it was a wonderful
way for the men to start the sea
son. As for the women, they
weren't to shabby themselves!
Three seniors, Wendy Johnston,
Martie Calello, and Joyce O'Neil
lead the team to a victory over both
Messiah and Juniata. Johnston
was the first to cross the finish line

Kris Weum clashes through the mud, and is apparently
"breathing right."

with a time of 18.31. Calello was
quick to follow with a second place
finish of 19:02. O'Neil finished
up the trio with a time of 20:07.
The next three finishers
were all first year students: Kristen
Mills, Kim Heimerl, and Tracy
Swackhamer. They all ran strong
with terrific determination, clearly
helping the team out toward their
first victory. Christine
Santeusanio, our fourth senior,
closed up the top seven finishing
strong with a time of 21:35.
Condon commented on the
women's performances explain
ing, "this is a peak year for the
women, the Seniors take _'the first
three spots and the youngsters are
in a pack not too far behind." He
also adds, "I'd like to see the time
between the gap be worked on, yet

these women have the potential to
be a truly outstanding team by the
time of Championships!"
The next meet that our Bul
let Runners faced was the Leba
non Valley Invitational on Satur
day September 13. This is an ex
citing meet because it' * the first
time we run some of the teams that
will be in the regional competition.
Wendy Johnston had a superb rac
ing day. Not only did she win the
Invitational for the second con
secutive year, but she also took a
few seconds off her time.
Condon reports, "it was nice
to see Wendy win it again. She's
still improving with every season
she runs!" Wendy was the first
place winner out of 251 overall
runners! Martie Calello was the
next finisher for the team and
placed sixth overall with a time of
20.13, taking a minute and seven
seconds off her time last year.
Joyce O'Neil ran 25 with a time
of 21:15 and is getting stronger and
stronger with each race.

The freshman pack followed
the top three to the finish line run
ning hard and feeling strong. Kim
Heimerl, Kristen Mills, Kelly Lord
and Tracy Swackhamer finished
the race, placing 71, 83, one 106,
and 118; each girl improving their
times from high school drastically.
Condon comments, "the improve
ment on the women's team is out
standing!" The women placed
fourth out of 24 teams...definitely
a job Well Done!!
Not only were the women
fast, but the men were also faster
than speeding "Bullets." Jon
Cattlett ran tenth overall with a
time of 27:05 showing absolutely
no intimidation being a first year
student. He was closely followed
by James Smith in sixteenth place
running 27:26; and Kris Weum in
nineteenth place running 27:32.

The pack of Gettysburg run
ners did not end there. Dave Gary,
George Torgun, Alex Franyo, and
Jason Rose finished up the top
seven placing 36, 42, 90, and 92.
The men's team finished thirrd out
of 25 teams. Coach commented,
"the guys had an excellent running

Party on
Fight leads to police bust;
Sigma Alpha Epsilon still in
good standing

byDanLarkin
News Editor A large crowd and an in
cident involving a non-Gettysburg
College student caused Gettys
burg Borough Police to shut down
a party at the Sigma Alpha Epsi
lon (SAE) fraternity house early
Sunday morning.
According to the Gettys
burg Police Department, at around
2:20 am, a borough police car was
patrolling Lincoln Avenue, when
the officers observed some com
motion at the fraternity house.
The police stated that
they noticed a group of males
hoisting another male subject
above their heads. The patrol
stopped to investigate the situa
tion.

According to the police
department, a large crowd, of what
appeared to be about 150 people,
had gathered outside the house.
Members of the crowd were ap
parently acting disorderly, and
some began yelling obscenities at
the police.
The police stepped in to
calm down the situation, and the
party was shut down.
The male subject who
had been hoisted up by the group
was arrested for public drunken¬

ness. Richard Sursick, the ar
rested subject, was not a student
at Gettysburg College but a visit
ing student from Johns Hopkins
University.
Apparently, Sursick was

involved in an altercation during
the party, which led to the scene
outside the fraternity house.
According to Dennis
Murphy, Assistant Dean of the
College and Director of Greek
Organizations, the SAE brothers
"were having a dance, and a non
student started an altercation out
front, which is what caused the
disturbance."
Brian Murphy, presi
dent of the Gettysburg SAE
chapter, stated that "the problem
was with one of the people in
side the party. The police came
by because of the crowd, and shut
down the party."
Dean Murphy stated
that he felt that the SAE mem
bers "used good judgement" in
dealing with the situation.
The SAE fraternity re
turned to campus in 1996 after a
four-year suspension and is cur
rently undergoing a probationary
period where no alcohol is per
mitted in the house.

When asked if the inci
dent would have any effect on
SAE's probationary status, Dean
Murphy answered in the nega
tive. "The problem was not with
the event," he said.
According to Dean
Murphy, Gettysburg College Se
curity checked the house and
"were convinced that there was
no alcohol in the building."

Candle in the wind
Fire causes "moderate
damage " to two dorm rooms

byHenr yFawefl
StaffWriter In the late evening of
Sunday September 28, a small fire
broke out in a Musselman Hall
dorm room, causing moderate
damage to the student's second
floor room, as well as that of an
other student directly above.
The fire was quickly ex
tinguished by Safety & Security
before the Gettysburg Fire Depart
ment could arrive.
A lit candle, left on while
one of the inhabitants was sleep
ing in the room, was determined
as the cause of the fire.
Erin Lawson, the East
Wing Coordinator for Residence
Life, stated that the fire was "fairly
small and pretty well contained.
Not too much property was af
fected by the fire."

However, the student
was in violation of a Gettysburg
College rule which states that no
candles, incense, or other lighting
devices may be used in a dorm
room. Thus, the violation was the
cause of the fire and subsequent
damage to the student's belong
ings. Furthermore, the smoke
which filtered out of the room
through an open window ended up
causing minor damages to the
room directly above on the third
floor. The flames were con
tained in the second floor room
until Safety & Security could ar
rive and extinguish them but not
before a number of questions con-

cerning the fire safety procedure
had arisen.
There was, in the mo
ments after the fire, an issue raised
concerning the reaction time of the
Gettysburg Fire Department.
It was said by many of
the dorm's residents that their ar
rival was surprisingly late. How
ever, Lawson stated that the Fire
Depar tment was already informed
that the flames had been extin
guished by the college security.
Furthermore the fire
alarms, one of which is installed
on every hall, did not sound. The
student sleeping the room was not
awakened until she heard a friend
banging on her door. In fact, the
alarms were not heard throughout
the dorm until they had to be
pulled manually.
The student sleeping, who
requested that her name not be
published, said that she "was very
upset the fire alarms did not go
off."

As for the damage, nei
ther of two residents was harmed,
but hard drive damage was done
to two computers in the room.
Both are in need of significant re
pair. Minor damages were done
to other pieces of private property.
Up until this past Sunday, the en
tire room was covered in soot,
making it uninhabitable.
The students who lived in
there stayed in a friend's room this
past week. They were, however,
offered other alternatives by the
school.

functioning - even though they
had no symptoms yet.
Some 92 patients had prob
lems with their aortic ormitral
heart valves, the report said. The
FDA said the numbers were much
higher than it had expected,
prompting it to recommend stop
ping sales.
Dionne said she has stopped
taking the drug but only had one
week left to take it anyway. She
said she's not worried about devel
oping any heart problems later.
"If the FDA determined it
was unsafe, then it should be taken
off the market. I don't feel sick,
but I did stop taking the drug just
to be on the safe side," Dionne
said. Trujillo said the popularity
of fen-phen was a tragedy waiting
to happen. He said last year, car
diologists from University Hos
pital in Denver had met to discuss
the and possible problems.

The popular diet drug com
bination known as fen-phen has
been pulled off the market, and ,
despite warnings form doctors,
some people aren't worried about
developing heart problems.
"I have had no side effects,"
said Melinda Dionne, a 30-year
old University of Colorado student
who has taken the drug for the past
four months. "I feel strong. I
could run three miles today if I
wanted to."
Despite how she may feel,
cardiologists and nutritionists are
apprehensive about possible long-

term side effects caused from the
drug. "Remember, high blood
pressure can develop very
quickly," cardiologist Nelson
Trujillo warned. "The truth is, we
have no way of knowing how long
someone has to be on this drug
before they develop problems."
The Food and Drug Admin
istration last week pulled Redux,
known chemically as
dexfenfluramine, and Pondimin,
known chemically as
fenfluramine, after the drugs were
linked to serious heart damage.

Fenfluramine is half of the
popular diet drug combination fen
phen. The other half, phentermine,
was not affected by the FDA ban.
The FDA asked manufac
tures to stop sales of the drugs af

Some American doctors
were apprehensive about prescrib

"Town meeting" addresses issues

From Staff Reports
The Thursday, October 2
Common Hour forum featured the
first "Gettysburg College Town
Meeting" of the 1997-8 academic
year. The town meeting is a New
England tradition, where every
member of the community is in
vited to raise questions and voice
concerns.
The College began holding
the town meetings last year, in a
show of effort to provide a forum
for student concerns.
Last year's town meetings
featured heated debate and hostil
ity over controversial issues.
Perhaps due to a low turn
out, the atmosphere of last week's
forum was decidedly more sub
dued. However, a few important
issues were raised.

Abigail Rodgers, President
of Student Senate and Gettysburg
College President Gordon
Haaland, fielded questions and
comments from students concern
ing the College community.
Abbey Rodgers began the
meeting by introducing many of
the campus student leaders in at
tendance to the audience.
Rodgers then introduced
what she considered to be the two
main goals of the Student Senate
this semester. The first goal, she

stated is "alternative social pro
gramming." As an example of this,
Rodgers spoke of the recent
BYOB Shrimpfest.
The second goal of Senate,
Rodgers referred to as "aggressive
outreach programming." This pro
gram, which she also referred to
as "Senate in your face," which
aims to create a more active rela
tionship between the Senate and
the student body.
President Haaland spoke of
bringing together the various areas

One of our
problems, as a
college, is to find
things that bring us
together"
President Haaland
of the college community. This,
he said, would "enhance students'
lives beyond the classroom."
Haaland and Rodgers then
opened the forum up for questions
and comments from the audience.
Many of the issues raised at
the meeting reiterated student con
cerns from last year.
The first question raised ad
dressed the issue of Easter Break.
Provost Dan DeNicola fielded the

question, stating that while the cal
endar does provide a day off on the
Monday following Easter, students
requiring travel time for the obser
vation of Easter and all religious
holidays, are encouraged to speak
with their professors concerning
the issue.
A student representing Stu
dents for Ethical Action questioned
the College's policy of denying fi
nancial aid to international stu
dents whowish to study abroad.
Haaland denied the student's
accusations of the policy being dis
criminatory, but stated that the
policy is "currently under review."
When asked how he felt
about the all campus BYOB par
ties, Haaland said that they are "a
very good idea... One of our prob
lems, as a college," he stated, "is
to find things that bring us to
gether."

This issue of alcohol and al
cohol-related violence occupied
the remainder of the discussion.
Dean of the College Julie Ramsey
stated that "the correlation be
tween alcohol and assault is nearly
one hundred percent. . . By re
ducing the amount of students who
abuse alcohol, we will reduce the
amount of assaults."
President Haaland added
that "we as a college have been
struggling, and will continue to
struggle with the issue of alcohol
and assault."

Bacchus, a non-senate
sponsored organization, appeared
before the Senate to ask for its fi
nancial support. The dollar
amount asked for was $680, for the
purposes of sending to students to
a training course. Bacchus argued
that they could bring their knowl
edge gained through the training
back to campus, and provide the
school with new ideas about social
life. After some debate, the
Senate voted in favor of the pro
posal and granted Bacchus the
money requested.

DRUG BAN

continued from p 3
scribed the combination.
"There has never been an
effective pill for weight loss,"
Turjillo said about the popularity
of the drug. "In the short term,
this drug showed substantial
weight loss quickly. It is in the
American mentality to think,
'Why exercise and eat well when
you can take a pill?"
Wardenburg
DieticianColleen Betas said she
never recommended the combina
tion either.
"We had a lot of requests
for it last spring, mostly from fac
ulty and staff," Betas said. "As a
nutritionist, I tried to discourage
them from it. I've never felt good
to have a society of pill-seekers,"
Betas said she encourages a
healthy diet and exercise.

Before going on the com
bination, Dionne had to enroll in
a nutrition class at Access Medi
cal Weight Management in Den
ver, the clinic where she got the
drug. Access Medical has since
stopped prescribing fen-phen and
has returned to giving patients
plain appetite suppressants,
sources there say.
The controversy over fen
phen arose after doctors at the
Mayo Clinic announced in July
they had discovered 24 cases of
a rare heart-valve defect in
women who took fen-phen.
Symptoms included short
ness of breath, chest pain, faint
ing, swollen ankles and legs and
sometimes a heart murmur.

Prescriptions of the drugs
have plunged since the first warn
ing was issued.

Gettysburg serenaded by new a cappella group

byMdodieFoster StaffWriter

Features
Instruments? We don't need no stinkin' instruments

Gettysburg does not have
a great history of a cappella on
campus. In fact, says senior En
glish major Jonathan Blake, "the
history is that there is no his
tory." Many college campuses,
especially large universities,
support groups which perform a
cappella, meaning without in
strumental accompaniment.
Northwestern University's
award-winning group, Melodi
ous Thunk (a play on the name
of musician Thelonius Monk),
has performed nationwide and
puts out a compact disc every
year. Though there have been
no such groups of this caliber at
Gettysburg, some smaller ones
have been attempted, but did not
get far due to a lack of resources
and/or organization. It is not as

though the idea has never been sug
gested; it's just never come to frui
tion. History is about to change.
First-year students Jenny Bland and
Doug Walsh have, in three weeks,
put together what is looking to be
the first coed a cappella group on
campus in a long time, if not ever.
The group does not yet have
a name, as Bland and Walsh wanted
the members to decide on one to
gether.
Unable to gain the support of
the Music Department in their en
deavor, Bland and Walsh went to the
Student Activities Council in order
to get an advisor, which would al
low them to be an official part of
campus activities, get funding, and
reserve a practice space.
Lynn White Cloud has offered
to serve as a temporary advisor for
the semester, but the group is still
looking for someone to permanently
fill the position.

Well advertised, the group
had a turnout of about 35 inter
ested people to the series of audi
tions held September 22nd, 23rd,
and 24th in the CUB Ballroom.
Callbacks took place on Wednes
day, October 8, where eighteen
"We want to
do songs
people know."
singers competed for between nine
and sixteen spots.
After the member are se
lected, Walsh and Bland hope to
have practice twice a week for two
hours in the Ballroom. Though
more of the auditioners were fe
male, the two founders hope to
form a group that has an equal
male to female ratio.

This will also be an experi
enced group, as many of the stu
dents who auditioned are also in
College Choir.
Walsh and Bland were both
active in a cappella groups at
their high schools. Bland received
her inspiration for forming the
group from her high school mu
sic teacher, a woman who pushed
Bland and two other students to
love music and to lead others in
this pursuit.
Walsh came to Gettysburg
this fall with the intention of start
ing a group.
"I wanted to be a pioneer,"
commented Walsh. "When I vis
ited, I didn't get the impression
that the college had an a cappella
group, and I felt that they needed
one. It's a great way to add spirit."
And add spirit it certainly
will. As it is not associated with
the Music Department, the group
will have a different repertoire

than the College Choir.
Most of the arrangements
will be supplied by Bland's high
school music teacher, and will in
clude a wide variety of music:
from pop to ballads to oldies to
barber shop quartets.
"Our goal is to have a di
verse repertoire," says Walsh. "We
want to do songs people know."
More than anything else, the
purpose of the group is pure en
joyment of music. It is made up
of people who love music, love to
perform, and want to share this
with an audience. Says Blake, "A
cappella is a great way for people
to get together and do something
fun." No performances have been
scheduled as of yet, but the two
people behind the idea hope, de
pending on the group and the prac
tice schedule, to be ready to give
the campus a taste of a cappella
by winter.

Roosters isn t worth crowing about

by Kathleen Gr eely
Staff writer If you missed the recent
production of Roosters, you
missed the best play performed
at Gettysburg in a long time.
You did not however, miss
the best performance of a play.
Roosters is a contempo
rary play about pride, faith and
familial relationships. Written
by Milcha Sanchez-Scott, it is an
emotional play that can be
deeply moving--if properly per
formed.
Although the crew was
able to create a magnificent
stage, the actors were often un
able to fulfill their part in the
production, due in part, to bad
directing from George
Muschamp.

The stage design by
Jerome Hanson, complete with
on-stage seating, was one of the
best sets to ever go up in Kline
Theater. However, it was not
enough to make up for the
shoddy performances given by

most of the actors.
The Shadows, played by
Mary Cordero, Mike Ferrer, Jeffrey
Jones and Glen Beck, who haunted
the teenage daughter, Angela, were
not even remotely frightening or
threatening.
Audience members could
barely make out many of the lines
delivered by Gallo, the father, and
Adan, a neighbor who is in love with
Juana, played by Rob Thompson
and Paul Lapato, respectively. Their
weak stage presence and flimsy ac¬

cents, coupled with an overzeal
_^^^^^^ ous sound staff
_^^^^^^^. that

turned _^^IfH
on the music too _'
soon and too loud, ru
ined any chance for a
meaningful perfor
mance.

Chata, the prostitute/aunt,
played by Megan Manthey, was
not nearly as sassy and snappy as
she should have been. As a result,
much of the humor that was writ
ten into this character was lost.
Alec Beekmans and Phil
Anderson, who danced the parts
of the actual roosters, were a ben
eficial addition to the production,
however, their dance was silly and
unrealistic, more the fault of bad

choreography by Paula
_^ _k Kellinger than bad
¦ _U acting.
_HB The pivotal
_^^ role of Hector, the
_^B family's son, was
_F played by freshman
_^_k Dav e Shoffner.
^¦Though
_^m his accent _^ k
W came and >A _^^
* w e n t_^l_^^H
through- _J_^^^_f
out the _^^^^_T
performance, ^^F
Shoffner's perfor
mance was a solid one.

The best performances,
though, were given by Samantha
Gregg and Jennifer MacMurtie.
Gregg played the mother,
Juana, who is frustrated by her life
but tries to keep her fueding fam
ily together. Although her Span
ish accent could have been better,
Gregg's acting, particularly in her
second act monologue, was pow
erful and convincing.
The most difficult role, and
the best per- / _^^-
formed, was that L_^_f_^_r
of Angela, played I_^R_^_aP_^r

by MacMurtie
freshman. An
gela is

the confused
teenage
daughter who
has tea parties

with saints, longs to be a child
again, fears of dying from neglect,
and wants desperately to have a
complete family. Though the char
acter spends a large part of the play
hiding under the porch of the fam
ily home, MacMurtie's ability still
shines through.
Although it was unclear
what happened to her character in
the final scene (the whole final
scene itself is confusing),
MacMurtie's performance was the
saving grace of Roosters.
In the end, it is the poor di
rection of Muschamp that ruins
Sanchez-Scott's play. The move
ment of the actors on stage was
unnatural; their actions were far
too deliberate. The presence of the
grandfather, played by Jeremy
Katz, was not a part of the origi
nal script and was unnecessary in
this production and often proved
to be a distraction.

Poor directing, bad chore
ography, and a lack of preparation
turned a great play into an often
painful performance.




A movie not to be wished for

byJonFr oehlich
StqffWriter "Something is going on here
- something bad," proposes char
acter Alex Amberson.
"I wish I wasn't in this the
ater." Though this prayer will
prove quite useless and ineffec
tive, viewers of Wishmaster will
probably find it irresistible to give
it a try just for kicks.

Death Angel, Toy Soldiers), is under
standably a little upset so is out to take
over the world as we know it.
The Djinn then proceeds to pa
rade around for the next hour in a
(theoretically) scary get-up that looks
as if it were made by a forgetful
mother in the waning moments before
Halloween night.
Since the legend dictates that
the Djinn must first gain the power
of human souls through the
_^^^^ granting of their wishes,
PjjOl much of the movie involves
maKm the Djinn performing

K§|_i the person who woke him
ByjJi| (Alex), the Djinn is con
'
imjjm stantly stalking the movie's
_KPraii main character.

The plot of
Wishmaster really speaks
for itself. Full of cheap plot
twists and uncreative dia
logue, Director Robert

Kurtzman (The Demolitionist)
doesn't offer audiences much to get
excited about.
Even though Wishmaster
will often be advertised under the
name of Wes Craven, audiences
shouldn't be fooled. The director
of such horror movies as Scream
and The People Under the Stairs
is only one many producers of
Wishmaster. Many of the movies
made by Wes Craven and other di
rectors like him are enjoyably
frightening because of smart plots
and classic characters. The only

thing scary about Wishmaster is
that someone was actually paid to
make it.
Though many of the above
criticisms of this movie are some
times what make horror movies fun
to watch and have earned them
their place in cinema culture,
Wishmaster just seems to take it
self too seriously. While it might
have fit in well about ten years ago,
when many others of its kind were
popular, audiences will most likely
be let down by how much
Wishmaster fails to compare to
movies of the horror and thriller
genre.

Get a Clue

byGlenBeck StaffWriter "It's a matter of life
after death; now that he's
dead, I have have life."
This is only one of the
many hilarious lines from
the 1985 movie based on
the Parker Brothers board
game, Clue. Directed by
Jonathan Lynn, the film
provides joke after joke
and gag after gag, that will
keep you laughing until the
credits.
The gala of stars in
clude Eileen Brennan
(Mrs. Peacock), Tim Curry
(Wadsworth), Madeline
Kahn (Mrs. White), Chris
topher Lloyd (Prof. Plum),
Michael McKean (Mr.
Green), Martin Mull (Col.
Mustard), and Lesley Ann
Warren (Miss Scarlett).

The talented comic
actors maneuver well
through the dialogue. The
quick pacing allows for

rolling laughs. An example of this
comes as Miss Scarlett and Prof.
Plum drive up to the scary Hill
House. "Why is the car stopped?"
asks Miss Scarlett. "It's fright
ened," replied Prof. Plum.
Besides very witty dialogue,
there is also a large amount of
physical humor in the movie.
Something very original
about the film is the three endings
that are included on the video.
Originally, different endings were
shown in different theaters, but on
the video, all three are included.
Wayne's World spoofs the
idea at the end of the film with their
own endings such as the "Scooby
Doo ending" and the "incredibly
happy ending."
Although there are a couple
of plot holes, the movie is a sure
laugh fest. The more times you
watch it, the more you'll pick up.
But you should be warned:
if a friend asks to borrow Clue,
she's probably asking for the
movie, not the board game.

El Nino predicts future weather

byStephBusch GECO Columnist
El Nino, a change in wind
direction which in turn changes the
weather conditions throughout the
entire world, occurs every three to
seven years. It is believed by many
scientists that this year's El Nino
may be one of the strongest ever.
What does this mean
for students here at
Gettysburg? Well, most
likely this year's winter will
be more mild than previous
years, and instead of a great
deal of snow, we will see
rain.

The effects of El Nino
vary for different parts of the
world. When the westward
blowing trade winds
weaken, it allows a mass of
warm water, which is nor
mally located off Australia,
to move eastward to western
South America.
The unusually warm
water acts on the jet stream
patterns which in turn alter

weather worldwide.
Most likely El Nino will
cause droughts in Australia and
Southeast Asia, as well as flood
ing in the Southern portion of the
United States.
Along the mideast and
northeast portions of the United
States, there will most likely be
mild winters and rain instead of
snow. It is difficult to pinpoint the
exact effects of El Nino because

of the many factors that can con
tribute to weather change.
The change in weather will
not only effect our everyday
lives, but will also have an effect
on animals.
For example, along the
coast of California, some marine
species are seen in greater abun
dance because of the warmer

ocean water, which is beneficial
for the fisheries.
However, there are some
species that depend on the sea
son changes and the cooler wa
ter temperatures. These species
may suffer from the mild winter
Fortunately, because El
Nino is a natural occurrence,
many animals are able to adjust
or adapt to the weather changes
without too many natural distur
bances.
Some scientists believe

that El Nino will have a great ef
fect on weather world-wide, while
other scientists acknowledge El
Nino, but feel it is difficult to pre
dict what is exactly going to oc
cur. Many effects have been seen
already throughout the world. In
fact, Indonesia is currently plagued
with severe droughts. These
droughts can effect crop

yield and production,
leading to economic tur
moil and distress.
It is therefore un
derstandable why El
Nino has become such a
controversial and talked
about issue, due to its
effects on not only the
environment but the
economy as well.
The El Nino that
is currently affecting the
world's weather condi
tions is one and a half
times the size of the
United States, and is still

growing.
However, knowing that El
Nino could have a severe effect on
certain areas, it allows govern
ments and individuals to plan far
the weather changes. Having this
information can save millions of
dollars in repairs for certain geo
graphical areas.
G.E.C.O. Meets every
Thursday at 7 p.m. in the base
ment of Plank gym. Everyone is
welcome!!!

Dear Casey...

Dear Casey,
A few weekends ago, I
was at a party and ended up
getting pretty drunk. I had
come with a bunch of friends,
but in the morning, I woke up
on the floor of this strange
place instead of in my own
bed. My friends had ditched
me there after I had passed
out. I was lucky that nothing
happened, but I can't believe
that my friends totally ditched
me, leaving me in a potentially
dangerous situation. They

don't seem to think that this
is a big deal, but I feel betrayed
and angry. I think that is only
fair. What do you think?
Thanks,
Upset
Dear Upset,
Well, did your friends force
you to drink or get completely
wasted? Probably not. When you
drink you should realize that YOU
are putting yourself in a potentially
dangerous situation to begin with,
especially if all the friends with you
are getting drunk as well.

Now, the fact that your
friends ditched you is rather disturb
ing. They should have seen what
you are doing, and stuck around to
make sure you got out okay.
It seems that we often depend
upon our friends to take care of us
when we are drinking; we put an
awful lot of responsibility on their
shoulders.
This leads me to surmise that
the problem does not lie solely in
the hands of your friends. I sup pose
that if they were sober they would
not have left you. But, when alco
hol is involved, fears, worries, and
concerns are usually left behind in
an empty bottle.
No, I would not completely
blame your friends, or yourself.
Instead, I would blame the lack of
education on alcohol awareness.
People either do not know, or do not
care. Efforts are being made to in
crease awareness, and I would sug
gest that you get involved and help
to spread the word.

Dear Casey,
I have a problem. One oi
my friends has been skipping
a lot of classes. He seems to
do his work, but he just never
seems to make it to class. I
am beginning to worry, but I
do not want to be his mother
and nag him. I have to do
something, but what?
Thanks,
Worried
Dear Worried,
I think that often people do
not tend to realize how important it
is to go to class. When someone
gets into the habit of not going to
class, it is like the potato chip syn
drome-you know, you can never
have just one. The same pertains to
class attendance, or lack thereof.
After all, is there nothing sweeter
than sleeping in until one or two
o'clock on a weekday? Yes, a high
GPA.

I do understand your fear of
the "mother syndrome," which
seems to be a popular trend in col
lege. This can be good and bad. It
is good because it lets people know
that someone cares, but it is bad
because isn't the reason we came to
college to get away from our moth
ers? The last thing we want is to
be nagged. Something you can do
for your friend is encourage him to
go to class, and whatever you do,
don't enable him.
Be a friend and mention your
concern without being pushy. Just
say, "Look buddy, I am concerned
about you, but in the long run, you
are the only one that is going to be
hurt." And it is true, he is.
However, some people are
stubborn, and he might just not lis
ten to you. If this happens, don't
be offended.

You are right: you can't be his
mother, and you can't ground him,
send him to his room, or more im
portantly, send him to class.

Conflict and Consensus —
From The Donkey's Mouth
On Being A Democrat

byLibbyMain
Contributing Writer
The other contributors to this
column and the writer of its Re
publican antithesis have chosen to
discuss issues of national political
importance. They have avoided
discussion that is first person in na
ture, but I really wasn't comfort
able scanning the papers for the
newest political scandal or trying
to understand the difference be
tween the latest Republican and
Democratic plans for campaign fi
nance reform. Belonging to a po
litical party isn't just about identi
fying with party leaders or issues
on a national or abstract level. I
feel that it is beneficial to think
about political issues on a more
personal basis and I hope that some
people will be able to identify with

me. I, for example, could not
visit the extremely impoverished

area of Sandtown-Winchester in
Baltimore without developing the
belief that the government needs
to do something about economic
and psychological poverty. Could
you walk through the abandoned
houses filled with garbage that in
cludes dirty needles, filthy play
pens and moth eaten clothing
crawling with bugs and feel that
public housing was adequate? If
you were given a tour of the com
munity center and were able to
meet people who benefitted from
improvements provided by Federal
Empowerment Zone status would
you think they didn't deserve wel
fare? If you knew that there was
a decrease in the high school drop
out rate as a result of a tutoring
program, a decrease in the teen
pregnancy rate as a result of coun
seling efforts, and increased com
munity involvement and civic
pride in the neighborhood as a re
sult of the comprehensiveness of

the services provided could you be
indifferent. Would you want Con
gress to take money away from
them? In addition, would you per
sonally want to witness the execu
tion by lethal injection of a person
who vehemently professed their
innocence through countless ap
peals and interrogations?
What would you do if a
member of your family was in a
devastating car accident which left
them in a vegetative, brain dead
state for more than four months?
If the doctors prognosis was for no
recovery _, your family was grow
ing increasingly upset and drained
from seeing the relative hooked
up to respirators and heart moni
tors day after day, and the finan
cial cost of the care was becoming
unbearable would you still respect
the Supreme Courts ruling against
active voluntary euthanasia?
How would you feel if you

were completely qualified and able
to do a job but you could not be
hired because you are wheelchair
bound and the company's office
building has not conformed to fed
eral accessibility standards leaving
you unable even to enter the build
ing? Would you appreciate the
current right to procure an abor
tion if one of your good friends
from High School was violently
raped? In response to Republicans
who would say that these are
highly emotional examples of the
individual effects political issues,
these cases do exist whether or not
they are in the minority. We must
realize that every government de
cision no matter how minor its
seems has moral, social, economic,
and personal repercussions. In
addition, Republicans would argue
that people should take care of
themselves and one another and

leave the government out of these
issues. However, the government
has a responsibility to protect the
liberties of all citizens and is able
to provide more funding and uni
versal enforcement for implement
ing policies.
A final note-don't be de
pressed or upset about the situa
tions I have described! Act on
them! Go to Sandtown-Winches
ter with the Center for Public Ser
vice, protest the death pena 'lty,
write a living will, make sure the
buildings in your town are handi
capped accessible, or join the Na
tional Organization of Women here
on campus! Democrats tend to
take a more optimistic approach
towards change and political ac
tion than their Republican coun
terparts but I realize you don't have
to be a Democrat to have a social
conscience; you just have more
sympathetic company within your
party if you are.

The Pachyderm's Pulpit
Race and the Republican Party

byJohnDunlap
StaffWriter Not Since before the New
Deal have Republicans been able
to maintain control of the Con
gress for more than one term.
Just by holding on to power on
Capitol Hill, republicans showed
that 1994 was not a fluke, that
there was and is some type of re
alignment occurring on the
American political map. Repub
licans however, hold a tentative
control of the House of Represen
tatives as they did lose seats in
last year's election. Speaker of
the House Gingrich's majority is
very thin, as some moderate Re
publicans got the boot last No
vember.
Republicans controlling
the Congress is no easy thing,
considering the GOP can not even
compete in virtually every minor
ity district in America. African-

Americans vote Democratic in
overwhelming numbers, and while
GOP support grows in many sec
tors, Hispanics who were divided
over President Ronald Reagan in
1984 voted solidly against the Re
publican Nominee for President
last year, former Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole. While the Re
publican stance on immigration
and affirmative action played well
in GOP constituencies it hurt the
Republican ticket from President
on down when it came to expand
ing the party.
President Clinton's slogans
on issues like affirmative action,
such as "Mend it but do not bend
it," were able to attract white sub
urban voters while holding on to
the Democrats base of minorities.
I am not saying that the Republi
can stance on race related issues
is wrong or that Republicans
should ride the fence like our yo¬

yo President, all I am saying is that
Republicans should go into minor
ity neighborhoods and begin a con
versation.
Republicans from the Civil
War to the New Deal were known
as the party who liberated African
Americans from the shackles of
slavery. Reconstruction created a
new type of slavery and fear of
Democrats kept Blacks voting Re
publican. In 1924, the Democratic
National Convention lasted over
two weeks because Democrats
were fighting over criticisms of the
Klu Klux Klan. No matter what
Republicans did they had voters of
color in their pocket.
President Franklin
Roosevelt changed that and he cre
ated a Democrat majority in
America made up of a great coali
tion of labor unions, southern
whites, the poor, and minorities.
Liberals bravely led the charge for

the Civil Rights movements in the
sixties and by 1968 Republicans
could not even compete for minori
ties. The Reagan Revolution
passed over black communities
despite rising standards of living
among African-Americans. Presi
dent George Bush tried to reach
out but things like Willie Horton
kept him from sounding sincere.
President Clinton, on the
other side of the political aisle has
remained popular among a broad
range of minorities, but not be
cause of things which he has done.
For instance, under his administra
tion affirmative action is dying, he
signed the Republican Welfare re
form Bill, which was bitterly op
posed by minority Democrats in
the Congress, and he has moved
the Democratic party rightward. In
doing all of this, he has run con
trary to the wishes of top Black
Democrats like Reverend Jesse

Jackson, who has not had a warm
relationship with the President.
This gives Republicans an
excellent opportunity to talk to
Black voters about their issues and
concerns. Jack Kemp tried to do
that as Bob Dole's running mate
last year but he received little help.
Republicans must talk about how
affirmative action hurts minorities.
In the business I worked at over the
summer my boss was a young
black woman, at first, I wondered
is she had gotten her position be
cause of race or gender prefer
ences. You know what, I came to
soon discover that she was an in
telligent, highly competent leader
who could get things done. She
earned the respect of everyone
working beneath her, white, black
and Asian. I know I was not alone
see PACHYDERM, pg. 11


Racism Does Exist...

in my thinking, and it cheapened
what she had accomplished be
cause of government programs that
are supposed to help.
Racial quotas pit people
against one another and
demagogue's excuses for why
white people lose jobs. When quo
tas were enacted under the Nixon
Administration by the National
Civil Rights Commission they
were a noble idea but they have
failed, they are in my opinion, un
constitutional and unfair. They
have lost their, under our current
system racial preferences would
benefit Eddie Murphy above a
poor white man in Adams County.
That is not right. Today everyone
fits into a quota except white males
and when you single one group out
like that it only encourages hate
and racism. Reverend Martin
Luther King, Jr. and Vice President
Hubert Humprey did not fight for
quotas, they battled for a color
blind society and that should be our
goal as a nation.

publicans must talk about how they
are for school choice and vouch
ers, which help the poor, and in
ner-city children. No child should
be should be stuck in a bad school
and the GOP attempt to give
vouchers to District of Columbia
residents does not help country
club Republicans from suburban
New Jersey, it helps the poor black
child who is afraid to go to school
in urban D.C.
Republican candidates for
office must go into the cities and
talk about how Mayor Guilliani's

way of fighting crime, not the lib
eral way used by his failed prede
cessor David Dinkins has worked.
The Republican way should be
tried all across America. In Wash
ington, Mayor Marion Barry has
hopped onto the Republican band
wagon endorsing voluntary school
prayer and the death penalty. The
old way of government checks
does not work in today's society.
Racism does exist; the Los
Angeles riots and the Simpson
Trial showed that. Resentment and
hate are out there and a true con
servative should stand up for all

individuals, minorities, women,
and homosexuals all included.
Not for preferential treatment but
for equal right. It has only been
thirty years since African-Ameri
cans were given by law their true
equal rights with the Civil Rights
Act and the Voting Rights Act.
Hate and discrimination will al
ways exist, but a true two-party
debate among minorities can
open a lot of minds on all sides.
In 1994, Ellen Sauerbrey
was defeated for Governor of
Maryland by about two-tenths of

one percent. She ignored 25% of
the state, the African-Americans
because she felt there was no way
of winning them over and she
only received 7% of their support.
Mrs. Sauerbrey is campaigning
again for Maryland's top office,
and this time she is talking to
black voters, and while most are
not joining her on her campaign,
they are listening. When you look
around urban Baltimore, Phila
delphia, or Washington then it is
obvious that the old liberal way
of governing America's cities just
does not work.

Consider this

This week Gettysburg
College's sidewalks were covered
with the names of various histori
cal, literary, and pop-culture fig
ures. These names were written in
preparation for National Coming
Out Day this week.
Many questions are raised
by the presence of these names.
Are all of these figures homo- or
bisexual? Or did they only sup
port the right to an alternative
lifestyle?
Should the names of former
first ladies, great authors, and tal
ented artists be labeled in such an
ambiguous manner?
While many of the names
chalked on sidewalks throughout
campus represent openly homo
sexual or bisexual figures, the
sexual orientation of many is only
based upon speculation, conjec
ture, and rumor.
But while the homosexual¬

ity or bisexuahty of these iconic
figures of our past and present may
be questionable, the motivation
behind the chalkings is not.
The objective behind the
sidewalk writings was to show the
campus community that alternative
sexual lifestyles are neither a new
phenomenon nor the life choice of
an isolated minority.
Far too often, homosexuals
and bisexuals are portrayed in our
culture as people who do not fit in
or do not have a place within main¬

stream society.
But as the names chalked on
the walks tiiis week attest, gays,
lesbians, and bisexuals number
among the greatest that human so
ciety has had to offer throughout
the history ofthe world.
Try to imagine American lit
erature without the contributions of
Walt Whitman or Herman
Melville. Or American political
history without Alexander
Hamilton or Elanor Roosevelt. Or
the renaissance without Leonardo
DiVinci.
Together, the people repre
sented by the names chalked
throughout campus form a piece of
human history so substantial that
history is unfathomable and inco
herent without them.
Those who wrote the names
of these figures across the campus
have provided an invaluable ser
vice to the Gettysburg College
community.

The students, faculty, and
administration of the College are
frequently in need cf a wake-up
call. In this seemingly homoge
neous campus, it is far too easy to
assume that homosexuals and bi
sexuals are an insignificant and
negligible part ofthe community.
The names on the sidewalks
make us question our assumptions
and realize that sexual minorities
are a valuable part of our cultural
history and important people in our
own lives.

Conflict and Consensus

An Open Letter to the Campus

Thank you to all the volunteers who helped make the
Fiesta a tiemendous success again this year Your lifting
cooking, serving, playing, patrolling and celebrating
contributed to joy for literally thousands of others.
Without your hard work an essential part of our
relationship with the community that surrounds us could
not have taken place. We hope the hard work and its

significance was rewarding for you

Howard
Public Relations Chair Panhel and
IFC If you missed any of the ac
tion this past week, here is a recap
of all of the events from Greek
Week, and the winners of each

event. On Saturday, the entire
Greek system pulled together and
participated in the annual Greek
GIV day. There were over 120
men and women present represent
ing the Gettysburg's Greek system
participating in community service
all over town. On Sunday the
Scavenger Hunt made its official
return to Greek Week with a huge
success. There were Greeks all
over campus searching frantically
for objects as random as an Illinois
drivers license to #97 at Pizza
House. For the women, Chi
Omega finished first, Alpha Delta
Pi finished second and Delta
Gamma came in third. As for the
men, Sigma Nu came in first, Al
pha Chi Rho finished second and
Sigma Alpha Epsilon came in
third.

Bed races was the next event
on the agenda and it was as comi
cal as was expected. Some beds
made it, while most others had
some minor flaws, like falling
apart. Theta Chi won this event
easily with in our opinion the best
bed we have ever seen raced, while
Sigma Nu and Fiji came in second
and third respectively. As for the
women, Delta Gamma came in
first with Chi Omega and Alpha
Delta Pie finishing behind them.
On Tuesday, we enjoyed the
rain shortened Greek Carnival
while it lasted. Booths were set up
by most organizations with themes
like: A-D-Pie in your face, a fiesta
theme, dart game, bobbing for
apples, or a goldfish toss. Sigma
Nu and Gamma Phi Beta came
away with most creative booths
and earned extra points.

Wednesday was the Greek
Olympics competition with four
events comprising the days activi
ties. The dizzy bat race led off the
festivities with the usual laughs,
but Alpha Tau Omega wasn't
laughing as they led the way to first
place, while Sigma Alpha Epsilon
and Fiji followed. For the women,

Chi Omega came in first with
Gamma Phi and Delta Gamma fin
ishing behind them. The egg race
followed and created a little mess
in Stine Lake. The object of this
race was to run across Stine Lake
with an egg balanced on a spoon.
Phi Sigma Kappa managed to win
this event with Alpha Tau Omega
and Theta Chi finishing second and
third. Alpha Delta Pi finished first
while Gamma Phi and Delta
Gamma followed.
Following the egg race, the
three-legged race began. Aside
from a few broken ropes, the race
went well. Fiji came in first with

Crow and Phi Psi following. As
for the women, Delta Gamma won
the race with Chi Omega and
Gamma Phi right behind them.
Finally, the grand finale for the day
was the much anticipated tug-of
war. To say that Alpha Tau Omega
was pumped up for this years com
petition is an understatement.
They ran away with the competi
tion and with the rope, literally.
Phi Psi finished second and Crow
finished third. As for the women,
Alpha Delta Pi pulled their way
into first while Gamma Phi and
Delta Gamma finished in second
and third.

Mud Volleyball was another
awesome day in Greek Week.
Aside from random dives in the
quarry, the event was great. For
the men, Crow came in first, Phi
Sigma Kappa finished second, and
Theta Chi finished in third. Alpha
Delta Pie won the women's tour
nament while Chi Omega and
Gamma Phi followed.
In the week's finale, there
was no surprise that Airbands was
as good as all of the hype that sur
rounded it. Some of the acts per
formed by the fraternities included

a remake of Paul Simon's "You
Can Call Me Al," "Thriller," the
Bosstones and a couple of rap
medleys. The women performed
a couple of American acts, Aqua's
"Barbie Girl," The Little
Mermaid's "Under the Sea," the
Brady Bunch theme song, "Men in
Black" and Bon Jovi's "Shot
Through the Heart." To say that
all of the acts were well rehearsed
may not be completely accurate,
but to say that all of the acts were
extremely entertaining would be
very true.

The Bed Races of Greek Week proved to be fun for all, though the bed races showed little for
the engineering skills at Gettysburg College.

Fiji s performance of "You
Can Call Me Al" easily won first
place, while Crow's rap medley of
Wyclef Jean's "Stayin Alive" and
The Notorious B.I.G.'s "Mo
Money, Mo Problems" finished in
second. Right behind them was
Sigma Nu's rendition of the
Mighty Mighty Bosstones' "The
Impression That I Get."
As for the women, we think
that it is safe to say that Alpha
Delta Pi is always the team to beat,
this year proved to be no different.
Their sophomore sisters finished in
first while their senior sisters ended

up in third with two different acts
concerning an American theme.
Finishing in second place were the
Chi Omega seniors with a great
rendition of the Brady Bunch
theme, and other classic tunes from
the seventies.
The final standings were as
follows. For the men, finishing in
third was Fiji, while Sigma Nu fin
ished in second. For the women,
Delta Gamma came in third and
Chi Omega finished in second.
This years Greek Week champions
were... Alpha Chi Rho and Alpha
Delta Pie. Congratulations on a job

well done.
To all sorority women, the
deadline for scholar of the month
has been extended to next Monday.
This means there is still time to
nominate your worthy sisters. The
winner will receive a gift certifi
cate to K&K Records. Send your
nominations to Liz Hickock at Box
1087 or give them to your
Panhellenic delegate before the
Panhel meeting next Monday.

Twenty centuries (!) later, Euler

Beyond the Bullets
Making the "Moss" of a second chance

BySteveJenJdns
Sports Editor
Phenom. That was the only
word to describe Randy Moss as
a high school athlete. He lettered
eight times, and in his senior year
was named West Virginia's high
school football player of the year
As a junior and senior, he was
named the states' basketball player
of the year. Randy Moss was be
ing recruited by Notre Dame and
many other colleges until an event
that changed his life occured.
Spurned by racial slurs and
other demeaning conduct, Moss
took part in a brawl that saw many
people injured and cost Moss his
shot to play at the "mother of all
football programs" Notre Dame.
Moss was then recruited by
Bobby Bowden and the Seminoles
of Florida State. "He was the most
amazing football player I have
ever seen," said the Seminoles
Bowden. "I gauge everything off
of Deion [Sanders], and this guy
reminds me so much of him."

In 199S, Moss was a red
shirt freshman at FSU. He was not
playing very often, and more
trouble made its way into Moss'
life. After Moss had been hang
ing out with some friends, they de
cided to try some marijuana.
Moss was already on probation
after charges stemming from the
fight at his high school, and when
he was caught for marijuana use,
he was arrested and a hearing was
scheduled.
Randy Moss pleaded guilty
to the charges involving the mari
juana and received 30 days in jail
and a mandatory probation term.
"He suffered a huge disappoint
ment," his lawyer said, "there is
no one to blame but himself. He
knows it. He knows it better than
anybody."

After being kicked off the
Florida State football team, Randy
Moss returned home to West Vir
ginia. He transfered to in-state
Marshall University, and Moss
and Marshall have been like "peas
and carrots" ever since.
The first time that Moss, a
wide receiver, ever caught a pass
for Marshall, he ran 26 yards for
a touchdown. This was only a in¬

kling of what was to come for the
Marshall Thundering Herd and all
of their fans.
In 1996, Randy Moss
caught more regular season touch
down passes than any other fresh
man in NCAA History with 19.
(This was the same number of
touchdowns that Desmond
Howard of Michigan scored when
he was awarded the Heisman Tro
phy.) Moss scored, at least, one
touchdown in every game and
scored a touchdown in the first
quarter of the first nine games of
1996. Moss twice tied the

Marshall single game touchdown
record with four touchdowns
against The Citadel and Montana.
In the first round of the 1996
NCAA playoffs, Moss caught
eight passes for 288 yards versus
the University of Delaware - set
ting a Marshall university, South
ern Conference, and NCAA 1-AA
playoff records for receiving yard
age in a single game. Also against
Delaware, Moss showed that he
was "faster than the speed of light"
as he scored two touchdowns in
less than 70 seconds. Impressive,
to say the least.

At the end of the 1996 sea
son, Moss was named a first team
All-American by all five award
ing organizations: Walter Camp,
Football Gazette, The Sports Net
work, Associated Press, and
American Football Quarterly.
During the 1996 campaign,
he caught 78 passes for 1,709
yards and 28 touchdowns. Moss'
28 touchdown receptions tied the
record for most touchdowns ever
in a single season of NCAA foot
ball. (Some guy named Jerry Rice
had 28 in 1984. Anybody ever
heard of him?)
Here are a few quotes from
some semi-famous organizations
regarding Randy Moss:
"Moss has sport's trump
card: talent. Better, he has the kind
of breath taking athletic gifts seen
once in a generation." -Sports Il
lustrated

"You may never have heard
of Marshall's Randy Moss, but as
the best player in College football,
he will not be a secret for long." -
Los Angeles Times
"The most gifted wide

reciever college football has seen
since Jerry Rice." - Boston Globe.
This season Marshall Uni
versity has moved up to compete
with the big boys in Division 1
football. As a tremendous athlete,
and Marshall's first ever Heisman
trophy candidate, Moss was also
named to a few preseason All
America teams by: Playboy, The
Sporting News, Street and Smith
Football, and Football News. He
was selected by Street and Smith's
as the number one reason to watch
college football, and was rated the
number one reciever in college

football by The Sporting News.
Through only the first few
weeks of this college football sea
son, Randy Moss has already es
tablished himself as a Division 1
player and has put himself in the
running for the most prized award
in Division 1 football: The
Heisman Trophy.
Moss has compiled some
impressive numbers in his sopho
more season. He currently has 38
receptions for 789 yards and 14
touchdowns. No, that is not a ty
pographical error, he hasl4 touch
downs. He has scored 84 points

and is looking to smash all kinds
of records with his 4.2 speed (40
yard dash) and his awesome ath
letic talent.
Randy Moss is an athlete of
a different breed. He has talent,
size, and ability, but one of the
most important things that he has
is luck. Because of a few incidents
Randy Moss almost amounted to
nothing; all that talent was almost
washed away forever. Randy
Moss is receiving a second chance
at Marshall University, and he is
making the most of it.

Rugby Women make debut

As the sun rose over the
majestic landscape of the Gettys
burg Battlefields, new faces ap
peared, those of the Gettysburg
College Women's Rugby Club.
The newest edition to the athlet
ics at Gettysburg took on
Susquehanna University.
The game was intense. The
Bullets defense was tough with

help from flanker Kelly Graham,
who later suffered her first concus
sion (congrats Kelly welcome to
rugby). The Bullets remained
tough throughout the first half de
spite two quick trys by
Susquehanna.
The second half the Bullets
settled down and with good con
ditioning started to take advantage
of the S.U. backs. Jeannie
Albrecht, now of legendary status,
ran wild through the S.U.
backfield. She was slowed by her

pony tail twice as the S.U.
women's team could not seem to
find anything else to grab.
Sarah Calhoun shout down
pack play with her aggressive play
and fullback Courtney Young was
fierce on the attack (see photo be
low). The team played well over
all. They are young and new to
this foreign sport. They have the
athleticism to go far with help
from their coach. Captain Deb

The Bullets soccer team
continued their rampage this past
week with three more victories,
extending their winning streak to
12 games and their overall record
to 12-1. The Lady Bullets now
have the school record of 14 con
secutive wins in their sights. If
they continue at this pace, there
will be no stopping them.
The Bullets opened up Fam
ily Weekend on the road at Ursinus
in another Centennial Conference
match up. The Bullets buried the
Bears, 5-0, to preserve their un
defeated conference record. A
balanced scoring effort was high
lighted by freshman Jill
Piekarski's first career goal.

Also scoring for the Bullets
were Maureen McBrien, Amy
Brewster, Patsy Cors, and Lyndsay
Murphy. Brewster assisted on
both McBrien's and Cors' goals.
Also, goalkeeper Beth O'Boyle
earned her seventh shutout of the

season. In the second half the Bul
lets extended their lead to 2-0
when Paula Connard notched an
unassisted goal. However, Stock
ton tallied a goal when a free kick
deflected off the crossbar and was
headed in by a Stockton front run
ner. Many inexperienced teams
may have lay down and died.
However these Bullets are tougher
and stronger than the "other guys."
The Bullets surged ahead and
added another goal when Lauren

Scott collected Amy Brewster's
shot off the crossbar and placed it
in the back of the net for her sec
ond goal of the season. Stockton
did rebound however, and almost
immediately they rallied against
Scott's goal and pushed the score
to 3-2.
The Bullets suppressed the
late rally by Stockton and once
again came out on top. The tre
mendous team effort on the part
of the Bullets was the key to their
success in this hard fought battle.
Senior Captain and goalkeeper
Beth O'Boyle once again came up
big in leading the Bullets to vic
tory. Last week's overtime win
against Swarthmore, along with
their double win weekend, was
enough to put the Bullets among
the top ten teams in the nation.
This week the Bullets checked in
at number nine in the NCAA Na
tional Poll. The Bullets remain at

However, in yesterday's
battle of the Centennial Confer

sole possession of the conference
lead with a 3-1 victory over West
ern Maryland. This game allowed
Brewster to extend her scoring
streak to 11 consecutive games
with two goals and an assist.
Maureen McBrien assisted
Brewster's second goal while
Patsy Cors assisted the first and
also scored one of her own. This
win pushed the Bullets to 6-0 in

only remaining undefeated team.
Only Haverford_, Dickinson, and
Johns Hopkins stand in their way
of a conference championship.

forth a demanding tone for Gettys
burg amongst the rest of the
region's teams.
In the first half of play, Chris
Pryor scored a goal to jump start
the Getysburg offense. There were
many more shots to come from the
Bullets in the first half, but Pryor's
was the only goal. In the second
half of play, both Jason Vishio and
Jesse Flynn scored a goal.
Now the tempo of the game
was on the Gettysburg side. The
Bullets thwarted all efforts by the
Haverford offense with tough de
fense. Jon Katerba played a great
game at goal as he blocked and
saved every shot by the Haverford
offense. This win by the Gettys
burg men gives them a conference
record of 2-0-1 and an overall
record of 6-3-1.
The next game for the Bul
lets is on October 8 at 4:00 at York
College. Hopefully they will have
the same dominant success they
had at Haverford.

On October 4, at 2:30, the
men's soccer team traveled to
Haverford College to take on the
school. The Gettysburg team
came to the game with a full head
of steam as they swept up the
Haverford squad in an impressive
3-0 bout.
Stars of the game were
Chris Pryor, Jason "Supa' Fly"
Vishio, and Jesse Flynn. The im
pressive play of goal keeper Jon
Katerba led the team to their third
shutout in conference play.
The Gettysburg men dis
played great offensive play as they
outshot their opponents and out
played them. The men's defense
is also credited with a great game
as they shutout their opponents
impressively.
The Haverford squad, at the
time, was ranked fifth in the re
gion while Gettysburg was ranked
fourth in the region. This win set


SPORT SPOTLIGHT
Mr. Gurski's Neighborhood

Kevin Gurski lives life with
a huge smile on his face. The se
nior football player likes to have
fun, and this is evident in all as
pects of his life. All through el
ementary school and the pee-wee
football leagues Kevin begged his
parents to let him play football.
But the answer kept coming back
the same, "No!"
Instead Gurski spent his
younger years playing soccer, a
game which he got pretty good at
and enjoyed playing. In the eighth
grade his parents finally allowed
him to play football and even con
vinced him to go out for the team.
Kevin immediately fell in love
with football.
He played for his junior
high school in Harrisburg during
his eighth and ninth grade years
before graduating onto the high
school. As a sophomore, Kevin
was afraid that he was too small
and too short to play high school
football.

ByCheshaMffler StaffWriter

After much harassing from
the high school coach who had
heard of Gurski's talent, Kevin
made a decision which has af
fected the course of his life since.
Two weeks into the season Gurski
finally hustled out to the football
field for the junior varsity team.
"I was way behind and had
a lot to learn," said Gurski, "but it
was great. I'm really glad that I
did it." Gurski began his career
as a defensive back, and aside
from a brief trial as an offensive
receiver, he has continued to play
in that position.
After being actively re
cruited by Head Coach Barry
Streeter and "falling in love" with
everything about Gettysburg,
Gurski found himself playing
football for the Bullets. "I was
really impressed with Coach
Streeter," explained Kevin, "I have
a lot of respect for the whole
coaching staff. It has been a great
program to be a part of."

As a four year starter at free-safety, Senior Kevin Gurski has been the Bullets main hitman

Gurski has had a very suc
cessful football career at Gettys
burg thus far. Aside from some
time out due to a bout with mono
nucleosis during his freshman
year, Kevin has spent four years
starting for the Bullets. Last year,
as a junior, he was named to the
second team All-Centennial Con
ference, led the team in intercep
tions (five) and had the second
best record for tackles (103).
At the present time Kevin
has made 193 tackles, which he
hopes to improve to 300 tackles
in his career by the end of the sea
son. He is well on his way towards
this, leading the team with 40 tack
les this season.
"I love to compete," said
Kevin, "I get to go one-on-one as
a defensive back and it's great."
Gurski has such a "great time"
playing because he has the right
attitude. It is also really special
for him to be playing with his best
friends.

Since junior high, Kevin
has always found his best friends
to be those that he was playing
football with. "I have the most
respect for the guys I've played
with. It's a lot of fun, especially
with friends," Gurski explained.
"I have really enjoyed playing
with everyone [on the team]," said
Gurski, "I appreciate everyone
playing and having a good time. I
will be really sad to see it all end."
Streeter is very proud of all
that Gurski has accomplished. He
has been a real asset to the Get¬

tysburg football team because of
his leadership qualities, commit
ment, and talent.
"Kevin is a really dedicated
athlete. He's a program kid," said
Streeter, "he does whatever he can
to make it a successful program."
Gurski is really respected by all
of his teammates and coaches for
his dedication and dependability.
"What I like best about Kevin,"
explained Streeter, " is his posi
tive, upbeat attitude. I really en
joy being around him."
Streeter believes that

Off the field Kevin is all smiles, but on the field however, Kevin loves to "bring tf?e lumber"

Gurski's successes have to come
to him because of his work ethic
and positive attitude. "He has the
physical qualities, like good speed
and height, too, but it is his con
stant hard work that makes him the
success that he is," Streeter ex
plains.
Gurski works hard in every
aspect of his life. Kevin spends a
great deal of time, "maybe too
much time," he said, on his school
work. He is always looking to
please himself and his parents.
The management major is
also very involved with his frater¬

nity, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, where
he is the treasurer. Kevin also
works with the Special Olympics
and United Way through SAE. He
hopes to get a job in marketing or
sales after graduation this spring
and would really like to be near a
big city like Washington, DC, Bal
timore, or Philadelphia.
Gurski is a very happy per
son, it is hard to wipe the smile
off of his face, a quality he at
tributes to his mother, Rosemary.
"I really respect both of my par
ents," he said, "My dad taught me
hard work and dedication. My
mom taught me to always turns

bad situations into good. She can
always smile and crack a joke, and
she's a child at heart."
Gurski has gained all of
these excellent qualities from both
of his parents, and he uses them
well. Kevin finds success and hap
piness in his life because he
chooses to look at life in the best
possible light. "I wake up every
morning with a smile on my face,"
he said smiling, of course, "I al
ways try to find the good in any
bad situation-1 just want to have
fun with life!"

Sports Weekly —

Bullets, aimed at Hopkins, miss the mark

ByJoshEyler
Assistant Sports editor
Someone once said that luck
is the meeting of opportunity and
preparation. Well, last Saturday
the Bullets were well prepared to
meet the visiting Blue Jays from
Johns Hopkins, but they seemed to
be missing the opportunities. Per
haps, Lady Luck decided to take a
vacation.
Maybe she just stayed at
home to watch Sports Center. I
don't know. What I do know is that
the Bullets had a very large case
of bad luck. Passes fell short,
passes went long, and, in general,
there were a lot of silly mistakes
that turn the tide on a team that is
playing its heart out.
About luck, guru of football
Chris "Sweet Lou" Lunardi had to
say: "Hey, you win some, you lose
some. I guess somebody didn't
want us to win this one."

The Bullet offense was very
evenly balanced on Saturday, scor
ing six points in the first half and
six in the second. Freshman quar
terback Dennis Flaherty played ex
tremely well in his first collegiate
start. He gained 41 yards on eight
carries and was five for 24 with 50
yards in the passing department.
Sophomore fullback Paul

run. Place kicker Wayne Rumsey
made field goals of 37 and 27
yards, respectively, to keep the
Bullets alive.
Unfortunately, the Blue
Jays' offense was on a roll on Sat
urday. They gained 386 yards on
the ground and scored 17 points
in the first half. However, it is a
tribute to the Bullet defense that
Johns Hopkins only scored a field
goal after halftime. Jason Osborn
was once again named to the Cen
tennial Conference Honor Roll for
a performance in which he made
14 tackles and recovered a fumble.
Behind the mighty Osborn came
the usual tandem of Kevin Gurski,
Chad Mire, and the rest of the Bul
let defense that held tough in the
trenches all day long.

This weekend, the Yellow
Jackets (2-2 in the CC) of
Randolph Macon come to Gettys
burg (1-2 in the CC). About the
upcoming game Derek Reed said,
"They're a good team and we will
have to play up to our capabilities
to beat them." It is only the third
time that the two teams have met
with each team winning on its
home field.
You know what that means.

College sued for
discrimination

pholo by Mark Astrom

by Rebecca Babbitt
Gettysburg College is
being sued by a former profes
sor who was denied tenure.
Kelfala Kallon has filed
a federal discrimination law
suit against the College. The
case is being heard by Judge
Rambo this week at the Fed
eral Court in Harrisburg. An
all white jury will decide the
outcome of the case.
Originally from Sierra
Leon in west Africa, Kallon
was a tenure-track professor
of economics at Gettysburg
from 1987 until the fall semes
ter of 1992 when he was de
nied tenure.
Kallon believes he was
denied tenure because he is
black.

The defence, led by the
college's attorney, Dana
Schadudo, is making a case
that Kallon was denied tenure
because of poor reactions from
students on their end-of-se
mester evaluations—not be
cause of his race.
A number of memos,
emails, and letters has been in
troduced as evidence by the
prosecution. Most of the cur
rent faculty of the economics
department have been called to
testify, including Derrick
Gondwe, Robert Gemmiill,
and Anne Fender.
Fender, Chair of the
Economics department, testi
fied Monday that Kallon
would be a "good addition to
the department and the
school."
In a memo sent by then
Provost, Baird Tipson, he de¬

scribed Kallon s teaching meth
ods as causing "anxiety, insecu
rity and even antagonism" in his
students. Tipson based his re
marks on comments by students
given in their evaluations.
Other memos and letters
stated that Kallon "needs to
soften his image," and the some
students dislike his style."
Despite the reviews made
by students, Kallon was unani
mously recommended for ten
ure by the Economics depart
ment faculty. His tenure fol
lowed the usual path and was
reviewed by the Faculty and
Personnel Committee (FPC).
The FPC also approved Kallon
for tenure. The final stepin ten
ure approval comes from the
President, and Haaland denied
Kallon's tenure.

Charles "Buzz" Myers
was called to the stand Tuesday.
Myers was also up for tenure
review in 1991. Myers filed a
grievance after his tenure was
denied. Shortly after he was
denied a permanent place on the
Religion department faculty,
the publishers of a scholarly
journal, Novmn Testimentum,
agreed to publish one of his ar
ticles. After conferring with
President Gordon Haaland,
Myers withdrew his grievance
and his tenure case was re
viewed by Haaland. Myers was
finally granted tenure in 1992.
Haaland will most likely
testify before the trial is fin
ished. The defense plans to rest
its case on Friday.

99 students killed by Bacchus

byDanLarkin
News Editor ,
This past week, the Gettys
burg College chapter of Bacchus
joined many other organizations
nationwide in observing Alcohol
Awareness Week.
The week's events provided
opportunities for students to hear
presentations, reflect with each
other on the impact of alcohol on
their lives, and promote a commit
ment to responsible drinking.
Bacchus is not a
prohibistionist organization, but
stresses contrloled, responsible
consumption of alcohol.
Perhaps the most visible
sign of Alcohol Awareness week

on the Gettysburg Campus came yes
terday, when Bacchus "killed"
ninety-nine students for "White Face
Day." The White Face Day program
was coordinated by sophomore
Kristen Fisher.
Between 8 am and 6 pm,
about ten students every ten minutes
donned white face paint and black
clothing. These studetnts refrained
from talking to others on campus and
wore signs explaining their "deaths.".
Programs like White Face Day
are put on by SADD and Bacchus
groups across the country to spread
a message about responsible usie of
alcohol.
This was done to symbolize
the death of a person every seven
minutes in alcohol related accidents.

According to Bacchus Pro
gramming Chair Matt Bange, "the
purpose of the white face was to
show what it would be like if these
people really were dead, and not
present on campus."
The "dead" students were
"resurrected" following a candle
light vigil that started in the College
Union Building and continued out
side to Plank Gym.
Aspeach was given on alco
hol awareness, and the "dead" stu
dents returned to the world of the liv
ing. Bange said that the recent al
cohol-related death of a Massachu
setts Institute of Technology student
has increased awareness and dem
onstrated a need for increased aware
ness.

Bange stated that he felt "al
cohol awareness has increased in
the student population [at Gettys
burg]." He said "If any good has
happened, it is because the students
are becoming more aware."
In conjunction with Alcohol
Awareness Week, Jean Kilborne an
internationally recognized spokes
person on the effects of alcohol and
tobacco advertising and a former
advisor to the US Surgeon General,
will speak at the Common Hour
today. Kilbourne's presentation,
titled "Deadly Persuasion," will be
held at 11:30 am in the College
Union Ballroom.



Sigma Nu battles College

Fraternity, College at odds over

computer _networking
by Henry Fawell r
Staff Writer rc
In recent weeks, the Sigma c
Nu fraternity has challenged the a
legitimacy of Gettysburg *
College's plan for computer net- c
working within all fraternity a
houses.
While the plan covers sev- _^ ga

eral other aspects of house main
tenance, the glaring point, ac
cording to the fraternity, has been
the price of the plan and the net
working system. The brother
hood and House Corporation, a
company from which the frater
nity rents their house, have both
deemed the price totally unfit.
The plan provides all fra
ternities with regular house main
tenance, cleaning and, among
other things, access and mainte
nance to the computer network
ing system. The fee is five thou
sand dollars and is the same for
each fraternity. Sigma Nu is the
only fraternity on campus that has
not signed on with the plan.
Therefore, as Dean Murphy put
it, "Sigma Nu is now the only
non-member of the school".

Corey Ehrenworth, Vice

that in accordance with the plan,
"we would be giving a whole lot
more money towards the school
than we could possibly hope to
receive in return."
House Corporation has
shown it's support for the stance
by refusing to sign on with the
college's plan until proper modi
fications are made to it.
Since Sigma Nu's refusal
of the plan, Gettysburg College
has taken a new course of action.
The college now intends to elimi-

nate from the house the dial-in tone
used by the brothers to check e
mail. Furthermore, it has also _pul
off a plan to install a cyber-optic
cable within the house, which was
apparently only a week or so away
from completion. The college will
continue the installation only when
deal has been signed.
According to the
Ehrenworth, the school is exercis
ing these methods as blackmail
against the fraternity and, in par
ticular, House Corporation.
The conflict has caused so

much discontent among members
of both parties, that a number of
people refused to comment on the
situation.
Thus far, the College has of
fered Sigma Nu one alternative to
its plan. The school has proposed
to place the fraternity on an ac
count with Lan.com company for
a fee of $ 15 per month, per mem
ber of the house. However, the
brotherhood has stated that this
plan rivals the illegitimacy of the
one prior to it. Dean Murphy knew
nothing of the proposed plan with

Lan.com.
l_^aii.cuin.
As of this past Sunday,
Sigma Nu had not been in contact
with the National Office, but was
planning to be shortly. The frater
nity has, however, offered the
school a plan believed to be more
reasonable.
This plan was recently sent
to the administration for voting,
but that has not yet taken place.
Dean Murphy hopes the situation
is resolved quickly, but as he stated
Monday, "we certainly think that
the [college's] plan is worth five
thousand dollars".

College offers young alumni chance to participate

from staff reports
The Gettysburg Department
of Annual Giving has created a va
riety of programs to encourage the
participation of Gettysburg's
younger alumni in College events.
At Gettysburg, young
alumni, members of classes gradu
ating within the past decade have
traditionally had the weakest
showing in support of the
College's Annual Fund.
-Two major programs that
the College has created to help in
crease the percentage of younger
alumni in College events after
graduation are the Cupola Society
Associates Program and the Com
mittee for Young Alumni.
The Cupola Society Associ
ates Program was created in 1996
by the Gettysburg College Board
of Trustees "to recognize and pro
mote leadership giving by the
College's most recent graduates."
Previously," membership in
the College's Cupola Society was
offered only to alumni who gave

$1,250 or more to the Annual
Fund each year.
The Associates program
grants Cupola Society Member
ship to graduates of the last ten
year who contribute $ 100 for each
year since their graduation.
According to Cathy Norris
('90), head of the Committee for
Young Alumni, the Cupola Asso
ciates Program "offers recent
graduates the benefit of network
ing with elite members of the
Gettysburg alumni."
Last year's introduction of
the Associates program, brought
more than 50 new members to the
Cupola Society, and 17 percent
increase in Annual Fund support
from that target group.

Dream a little dream...

by Melodie Foster
St aff Writer
We all have them, we all
want them, but what do we do with
them? Yes, I'm talking about
dreams, those sometimes pleasant,
sometimes demented, images that
haunt your mind while you sleep.
Studies have shown that every per
son has approximately four
dreams each night, though most
are not remembered in the morn
ing. Why do humans dream?
There are several scientific an
swers to that question which have
developed over the last hundred

years or so, but dreams have been
around much longer than that.
In the very first book of the
Bible, dreams are interpreted as
warnings and hidden messages
from God. In Genesis 40, Joseph
has a dream which tells him to flee
to Egypt, where he is imprisoned.
It is his ability lo interpret dreams
that frees him from prison, and he
discloses the meaning of the
Pharaoh's dream about seven fat
and seven thin cows to be a fore
shadowing of the impending seven
years of feast followed by seven
years of famine, a prophesy which
comes true.

It is also told in Mark 2:13
that Joseph had a dream which
told him to take Mary and the baby
Jesus and (lee to Egypt. It was
through his heeding of the dream,
interpreted as a message from
God, that Jesus survived his child
hood. Charlotte Bronte's famous
book Jane Eyre contains two
scenes in which Jane dreams of an
infant, once a week before she re
ceives news that the aunt who
raised her is dying, and once be
fore she discovers she cannot
marry her true love. The appear
ance of a child in a dream was a
symbol commonly accepted at the
time as a warning against impend
ing doom for oneself or one's kin.
Abraham Lincoln and his
wife, Mary Todd, both experi
enced dreams which foretold his
assassination months ahead of
time. Lincoln, during the open¬

ing weeks of his second term,
dreamt of awakening in the
night and seeing his face in the
mirror reflected once normally
and a second time disfigured, as
though in death. His wife cor
rectly took this as a sign that he
would not finish his second

term. Lincoln also once had a
dream while he was in the
White House. He
wandered ^^ _rf
around the build- _* _^ M
ing, and discov- m
ered it was in\ 3
mourning. He /
entered a certain /
room and saw a / _^^^
casket there. B_^ ^^^
Lincoln then
asked a mourner
standing near him who
had died. The mourner looked
at him and said. "The Presi-

Though the dream
as a warning was, and
still is a popular ex
planation for the im
ages one experiences j_>_a_
during sleep, science has _a|A
come up with a different_^_Mj
answer. In the early half oi_^_B
the twentieth century
Sigmund Freud developed a
philosophy which showed
dream as the manifestations of
the mind.
In sleep, when not held in
check by consciousness, the
mind could wander down roads
it passed during the day, but had
not been permitted to travel.
Thus, he said, the various situ
ations and people in one's
dreams could be traced back to
conversations had, places vis
ited, people discussed in pass
ing during the day.

Freud was also well
known for his theories on
sexual symbolism in dreams
and dreams as outlets for sub
conscious desires.
Modern science has pre
sented the world with an even
more concrete reason .why
people dream. When a person

is sleeping, many of the func
tions performed by their body
and brain are put on a suspended
mode. It has been found that cer
tain neurons in the brain, when
left unused for longperiods of
time, cease to function at all, and
dreams may simply be a sort of
screen saver that allows them to
be suspended 1 but still perform

some sort of function.
Another theory says that
the brain is constantly cycling
through images; in the daytime,
these are found in the form of
thoughts, and we tend to have a
bit of control over them. At
night, however, they are strung
together in the sometimes in
comprehensible form of dreams
due to the fact that we are not
awake to control their direction.
Some think that people are
constantly dreaming. This
would be possible because the
process of dreaming is function
ing in our subconscious mind,
and out of view. They may not
be defined as dreams technically,
but the activity is closely related.
However, during certain
cycles of sleep, we can view
these dreams with our con¬

science mind and record them in our tory, which leads one to question
memory (which is why we sometimes their credibility. , _,
we remember them). , According to one source, the
Confused? Try to imagine this: steps to analyzing your dreams are:

your brain, mind, and spirit, while at
rest, "review" and analyze in their
own way your long-term, short-term,
and spirit memory.
It has in its background the
trends of your life and philosophy ,to
influence, it. Your mind is also pro
cessing spiritual data, your be
liefs, whether or not you have
^^V violated them, your infor
\ mation gained through

psychic intuition
(which we all al
legedly have, to
_^^ a certain de
H| gree), and, of
_^B course, any
_^1 communica
W tion from God.
_^ All of this
data, as well as
your subcon
scious "reading
between the lines"
of what people do
and tell you, is then
processed unsuper
vised by you. All this
data is a form of
chaos, and your mind
puts it all together in a

_*_vr form ol visual screen¬
play: a medley of sight, sound, emo
tion, and imagined interactivity. This
is a dream.
Dreams are easily influenced
by factors in your life and spirit, and
these influences create categories that
are almost infinite. We broadly cat
egorize them in terms like "prophetic,
standard, physical, and nightmare" (to
name a few). And these we study each
on their own, in order to gain benefit
from them.
What do dreams mean? Well,
it all depends on what you believe.
Many people, in spite of the scientific
solution, are convinced that their
dreams are messages from their sub
conscious or from a higher power.
Thousands of books have been
written on the subject, including dic
tionaries of objects found in dreams
and their meanings These .sources
are fun to use, but can be contradic-

1. Identify the main concept
or theme of the dream.
2. Match the concept or
theme to a specific area of your life.
3. Get one _jof those
dictionaires (or one on.the Internet)
and figure out what _everything ba
sically means.
4. Take note of the first thing
that catches your attention.
5. List what everything
means to you.
Even so, dream interpreta
tion has long been a means to'un
derstanding oneself and one's life,
but it requires the memory of a

dream. This can be difficult, as
dreams fade away if they are not
immediately thought about upon
awakening. Many people keep
dream diaries, and find them help
ful not only for dream interpreta
tion, but also interesting in general.
Sophomore Laura Fairbairn
had to keep a journal for two weeks
for a Psychology class, and says,
"it was really interesting. Even
though I thought I didn't dream
very much due to sleep deprivation,
when I would write things down
first thing in the morning, I found
that I did in fact dieam."

Dreams have fascinated
people throughout time, leading to
some beautiful thoughts from some
of the greatest people in history.
"The soul in sleep gives
proof of its divine nature," said
Cicero.
"Why does the eye see a
thing more clearly in dreams than
the imagination when awake?"
asked Leonardo da Vinci.
There are no concrete an
swers to what dreams mean, or
even to the question of why people
dream. The fact that even in this
modern age where science is so
prevalent, many people still follow

Alpha Lambda Delta welcomes 50 new members

by Josh Eyler
Alpha Lambda Delta Editor
On Saturday, October 4 at
4 p.m., Alpha Lambda Delta, the
national society honoring a
student's academic achievement
in the first year of college, held
its initiation ceremony for new
members in the Luella
Musselman Paul Recital Hall of
Schmucker Memorial Hall.
To qualify for Alpha
Lambda Delta, these students
achieved a GPA of 3.5 or above
on a 4.0 scale. The new initiates
are now part of an organization
that has 217 chapters nationwide,
and in which more than 500,000
students have been initiated.
Alpha Lambda Delta was
founded in 1924 as an honorary
for freshmen women at the Uni¬

versity of Illinois.
The goal of the honor soci
ety are to promote academic ex
cellence and meaningful realiza
tion of the goals of the young men
and women of today.
The three advisors for
Gettysburg's chapter of Alpha
Lambda Delta, Dr. Robert C.
Nordvall, Dean of First Year Stu
dents, Amanda Rupert Strong, Pro
fessor of Religion, and Dr. Carey
Moore, ran the initiation cer
emony, along with outgoing Presi
dent Carrie R. Williams.
The honor society puts on
two events per semester. In the
fall, professors can honor fresh
men who are doing outstanding
work. These students get to have
dessert on the faculty side of the
Dining Hall and are served by

members of the society.
The fall is also when the
new members are inducted.
In the spring, the executive
board serves a dinner for freshmen
was have a GPA of 3.5 or above.
Last year's group did some
thing above and beyond this. They
had a program called "Caught
Studying." Members of the soci
ety would walk through the fresh
men dorms looking for open
doors. If the people in the rooms
were studying, the society would
give them candy.
Fifty members of the class
of 2000 became members of the
honor society.
The 1997 initiates of Alpha
Lambda Delta are Mary-Margaret
A. Ammerman, Ann Marie Bielli,
Sabrina L. Bosse, Christopher T.

Bowman, T. Pemberton Brown,
Matthew B. Brown, Renata F.
Coutinho, Carol A. Dancy,

Return to a different Oz

by Glen Beck
Staff Writer Somewhere over the rain
bow there is a sequel to the Wiz
ard ofOz. Actually, it's not over
the rainbow, but at any local video
rental store.
Now I know that that's a
cheesy opener for a review, but I
feel that it is very appropriate for
director Walter Murch's 1985 fol
low-up to the Wizard of Oz, en
titled Return to Oz.
The film starts with Dor
othy back at home in Kansas, not
being able to stop thinking about
Oz. On the farm, she finds a key
which she believes to have been
sent to her by her friends over the
rainbow. Auntie Em, worried for
Dorothy's mental health, takes her
to a doctor famous for working
with electric shock treatment.

In Case You Missed It

Afraid of the therapy, Dor
othy runs away, and she and
Ballina (a farm chicken) mysteri¬

ously find themselves in Oz. There
Dorothy finds the Yellow Brick
Road in pieces and a vacant Em
erald City in ruins. She discovers
that everyone has been trans
formed to stone by the Nome King
and the evil witch, Mombie.
It's now up to Dorothy,
Ballina, and their new friends Tik
Tok, Jack Pumpkinhead, and
Gump to defeat Mombie and the
Nome King, find the missing
Scarecrow, and get Oz back to nor
mal. This journey includes once
again being locked in a room in a
castle and having to choose friends
from a group of decorated boxes.
The film has better special
effects that the original film, but
remember that a lot has changed
in 46 years. In fact, Return to Oz
received an Academy Award nomi
nation for Best Effects (Visual).

As I watched, I just couldn't
get used to the different depictions

of the characters. Fairuza Balk (of
Craft fame) plays Dorothy. Judy
Garland was much older when she
portrayed the lead, so seeing a
younger girl playing the role just
bothered me.
The Scarecrow, the Tinman,
and the Lion are very exaggerated.
Where are Ray Bolger and Bert
Lahr when you want them?
And you're certainly not in
Kansas when you watch this film.
The director incorporates many
more expressionistic elements-

some that even make the film ter
rifying for younger kids (whom
the original film was meant for).
The new characters are all
very entertaining. My favorite is
the naive Jack Pumpkinhead. Ev
ery couple of minutes you'll find
yourself laughing at the this talk
ing pile of sticks with a big jack
o-lantern as a head.
The others, Tik-Tok (a ro
botic man) and Gump (a sofa with
a moosehead on the end), are also
quite amusing.

The screenplay is based on
the next of the books in the Oz se
ries (which is twelve books long)
by L. Frank Baum. These books
focus on Dorothy's many adven
tures in Oz, which are not just a
dream, as the Wizard of Oz im
plies. If you haven't already seen
this sequel, you should rent it. If
you have already, well, let's just
say that I don't think this is a
movie you can watch over and
over.

Side by side

by Cara Masucci
Contributing Writer
We all learned the lesson
when we were young: you have
to share. This is a concept that two
of the new English professors, Fred
Leebron and Kathleen Rhett, have
taken to heart. This husband-and
wife team share almost everything,
from their job to their car. It seems
the only thing they do not share is
their dresser!
This past spring the English
Department was looking to expand
its writing program. A position
opened up that called for one pro
fessor to teach both the fiction and
non-fiction writing courses. To
gether, Professor Leebron and Pro
fessor Rhett applied for the same
position.
Their idea was to split up the
position between themselves in re
gards to their disciplines. Leebron,
the fiction lover, would teach the
fiction courses while Rhett, an avid
non-fiction fan, would handle the
courses in that domain. But this is

not the first time the two profes
sors have decided to work together.
It's an almost story-like
meeting. Twelve years ago on the
first day of orientation at John's
Hopkins Graduate School, Rhett
and Leebron met. They have been
together ever since.
Rhett had already done her
undergraduate work at John's
Hopkins, and decided that after
working with two very well-known
writers, Stanley Fish and David St.
John, that she wanted to continue
her education there. Speaking
about St. John, she said that he was
"a teacher [who] made the differ
ence." Writing and teaching were
things that she had always known
she had wanted to do.

Two English professors mix personal and professional

Leebron,
on the other
hand, was con
vinced he would
have to go to
law school. Af
ter studying in
the Woodrow
Wilson School
at Princeton, he
decided to pur
sue a creative
writing career at
John's Hopkins.
Creative

writing had al
ways been
Leebron's "first
passion," but he
had always
thought it would
be something he
would do on the
side of law, or
medicine.
When the op
portunity came
along to go to
John's Hopkins,
he took it.

After re
ceiving their
Masters at
John's Hopkins,

ships there, as Professors Leebron and Rhett relax at home after a busy day
well as at many of teaching.

other places around the world.
These have allowed them to
travel to places like Thailand,
France, Mexico, Guatemala, not
to mention a half-dozen cities
within the United States. This
has been a great experience for
them, and has allowed them to
become quickly acclimated to

Gettysburg.
When asked what they
thought about Gettysburg, the two
professors were very enthusiastic.
Having each grown up in eastern
Pennsylvania, they like the prox
imity to their relatives, particularly
since they have two small children.
They insist that all their free time

goes to Kate
and Jacob.
They have gone
to the Apple
Festival and
toured the
battlefields with
their two chil
dren. They
both insist that
the Gettysburg
community is
"friendly, cre
ative, and ener
getic." In fact,
one of the major
reasons they de
cided to apply
here was their
respect for The
Gettysburg Re
view. Leebron
continued,
"There is a
good feeling of
dynamism in
Gettysburg."

The stu
dents interest
them, and the
faculty at the
college has
been great. The
only things they
would change
are the lack of
Thai food and

the lack of squash courts in the
area, two of their passions. Other
than that, they are entirely thrilled
with Gettysburg.
The conversation quickly
turned to their courses, and what
their positions entail. When asked
what it is like to share the same
position, they both laughed. "We

disagree," they both blurted.
However, it is a nice balance and
they make each other a better
writer and teacher. It is also a
good idea for them to teach under
different disciplines.
This semester Leebron is
teaching Introduction to Fiction
Writing and English Composition.
Rhett is handling the non_^fiction
domain with Forms of Creative
Non-Fiction. Next semester Rhett
will be teaching two non-fiction
courses while Leebron will teach
one fiction.
This led to the discussion of
what each of them has done in
their discipline so far. Leebron has
edited Post-Modern American
Fiction: ANorton Anthology, and
has written Creative Fiction: A
Writer's Companion, as well as
Out West.
Rhett has written Survival
Stories (Memory of a Crisis), and
Near Breathing (A Memoir of a
Difficult Birth).

In the upcoming months,
they hope to complete a couple
projects they are working on, as
well as spending more time with
their children. One of them is al
ways with the children; Kate, the
older of the two, has just become
obsessed with Grease.
Other than that, they share
responsibilities around the house,
the same car, but not the same
dresser. They have to set limits
somewhere.
The English Department set
out to find someone with energy
to develop the writing program at
the college. What it ended up with
it two unique, but parallel, profes
sors who will certainly bring an
added boost to thedepartment.


Alum to swing in Ballroom Friday night

From Staff Reports
Christopher Jentsch, a 1983
graduate of Gettysburg College,
will perform at the College's Jazz
Ensemble Homecoming Concert

arrangements, and contemporary
fusion, as well as original com
position by Jentsch.
Jentsch is currently a per
forming and recording artist
working primarily in jazz and
contemporary improvisational
forms. After graduating from
Gettysburg College, he com

Pacino saves Devil

Scent of a Woman ). One may
wonder whether the character's
name has anything to do with John
Milton, author of the classic Para
dise Lost, the story of Satan's de
ception of man.
While it is unclear if it is a
compliment, Pacino's smooth and
commanding aura allows him to
play a great Satan. Pacino looks
especially good compared to
Reeves.

Though all the bizarre
events are explained at the close
of the movie, one really has to
question whether it was all quite
necessary.
The same can be said for the
movie's direction. Though all was
drawn together at the end, there
were times when the action seems
to get away from the story line.
Both of the above problems
might have been averted if direc
tor Taylor Hackford (An
Officer and a Gentleman
) would have tried to keep

a stronger grip on the spe
cial effects in The Devil's
Advocate.
Though the movie's
^^_ final scene lost something
_^^H when the film projector
_^^H got too hot and ate the film
_^^H (ironically when John
^^| Milton was trashing God),
PPH Milton's final monologue
I I _f° ws and leads quite well
I _^H up to an explosive but truly
bizarre climax which would have
perhaps made a better ending than
the surprising, though fairly in
conclusive one in The Devil's Ad-

Reel Hits & Misses-

by Jon Froehhch
Staff Writer "Vanity is my favorite sin"
- John Milton
The Devil's Advocate starts
out normally enough. The clash
between small town and big shot
drives a talented, religious, young
man to the big city. Being a law
yer in this particular case, Kevin
Lomax, played by Keanu Reeves
(Point Break, Bill and Ted's Ex
cellent Adventure ), is | fl|
guided by invisible forces
from the closeness of his
Florida home town to the
man-eating streets of New
York City.
As one might guess
from the title of this
movie, the complications
Kevin encounters in "The
Big Apple" are a bit more J
potent than the usual fruit- _^
less quest for a parking _M
space. In fact, as audi- _^B
ences might predict, they're down
right evil.

The Devil s Advocate is re
ally the story of a lawyer who,
though unknowingly, literally
makes a deal with the devil.
Though Lomax's initial success
may be refreshing, audiences will
most likely have a strange feeling
that things are going a little too
well for him.
The root of Lomax's rise
and eventual fall can be identified
in the character of Milton, played
by Al Pacino (Donnie Brasco,

Though Reeves seemed bet
ter in this than many other previ
ous roles (in such forgettable mov
ies as Chain Reaction and A Walk
in the Clouds ), his inconsistent
Southern accent failed to prevent
some of Ted "Theodore" Logan
from seeping through.
Though fairly entertaining,
The Devil's Advocate did have two
persisting problems. It generally
lacked direction and was often a
little too weird and disturbing for
its own good.

vocate.
With good performances by
Pacino and Craig T. Nelson
(Coach ), coupled with a fairly
competent Keanu Reeves, this
movie will most likely entertain,
but it may be tough for some view
ers to enjoy.


Curtain Call
Roosters rebuttal

by Glen Beck
Staff Writer-
As both O&N President and
a person who enjoys theater, I felt
that I must comment on the Roost
ers review of two weeks ago.
I do not wish to put down
Ms. Greely because several of the
points she made were valid. I do,
however, have several problems
with her method of stating her be
liefs. She gives no reasoning be
hind her statements. For example,
Ms. Greely said that two of the
actors had no stage presence.
Fine, but what specifically about
their performances made her feel
this way? Similarly, why did she

feel the choreography of the hu
man roosters looked silly?
I would also like to com
ment on the statement that this was
the best play performed in Kline
but the worst performance of a
play. Apparently, Ms. Greely did
some research to know that
Abuelo was an added feature by
the director. However, the re
viewer should have dug farther. If
she had, she might have found out
more about the director's interpre
tation. Dr. _Mwschamp was in fre
quent contact with the author,
Milcha Sanchez-Scott, discussing
the addition of the grandfather,
which was actually meant to be a
distraction.

Likewise, Dr. Muschamp
spoke with Ms. Scott about the
Shadows, who were meant to be

seen as a stage presence.
Further, the reviewer should
have researched the concept of
"magic realism." At times, con
ventions such as poses, tableaus,
and _^deliberate movement' were
used to relay character relation
ships and intentions.

What is your opinion on course evaluations?

-Focus

by Rebecca Babbitt
Editor- in - Chief



Dear Casey..

Dear Casey,
I am having a problem. I
have a roommate I really like,
but I don't care for her boy
friend. It seems he's always in
the room; he's practically
moved in. The room is small for
two people as it is, and to make
matters worse, his friends are al
ways over as well and calling for
him at all hours of the night. I
am really getting annoyed at this
situation. What should I do?
Lost in the Room
Dear Lost in the Room,
This seems to go back to the
old adage: two is company and
three is a crowd, and your room is
seeming to get awful crowded
right now.
Let me emphasize again,
YOUR room. The room is tech
nically half yours, and you have
every right to defend your prop
erty.

One question I have for you
is, does your roommate realize
how annoyed you are getting at
this situation? If she does not, I
think you need to give her a few
quick slaps of reality, or you could
always take her to Wal-Mart and
buy her a clue.
Seriously, you should try to
explain to her how you feel that
your personal space is being vio
lated and that you would like to see
this situation changed.
Suggest that she go and visit
his domicile for a while. Ask if it
is really necessary that he lives
with you two in your ever-so-spa
cious living arrangements.

Howard in Gettysburg by Myles Price

Talk it out with your room
mate. If you have been passively
sitting by twiddling your thumbs,
this might have contributed to this
progressive problem.
As for the boyfriend's
friends, inform them that Mr. Joe
Wonderful does not live in this
room and do not try and reach him
there. You are going to have to
stand up for yourself in a situation
like this.
If all else fails, then it is time
for a demonstration of your an
noyance. Show them how obnox
ious they are. One method I have
found to be almost faultless is
playing Christmas music in Octo
ber at a high volume, while sing
ing along with the wrong words
or a Spanish version.
That may not be your style.
If that's the case, then invite your
friends over and throw a little
party, just as the two lovebirds are
about to go to sleep.

These examples might seem
extreme, but the point is that you
need to have your voice heard and
have your roommate not only re
alize your annoyance but under
stand it.
Dear Casey,
I went home for, Reading
Days, and I was able to see some
old friends. I had gone out of
state for college, and they have
stayed home. It seems that there
is a lot of distance between us
and that they are not the same
people as they were before. I am
upset about this space between
us. Do you have any advice?

Drifted Dear Drifted,
First, you need to realize
that the only thing that is perma
nent in life is change and that
change is truly inevitable. This
being said, change is sometimes
hard to deal with.
Another thing is that you
have probably changed as well,
not just your friends. You should
take that into consideration before
you are so quick to judge your
friends for changing.
There is an old saying: ab¬

sence makes the heart grow
fonder. Unfortunately, that is not
always the case, especially when
one goes away to college.
College is a time for chang
ing and growing, and you can not
let yourself get wrapped up in
what could have been, or what
should have been, and what is not.
Even though you and your
friends have grown apart, that does
not still mean you cannot be
friends. As they say, make new
friends and keep the old, one is
silver and the other, gold.

And be sure to remember
that friendship is a two-way road.
You can not expect your friends
to just sit back and watch you
grow and change while waiting
around for you to come home on
your vacations.
This advice is a bitter pill to
swallow, but it is the truth, and
more often than not, the truth
hurts. Any questions ? Send to Box
434.

Conflict and Consensus

To the Editor

First of all, I would like to
thank and commend Musselman
Hall residents for their diligent and
stupendous efforts during the re
cent fire caused by the careless
burning of candles. Too often we
tend to focus on the negative as
pects of an incident such as this,
and we forget to say thank you to
those who truly deserve it. The
residents of Musselman Hall were
incredible in helping one another
out during this crisis. In addition,
a big THANK YOU goes to the
officers and dispatchers working in

the Safety and Security office.
Their quick thinking and fast work
saved us all from potential disas
ter. Unfortunately sometimes,
when incidents like this occur,
there are often many inaccurate
rumors which somehow get spread
across campus. One such rumor
that has surfaced relates to "ran
dom" room searches. I would like
to put this in perspective, and to
acknowledge any responsibility I
or any other staff member had for
this misinformation. Contrary to

To the Editor:
This letter is in response to
last week's cover article titled,
"Party On." I must first commend
the author for accurately report
ing the story and giving Sigma
Alpha Epsilon its due credit for
handling the touchy situation. We
had a situation in which a student
from another college caused a dis
ruption in a crowded house. As
to not let the commotion spread
further, we promptly escorted the
individual out of our house. We
handled the incident impeccably
and kept the crowd's evacuation

calm and collective.
I must then delve deeper
and berate the editor for placing
this inconsequential story on the
cover of the Gettysburgian. One
would hope that there would be
much more important and press
ing issues to bless the cover of this
paper. Our fraternity, SAE, has
been working frivolously to eradi
cate the marred reputation that our
fraternity has endured. We have
been taking a more responsible
approach to social events and have
successfully had numerous parties
that have not had one bottle, can,

the recent letter to the editor, Secu
rity does not "randomly" search resi
dence hall rooms. Students, as ten
ants, are entitled to reasonable pri
vacy in College residence hall
rooms. However, the College does
make periodic inspections of and
maintenance visits to all college resi
dence hall rooms for reasons of
health, safety or possible policy vio
lations. Typically student staff mem
bers of Residence Life are respon
sible for dealing with related policy
violations. When possible, the stu
dent is present during this type of in
spection.
A search, as distinguished
from an inspection, involves a thor
ough examination of the residence
and personal possessions in relation
to a specific violation. A search is
undertaken only with the authoriza
tion of the Dean of the College, and
would never "randomly" occur.
I hope that this has helped to
clear the confusion.
Sincerely,

Christina N. Bell
Residence Coordinator
Musselman Hall

or cup of alcohol. This is a success
ful advance in social events on this
campus and I believe we should be
recognized for this rather than events
that really have no significance. We
are conscious of our reputation on
campus and are working to change
the erroneous, but prominent, opin
ion of our fraternity. The Sigma Al
pha Epsilon of today is not the devi
ant SAE of years past. We are a
strong brotherhood trying to gain
positive notoriety.
Even though the story was ac
curately reported and relieved of all

responsibility, the mere placement of
the article on the cover of the Get
tysburgian, nonetheless damages our
image. My purpose of writing this
letter is to make the campus com
munity aware of the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon of today. We are a frater
nity trying to establish a positive and
cooperative image that will vanquish
past prejudices toward SAE. The in
cident that took place a couple of
weekends ago was an unforeseen oc
currence that was handled in a fault
less manner, but this story should not
be a cover article.

Consider this ...

Each semester at the end of
each course, every student is
given the opportunity to evaluate
the course, the teacher, and the
course materials. This exercise
gives each student the unique op
portunity to give unvarnished
opinions and possibly effect some
significant change.
Unfortunately, more often
than not, students either use these
evaluations as revenge against the
professor, or they do not bother
to put any time or effort into them.
Moreover, professors them
selves are often guilty of giving
evaluations, which can improve
their craft as teachers and their
courses, short shrift by handing
them out before the final exam or
waiting until the last ten minutes
of the last class.
Furthermore, there seems to
be a general apathy about the va
lidity and usefulness of these
evaluations both by students and
faculty.

However, Kallon v. Gettys
burg College, which is using these
evaluations as evidence, proves
that evaluations do have useful
ness outside of filling time on the
last day of class.
Yet, although this recent
case is proving that evaluations
can be useful to some end, there
is still the issue of getting the
evaluations to work for the good

of the college community.
How can the college com
munity as a whole reevaluate how
we use course evaluations to im
prove the quality of education here
at Gettysburg College?
For starters, the faculty and
administration of the college
should change how the evaluations
are used.
For one, the evaluations
should be handed out earlier than
the last class, and sufficient time
needs to be given to fill them out.
Further, each department
should revise their respective
evaluations keeping in mind cre
ating questions which give ad
equate opportunities to offer sub
stantive constructive criticisms.
Finally, the professors need
to sit down and consciously read
these evaluations not as assaults
but rather tools which can make
them better teachers.

As for all the students out
there, take the time to give some
meaningful commentary on your
courses and your professors.
So often students are left out
of the decision making process
when it comes to forming the sub
stance of their education, evalua
tions give you the opportunity to
make a change.
Gettysburg College is your
school, don't waste your opportu
nity to change it.

Voice IS an
INSTRUMENT

To the leaders of the new a
cappella group, Doug Walsh and
Jenny Bland... first of all congrats
on your endeavors to form a new
singing group on campus. Hav
ing just read the feature article
about you and your group, I find it
to be most exciting and long time
in coming. However, I found the
headline "Instruments? We don't
need no stinkin' instruments!"
quite offensive and in bad taste.
Don't forget, voice IS an instru
ment and your audience will be
comprised of, hopefully, hundreds
of music enthusiasts who love and
play instruments. The lack of his
torical research by yourselves, the
author of the article and senior,
Jonathon Black about singing
groups on this campus from early
days is disappointing. If you had
gone to the college archives, you
would have been pleased to dis
cover any number of such "a

cappella" groups in the past, and
used for the same purpose as in the
contemporary sense. The Gettys
burg College Choir has its roots in
a cappella singing, but choral lit
erature incorporating instruments
today has broadened and enhanced
that picture for us. As its director,
my first love is performing and lis
tening to a capella music. I was
blessed to have heard the current
famous five from Holland named
the Quinks last Monday night at
Mount Saint Mary's. They were
stupendous. Maybe you were
there? Should your group ever
reach that status, Gettysburg Col
lege will be on the musical map,
in spite of the Music Department.
There is an abundance of raw mu
sical talent on this campus... you
have the potential of success at
your finger... pardon me, vocal
tips! I can hardly wait to be "ser
enaded by (the) new a cappella
group"! Good luck!

Conflict and Consensus —
From The Pachyderm's Pulpit

Al Gore is no angel

On a sunny July day in 1992
outside the Arkansas Governor's
Mansion, a marriage made in me
dia heaven was made as Governor
Bill Clinton tapped Tennessee
Senator Al Gore to be his running
mate. Clinton and Gore at first
seemed to be very much alike.
Both were southern "New" Demo
crats, reasonably moderate, and
young. The picture that the Demo
crats wanted to portray was youth,
moderation, and a new generation
ready to take command. More
than any of that the Clinton team
put Al Gore on the Democratic
ticket because Senator Gore helped
erase Governor Clinton's nega
tives. While Bill Clinton dodged
the draft, Al Gore served in Viet
nam. Governor Clinton had his
share of sex scandals and Senator
Gore by all accounts had a very
strong marriage. As governor
Clinton's record on the environ¬

ment was very shady, and Al Gore
was loved by the environmental
ists, which has always been his pri
mary issue as shown by his book,
Earth in the Balance.
In 1992, the Clinton-Gore
campaign with their bus caravans
were instantly loved by the liberal
media. A new day had arrived, but
when the two landed in Washing¬

ton after dislodging President
George Bush and Vice President
Dan Quayle, Americans realized
that their new 43% president was
not exactly what they had ex
pected. He had caved in to the left,
lacked the leadership needed for
the Oval Office, and had a staff that
was not prepared for the Presi
dency. In 1994, the American
people punished President Clinton
and put Republicans in control of
Congress for the first time in forty

years. During the time while Bill
and first lady Hillary Clinton
(sorry, I mean Rodham-Clinton)
were being bashed over taxes,
healthcare, and scandals, "Honest"
Al Gore remained popular. The
president and vice president by all
accounts are very close. Vice
President Gore is one of the
president's closest advisors. It was
Al Gore who led the Reinventing
Government plan and it was the
vice president who has always
been there to deflect presidential
criticism. By 1996, there was no
question that Al Gore would once
again be on the Democratic ticket
and at the Chicago Convention he
was able to speak on his own night.
The talk was that the president was
going to work to help the vice
president receive the Democratic

Nomination for president uncon
tested in 2000.
Now the tables have turned
on the vice president, as he now
need the President Clinton's scan
dal cronies, who have been
through perhaps the most presiden
tial scandals in American Presiden
tial history. The latest scandal has
to deal with the selling of the presi
dency to domestic and foreign in
terests. The vice president is ac
cused of making calls for cam
paign cash on federal property
which is against the law.
The other offense being lev
eled at our good vice president is
his appearance at a Buddhist
temple for a fundraiser, an outright
violation of federal campaign laws
created after Watergate. For all the
bashing the Democrats give to the
Christian Coalition over cam¬

paigning in churches, Vice Presi
dent Gore is showing his true col
ors as a liberal hypocrite. While
claiming not to be aware of the fact
that it was a fundraiser where ille
gal foreign money was given, the
Vice President's schedule calls it a
fundraising event. The American
people are not stupid and now that
Attorney General "Stonewall"
Janet Reno has opened up an in
vestigation of Mr. Gore, perhaps
we can get to the truth over pos¬

sible espionage in the 1996 Presi
dential campaign.
The vice president earlier
this year looked foolish while an
swering questions over illegal acts
he may have committed last year.
In China, he was upstaged by
House Speaker Newt Gingrich
who had the courage to criticize
the Chinese over human rights
abuses, while Al Gore toasted the
butchers of Beijing. Just maybe
this was because they helped re
elect him and President Clinton
over a true American war hero,
Boh Dole.

Al Gore is getting his first
taste of negative press and he is
showing that he is not as savvy as
his ultimate politician partner, Bill
Clinton. While Al Gore slammed
big tobacco's support for the Re
publican Party, the Gore family
owns and operates tobacco farms.
If you listen to the Democratic
National Convention in 1992, Al
Gore was a working boy from ru
ral Tennessee. The truth is, Al
Gore was born, raised, and edu
cated in Washington, D.C. His fa
ther was a United States senator,
and since 1977 Al Gore has
worked in the Capitol.

The media blasted Mr.
Gore's predecessor, Dan Quayle,
over stupid things; they refuse to

do the same to Al Gore. When Al
Gore, in front of the cameras at
Montecello, asked who was the
painting of that he was looking at,
the response was George Washing
ton. Imagine if Dan Quayle had
done that. Furthermore, unlike Al
Gore who changed his position on
abortion to cater to the left, Dan
Quayle always stood up for what
he believed despite what liberals
yelled.
If Al Gore thinks the presi
dency is his in 2000, than there are
a few Democrats like House Mi
nority Leader Dick Gephardt,
former United States Senator Bill
Bradley, United States Senator
Bob Kerry, and Reverend Jesse
Jackson may have something to
say about that. They all have been
mistreated by the Clinton-Gore
team at one time or another and
now that Bill Clinton is finished
electorally, then Vice President
Gore will likely be their target.

If the vice president makes
it through the scandals and wins
his party's nod in 2000, then he will
have to face his biggest obstacle, a
Republican Party hungry to regain
the White House. The GOP has
not forgotten that it was President
Clinton's loyal sidekick Al Gore
who broke the tie in the Senate that
gave the largest tax increase in
American history.

everyone enjoyed their Reading
Days, and got a lot of work done.
We did. Anyway, First Year males
should look out for your rush
booklet which should be coming
in your mailboxes by the end of
next week. The booklet will con
tain information about each frater¬

nity on campus. It should be a
great way for First Years to get
better acquainted with the frater
nities, and for the fraternities to
portray themselves to the First Year
guys. Lambda Chi Alpha is con
tinuing their long tradition of par
ticipating in the North American
Food Drive (NAFD). This is the
largest single day food drive in
North America, and has been
Lambda Chi's annual philanthropy

project. This year Gettysburg s
Lambda Chi chapter has set a goal
to collect 3,000 pounds of nonper
ishable foods. Anyone, or any or
ganization who would like to help
them out by contributing food or
money should contact Bill Burns

don't wait too long.
Something to look out for in
the upcoming weeks is an all cam
pus party to be held behind Alpha

Tau Omega. Many organizations
on campus, including fraternities
and sororities have agreed to help
sponsor the event. There will be
no alcohol served, but bands will
be playing so there is no doubt that
it should be a great time. We will
have more details in the future as

In case anyone forgot, this
weekend is Homecoming. That
means hundreds of alumni will be
back on campus, many of whom

were Greek, and are looking for
ward to visiting their houses, and
I'm sure they would prefer to see
them in pristine condition, so try
to clean up your houses for this
weekend.

Conflict and Consensus —
From The Donkey's Mouth
Campaign finance, a serious issue

By Matt Brown
Contributing Writer
Has anyone noticed how
undemocratic our nation has be
come? Today, our nation's Repub
lican led Congress continues to
blatantly ignore the interests and
desires of the American people.
America wants and needs cam
paign finance reform. America
wants to see money lose influence
and issues gain influence in elec
tions. We want leaders who rep
resent us, not leaders who repre
sent a few political action commit
tees (PAC_'s) and privileged and
wealthy businessmen, doctors and
lawyers who contribute large sums
of money to their campaigns. The
majority of Americans want our
government to put an end to the
pervasive influence of money in
politics. Of course, it is a fantasy
to think that their will be a time
that money will be completely
eliminated from politics, but we

must be able to improve our sys
tem over the current one. Today
our system of campaign finance is
being abused by both the Demo
cratic and Republican parties as
they receive money from foreign
contributors. Today it has become
obvious that money does buy ac
cess to the _president. America
wants reform and Congress has yet
to deliver.
Isn't it funny that while Re
publicans attack and criticize our
current campaign finance system
in the investigation of the fund rais
ing practices of the Clinton/Gore
campaign, that these same Repub
licans are the ones blocking reform
on these very same issues in the
Senate. These hypocrites obvi
ously do not care about campaign
finance reform, all they care about
is furthering their own political
agenda by trying to drag out the
president's unethical fund raising
Dractices to weaken him. The Re¬

publicans continue to preach about
how corrupt the system was, yet
most of them continue to do noth
ing about it. Meanwhile, President
Clinton and Vice-President Gore,
the "guilty"-parties continue to
push for reform. Why do the Re
publicans practice this kind of hy
pocrisy? Because they don't want
to bite the hands that feed them.
The Republicans who consistently
raise more money than Democrats
don't want to damage the system
that has traditionally benefitted
them. In their greed, they continue
to block reform. Republicans are
guilty of the kind of things the
president has done too, it just so
happens that Chairman Fred Th
ompson continues to abuse com
mittee rules surprising the Demo
crats on the committee, led by
Senator John Glenn with subpoe
nas and preventing the Democrats
from issuing the subpoenas they
want. The Republicans gloss over

the fact that they received money
from Hong Kong and are seeking
to cover up the outbreak of a Japa
nese money scandal. The party
leading the charge in the investi
gation is also a coconspirator in
the abuse of the system. Their op
position is based on the opinion
that if you limit the amount of
money a person can contribute you
limit their right to free speech.
Well, if speech is equivalent to
money, then a small and privileged
few are able to talk a whole lot
louder and longer than the major
ity of us nearly mute Americans.
Not all Senate Republicans
are guilty of hypocrisy. In fact,
Republican Senator John McCain
of Arizona has written a bill that
would reform our system. How
ever only a handful of brave Re
publicans and the Democrats in the
Senate support it, not enough to
muster the 60 votes that they would
need to break Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott's filibuster. Lott

has vowed that campaign finance
reform will not come from this
session of Congress. So what can
we do now, when the Republican
leadership has vowed to never re
lent in its opposition to campaign
finance reform? Well we could all
call ourcongresspersons and sena
tors and let them know that
America demands campaign fi
nance reform. Or next year we
could make history. We could
make history by electing a Demo
cratic controlled House, the first
time ever that the president's party
would gain seats during midterm
elections. That event along with
getting enough Senators Democrat
or Republican that support reform
would finally bring about the
change that we want and need.
Everyone can see that the systems
broken, but we do not have the
leadership in Congress to fix it.
America needs a new Congress, a
Democratic congress to bring
about real change.

To the Editor: Student blasts Burgian

To the editors of The Gettys
burgian,
My name is James
McCusker and I am a second se
mester senior at Gettysburg Col
lege. I was readmitted at the start
of this semester, after being away
from the college for three years,
and in the time that I have been
away I am shocked and saddened
by the deterioration of the Gettys
burg College school newspaper,
The Gettysburgian. I will use the
most recent October 9 issue as an
example. In the Oct 9 issue the
mistakes, omissions and quality of
the articles was pathetic. The back
page sports article reported on the
football team's loss to Johns
Hopkins but never even reported a
final score!!! Instead the reporter
seemed too interested in being the
Chris Berman of print as he tries
to annoyingly give every Bullet

player a nickname. I can under
stand some omissions but lack of
a final score is unforgivable. On
page 17 there was a small article
reporting on the debut of the
women's rugby team, once again
not only was there no final score
reported, but the article was cut off
mid-sentence!!! Then on page 12
there was the article on Greek
Week. Again, the article was un
clear as to which fraternity/soror
ity were the overall winners. The
article listed winners of the indi
vidual events but no overall win
ner. The closest it came was to stat
ing "The final standings were as
follows. For the men, finishing in
third was Fiji, while Sigma Nu fin
ished in second." First, the sen
tence does not clear up whether the
winners mentioned were in regard
to the airbands or for all of Greek
Week and second, it lists the third

and second place fraternities but no
first place winner is listed!!!
At the same time The Get
tysburgian reviews a movie "Clue"
which came out 12 years ago!!!
Hello!!!! The freshman were 6
years old when this movie was on
the big screen!!! It was panned
then as it should have been for be
ing a truly bad movie. Why are
we concerning ourselves with it
now? Meanwhile the school and
the newspaper are concerning
themselves with the same old tired
issue of drinking that they have for
the last 15 years. This is not to
say that drinking is a non-issue, but
there is nothing new about the re
porting or the problem and every
one acts like students drinking is a
new phenomena and problem at
Gettysburg and it is not. The col
lege restricts fraternity parties,
clamps down on drinking in

dorms, provides no school sup
ported or regulated social gather
ings where alcohol is served and
then has the nerve to wonder why
there is an increase in off-campus
parties!!! Wake up for gods sake!!!
Students are going to find a way
to party and blow off steam, the
best thing the school could do is
provide a supervised environment
to reduce underaged drinking and
ensure no one gets hurt. While The
Gettysburgian was pondering the
student drinking "problem" for the
50,000 time, a real story of national
interest was taking place about the
Gettysburg battlefields and the
controversy surrounding the park
service and it's plans for private
investment and development. This
story was covered with a full page
article in USA Today and a 2
minute piece on NBC National
News with Tom Rrokaw. but did

the Gettysburgian cover it?
Shamefully, no.
I understand that Gettysburg
College does not have a journal
ism school and that The Gettys
burgian is going through some for
mat changes but these problems
are inexcusable. In the three years
that I have been away from Get
tysburg, I have been working as an
assistant producer at CBS News,
and I would be ashamed to show
this newspaper to any of my co
workers as a representation of my
alma mater. One of the first things
I learned when working on my
high school newspaper was in your
article always remember to report
"who, what, where, when and
why" perhaps this should be re
minded to the staff of The Gettys
burgian.
Sincerely,
James McCusker






Cross Country teams leave their mark

by Peter Huminski
Staff Writer The Bullet cross country
teams were busy competing the
last two weeks in the Dickinson
Invitational on October 11 and the
Allentown Invitational on October
18. There was a lot for the Bul
let harriers to pleased about this
past weekend. The men's team
finished fourth with 189 points,
behind first place Haverford (34
points).
Running for the second
week in a row without top fresh
man Jon Catlett, the Bullet men
put together an excellent team
race. There were only SO seconds
separating the Bullets' first six
runners.
"It is the best meet the guys
team has had since the beginning
of September," said Bullets coach
Robert Condon.

The Bullets were led by se
nior Jason Smith, who finished
23rd in a time of 27:32. He was
followed by James Smith (28th,
27:40), Kris Weum (39, 27:58),
Brendon Clark (46, 28:11), Dave
Gary (53,28:20), Brian Rusignolo
(55,28:22), and Ken Lodge (109,
29:33).
In the women's race senior
Wendy Johnston paced the Bullets
to a fourteenth place finish out of
33 teams. Bloomsburg won the
team title with 56 points. Johnston
finished fifthteenth overall in a
time of 19:36. She was closely
followed by Martie Calello (31,
20:08), Joyce O'Neil (86, 21:14),
and Karen Helmick (104, 21:39).
Freshman Kim Heimerl, Kristin
Mills, and Junior Krissy Snell
rounded out the Bullets top seven.
"Wendy looked the best she
has in few weeks," said Condon.
"She had a real strong finish, but
was just unable to make up the

ground on the top kids."
"Both teams ran pretty
well," said Condon. "Both teams
have been pretty tired for the lasl
couple of weeks. The importanl
thing is that they have their legs
back underneath them. We have a
ways to go until the Regional
meet." Over Reading Days while
most of us were heading home the
Bullet harriers competed in the
Dickinson Invitational. The Bul
let men finished sixth in the 36
team field, while the women fin
ished eleventh in the 33 team field.
The College of New Jersey won
the men's race and CMU was vic
torious for the women.
The Bullet men were led by
lason Smith and James Smith who
finished 24th and 25th respec
tively. Weum, Gary, Rusignolo,
George Torgun, and Clark
rounded out the top seven finish
ers for the Bullets.

Rusignolo has slowly
worked his way back into the top
seven after a slow start to the sea
son. "Brian didn't jump back into
his training too fast," said Condon.
"He finally started to look decent
in his last race. He is solid and
consistent and has a lot of ability."
Johnston once again led the
Bullet women finishing thirteenth
in 19:26. Calello finished
eighteeth overall in 19:47. O'Neil
finished third for the Bullets and
101 overall in 21:42. Mills,
Heimerl, Tracy Swackhammer,
and Helmick rounded out the Bul
lets top seven finishers.
"Joyce has been laid up for
the last week," said Condon. "She
missed a week of training with an
illness and you are seeing the re
sults of that in her time. She has
been a real tough competitor this
year." "We're hoping that as we go
into peaking times will start drop-

FORE!
Golf team driving away Centennial
Conference oppositon

by Rick Deutsch
Contributing Writer
The golf team's impressive
showing at Bent Creek Country
Club in Lancaster, Pennsylvania
last Monday meant much more
than just wins and losses. Prior to
Monday, the Bullets hadn't placed
higher than sixth in either of their
two previous tournaments, one of
which was played.at their home

course, Gettysburg Country Club.
The team tied for third in a
field of eight teams as Millersville
B team and Millersville A team
took home first and second place
finishes, respectively. Even
more promising for the S
Bullets is the fact that _S
Millersville teams _S
play Division II ath- V

letics, including
golf. B e n ti
Creek's tight fair
ways, slick I
greens, tough pin I
placements, and a
plethora of OB
markers made for
some very high
numbers on many
scorecards. This
proved to be an ad
vantage for the Bul
lets as they kept
their high numbers
at a minimum and
turned in low scores,
relative to the pack
of 40 plus players.
Low man for
the Bullets was
junior Matt '
Beclcert who fired a

10-over 81, a score which earned
him fifth place in the individual
standings. Freshman John
Hargreaves, sporting his back
wards orange Bullets hat, shot a
solid 84.
Sophomore Rick Deutsch
carded a respectable 87 with se
nior Hunter Leahey close behind
with an 88.

Previously this season, the
Bullets placed a disappointing six
out of 11 teams as they hosted
their annual Gettysburg Invita
tional. Bright spots were
Beckert's six-over 77, and solid
play from freshman sensations
Joel "I'm not related to Coach or
Barb" Streeter and Casey Martin
who each carded 81's.

_^H team should have
_^H capitalized on the
_^H _^ advantage of being
_^^^^^ familiar with each
_^^^^_T hole, which the
^^^ Bullets failed to do.
In their only other tourna
ment this season, the team fell
prey to Hershey East's long and
intimidating holes and placed a
miserable eight out of a pack of
12 teams. Having only had two
players on the squad who had pre
viously played Hershey hurt the
Bullets as well.

Possibly distracted by the
overpowering and unrelenting
smell of chocolate in the air, none
of the five Bullet starters ever got
his swing together. Low scores for
the Bullets were turned in by
Streeter and Deutsch who each
fired 89's.
This week's turnaround at
Bent Creek not only marks the
first time the Bullets put more

The Bullets still feel they
plenty of talent and all the
it takes to be a winning team

have tools

and equally important, Centennial
Conference Champions. Head
Coach Casey Counseller stressed
that the team needs to work on a
shot-by-shot approach to their
rounds and gain more of an ag
gressive and competitive attitude
to win.
_Counselor's theory is to for
get the bad shot you may have just
hit and not hit six more consecu
tive bad shots, but rather to re
member that each swing is a sepa
rate entity from the one before it.
Counseller remains confi
dent in his team and stresses his
theories before and after each
match. After Bent Creek, he gave
the team a few words of wisdom.
He first stated that he feels the
_y team could win every tour
Bfttament if everyone would

remain focused on their goal.
Then, for a refresher, he re
minded everyone of their main
objective. "Guys, what you need
to remember is that what you are
trying to do out there...is to get the
ball in the hole in as few strokes
as possible."
Sound advice, coach. If the
team keeps progressing and fol
lows that plan, it should be win
ning many tournaments very soon.

The second half or play by
the _Bulletsivas equally as impres
sive as the first half. Adam
Outeridge and Jim Nastashi both
scored a goal to further strengthen
the Bullet lead. With this win the
Bullets are now 9-3-1 overall, and
3-0-1 in conference play.
They are now currently
ranked third in the region and are
ranked twentysecond in the na
tion. The Bullets next game is an
away game at Catholic University
on October 23, at 3:30.
Other Notes: On October 4,
the Bullets rocked Haverford
College's world. Goals were
scored by Chris Pryor, Jessie
Flynn, and Jason Vishio.
On October 15, the Bullets
spanked Wesley College 6-2.
There were six different goal scor
ers for the Bullets. They included:
Chris Pryor, Jim Green, Adam
Outeridge, Jim Natashi, Jason
Vishio, and Jeremy Shapiro.

On October 18, at 4:00
p.m., the Gettysburg soccer team
took on Ursinus at home in con
ference play. The Ursinus team
left town utterly defeated as the
Bullets rolled over the Bears 6
1. The offense once again
showed its dominance as it has
recorded 12 goals in the last two
games.
The Bullets' defense also
demonstrated their power as they
allowed only a small number of
shots. The Bullets acted quickly
in the first half as they jumped
out to a 4-0 lead. Greg Stevcic
had two goals, while Chris Pryor
and Matt Kelly each scored one
goal. Goal keeper John Katerba
had a great first half as he shut
out the Bears.


Bears and bees take bite out of Bullets

by Peter Huminski
Staff Writer The Gettysburg Bullets
dropped their third game in a row
Saturday when the Bullets lost to
Ursinus, 13-2.
The Bullets were held deep
in their own territory for most of
the game only accumulating 230
total yards of offense.
The vaunted Bullets running
game was limited to 124 yards by
the Bears defense.
Gettysburg trailed 7-0 in the
third quarter when the Bullets de
fense came up big. Ursinus quar
terback Craig Messick handed off
to running back Joe Conte who
was met in the end zone by a wait
ing safety Kevin Gurski. Gurski
led the Bullets with ten tackles.
The Bullets now trailed, 7
2, but were forced to punt after
only three plays on the ensuing
free kick.

The Bears then put the game
out of reach by marching 75 yards
on 11 plays and scored on a Joe
Nangle two-yard touchdown run.
The Bears accumulated over 300
yards of offense against the Bul
lets and improved their record to
3-4 overall, and 2-3 in the confer¬

ence. Fullback Paul Smith led the
Bullets rushing offense with 51
yards on 16 carries. Smith was
also Gettysburg's top receiver
catching three passes for 51 yards.
In only his second start
freshman quarterback Dennis
Flaherty completed 8-29 passes
for 106 yards in the air. Flaherty
spread the receiving wealth com
pleting passes to Smith, Jeff Closz,
Mike Holm, Matt Helwig, and
Tighe Burns. The loss drops he
Bullets to 2-4 on the season, and
1-3 in the Centennial Conference.

It was another long day for
the Gettysburg faithful who stuck
around to watch the Bullets over
Reading Days. Randolph Macon
came calling to Musselman sta
dium Saturday, October 11 and
steamrolled the Bullets 44-13.
The score, however, does
not indicate how well the Bullets
played. Trailing 10-0 in the first
quarter the Bullets got fired up and
scored a touchdown on a 56 yard
pass to Jeff Closz from freshman
quarterback Dennis Flaherty.
On the Yellow Jackets next
possession the Bullets defense
came up big. Defensive end Jus
tin Domingos sacked Yellow
Jacket quarterback Sidney
Chappell forcing a fumble which
Domingos recovered.

The Bullets were in business
on the Randolph Macon 16 yard
line. Two rushing plays each by
Paul Smith and Matt Helwig got
the Bullets down to the 3 yard line.
On third and goal Flaherty rolled
right out of the pocket and found
Smith for his second touchdown
pass of the game to give the Bul
lets a 13-10 lead with 12:14 to go
in the first half.
This was as close as the Bul
lets would be able to get as the Yel-

low Jackets scored two more start Flaherty completed 12 of 24

touchdowns in the first half to
make the score 24-13 at the half.
The Bullets were unable to
sustain any momentum in the sec
ond half as the offensive line was
unable to open up any holes for
Smith and Helwig to run through.
The Bullets came into
Saturday's game ranked fourteenth
in rushing offense with 269.8
yards a game. The swarming Yel
low Jacket defense only allowed
the Bullets to gain 42 yards on the
ground.
"Their offense made a lot of
plays," said Bullets Head Coach
Barry Streeter. "We showed some
signs in the first half, but we're just
not making the plays defensively."
The Bullets defense made
some plays in the first half but was
unable to stop the experienced Yel
low Jacket offense. The Jackets
gained 575 yards in total offense.
Randolph Macon had a very bal
anced attack passing for 288 yards
and rushing for 287 yards.

"I thought Dennis Flaherty
did a lot of good things," said
Streeter. "He got all the repetitions
with the first group in practice. His
timing was better and he showed
some poise."
Freshman quarterback Den
nis Flaherty was a bright spot for
the Bullets. In his first collegiate

passes for 164 yards and two
touchdowns.
Flaherty's favorite target
was Closz who finished the game
with 100 yards on four catches and
one touchdown.
"It's going to be a battle un
til the end," said Streeter. "If you're
going to fight, you have to fight
four quarters."
The Bullets (2-4, 1-3 in
Centennial Conference) will have
their chance to fight again this Sat
urday when they host Muhlenberg
this Saturday in Musselman Sta
dium at 1:00 p.m.

Hit me with your best "Schott"
Sophomore Cat Schott "kills " Centennial Conference Competition

"The
team is a
great
bunch of
girls."

by Chesha Miller
Staff Writer

There are few people that
would go out of their way for any
one else and who always place
themselves behind others. Sopho
more volleyball player Catherine
Schott is one of those rare people.
Catherine, who is affection
ately called Cat, is one of the nic
est and most caring people you
will ever meet. "I am a good lis
tener," Schott said, "if anyone, a
teammate or friend, needs a shoul
der to lean on, or someone to lis
ten to them, they can always come

Although she has these
qualities, she is still a very com
petitive person who is willing push
herself and those around her to do
their best. Schott began her ath
letic career as a sixth grader, par
ticipating in volleyball, basketball,
and track.
Throughout her years at
Montrose High School in Colo
rado, Catherine was always par
tial to track but that eventually
changed. "Volleyball was just a
sport to play," explained Schott, "I
didn't expect it to be so much fun."
Aside from volleyball being so
enjoyable for Catherine, she also
has immense talent.
During her sophomore year
at Montrose, she was approached
by a recruiting service who helped
convince Schott to play volleyball
in college and to help her find the
right place for her.

The recruiting service sug
gested Gettysburg because of its
combined academic and athletic
strength. "I was really happy to
find a place where academics
come first and then athletics,"
Catherine explained, "there is a
good balance between the two
here." Gettysburg was just as lucky
to find Catherine as she was to find
Gettysburg. In a little less than a
year and a half, Schott has made
quite an impression on campus.
An honor student and consistent
Dean's List honoree, Catherine
finished up her freshman year with
an impressive 3.7 grade point av
erage, placing her very near the
top of her class.

This also enabled Catherine
to join Alpha Lambda Delta, an
honor society for superior aca
demic achievement during the first
year of college. Catherine has had
an equally impressive first two
volleyball seasons at Gettysburg.
As a first year student she
made the first All-Regional and
All-Centennial Conference teams,
was named as Centennial Confer
ence player of the week, and was
also named to the All-Tournament
team at every tournament Gettys
burg played, including both of
Gettysburg's own tournaments.
The middle blocker ended
last season ranked sixth in the na
tion for hitting percentage. She is
presently ranked second in the na
tion for hitting percentage and
17th for kills per game.

When you talk to Schott, she
won't tell you about any of her ac
complishments. In fact, she hardly
talks about herself, and when she
talks about volleyball she simply
speaks about the team. Gettysburg
College volleyball coach Kim
Rain explained, "Cat is not a cocky
person, she is definitely very mod
est and alsovery team oriented.
It is so nice to have some
one like that." Rain describes

coaching Catherine as "a once in
a lifetime experience." Schott is
extremely hard working and she
always goes above and beyond
what is required to be sure she is
getting the most out of her athletic
experience.
She understands that she

still has a lot to learn and is al
ways willing to listen to the ad
vice of her coaches. "Cat is a lis
tener and really takes our advice
into stride." said Rain, "she never

questions our judgments and al
ways goes after what she wants."
On the flip side Schott also
knows how to have fun and enjoy
her sport. "She A "s silly," Coach
Rain said laughing, "she's becom
ing really outgoing and is totally
opening herself up to the team."
Catherine's teammates are really
impressed by the combination of
her great attitude and competitive
edge. Catherine has a lot of respect
and admiration for her teammates
and coaches as well.
"Last year was a transition
year for all of us [as we got new
coaches]," says Schott, "Coach
Rain and Coach Armocost made
the adjustment fun for all of us,
and they are continuing to do so."
Schott_'s attitude towards volley
ball is to take one game at a time.
Though very competitive,
Schott only worries about the task
at hand, instead of concentrating
on future games. "I do stupid
things to make volleyball a fun
sport," says Schott, "It A "s an out
let for me and is not my whole
life." For this season Catherine A "s
goal is to accomplish the team
goals, which were set at the be
ginning of the season, and to con
tinue to have fun playing volley¬

ball. "The team is a great bunch
of girls," said Schott, "we have a
lot of fun together both on and off
the court." Catherine does look
into the future in other aspects of
her life. She is a political science
and Spanish double major, who is
planning to become a lawyer.
At this time she is leaning
towards criminal law and a prac
tice as a trial attorney but that
could change at any time. During
the spring semester of her junior
year Catherine plans to go to
Spain. The study abroad is re
quired by all Spanish majors, but
would also give Schott the long
awaited opportunity to travel to
Europe.
Schott attributes her hard
work and dedication to her parents
Pat and Paul Schott. "I've always
been able to talk to my parents and
to take advice from them. They let
me lead my own life and make my
own decisions, while supporting
me no matter what I do. I've re¬

ally modeled my life after them,
she says. Catherine is also really
close to her brother Justin who is
in the Air Force.
The pair is always there to
check up on each other and offer
constructive criticism. In addition
to playing volleyball and being a
member of Alpha Lambda Delta,
Catherine is a member of ALLIES
and the Spanish club. Last year
she took partin the survivor's train
ing course.
After completing 12 hours
of volunteering at a shelter, in ad
dition to the 48 class hours already
completed, Catherine will be a
certified domestic violence and
rape counselor. "It was a really
good class to take," explains
Catherine, "I gained a lot of im
portant knowledge." This knowl
edge epitomizes Catherine's desire

This is no "Bull"

Before reading the follow
ing article, you may want to brace
yourself for information that may
be unsuitable for dedicated basket
ball fans. If you have trouble with
the graphic content of this article,
please turn your paper lo another
page, and try to refrain from in
tense emotional public outbursts.
Okay, here it is... Michael
Jordan had surgery.
Yes, all the rumors are true.
Michael Jordan, perhaps the great
est basketball player of all time,
is in stable condition after having
two ingrown toenails removed. (If
you didn't catch the sarcasm there,
there was some intended.)
Jordan the NBA's nine time
scoring champ, will miss the last
remaining Chicago Bulls pre
season games against Philadelphia
on Wednsday, Philadelphia again
on Friday, and lastly Saturday
against Sacramento.

Jordan though thoroughly
traumatized by the incident said,
"It was decided that it was better
for me to have the toenails re
moved now and thus be ready for
the opening of the season. I'm
looking forward to being back on
the court next week and starting

the defense of our championship.
"What does Jordan think he
is doing anyway? He is not al
lowed to go and get hurt. He is
the only reason that half the fans
watch professional basketball any
way. When people turn on the TV,
they do not want to see "Thunder"
Bob Thorton shooting a two
handed jumper over Kurt
Nymphius.
They want to see " slam,
bam, I'm gonna shoot, dribble,
dunk, stuff, turn,pass, twist, glide,
and sail right past you and you are
going to like it" Michael Jordan.
As far as alot of professional
basketball fans are concerned
there should be a some kind . of
NBA regulation against Michael
Jordan having surgery. Something
in his contract that would read:
"Michael is not allowed to partici
pate in any surgical procedure or
medical practice no matter the se
verity of injury because frankly he
is too damn important to the

I mean hey, when reading
the contract Michael would be so
distracted by the number three and
the seven zeros that follow it (in
the salary paragraph) that the little
clause about "no surgery" may be
somewhat insignificant.
Many people would pay no

attention to a clause like the one
above, if right next to it, the para
graph read: "We will pay you $30
MILLION dollars for one season."
Would you read over it? Me too.
Have no fear. This time,
luckily, Jordan will be suited up
and ready to play in the season
opener on October 31. It will take
about two weeks for Jordan's "toe
sy, woe-sies to get all better" and
then he will be back to continue
on with the professional basketball
dynasty that has become the Chi
cago Bulls.

If you are a basketball fan,
and you read through the entire
article then you are to be com
mended and congratulated. As
hard as it was to write, it was even
harder to read as the truth.
So, don't let this article get
into the wrong hands or mass
histeria could break out all over
campus. Jordan will be back, and
hopefully the loss of a few extra
pieces of toenail will not throw off
his game. Oh yeah, that is right,
Jordan shoots over guys a foot
taller than him... I don't think he'll
be having any problems.

Who will be back at Homecoming to see Tom Olchon make
spectacular plays like this at homecoming? Has homecoming
lost it's luster?


Home Sweet Gettysburg

By Josh Eyler
Assistant Sports Editor

the high school dances and the se
niors that I knew last year who will
be returning, but most of all I think
about the football game that ev
eryone attended religiously to
cheer on the team. The Home
coming Game was a monument,
an institution, I know that many
people feel the same way.
However, no one embraces
these feelings more deeply than
the football alumni that will return
this weekend to watch their Bul
lets play once again. These men
get to come "home" to visit the
field where they bled, dripped
sweat, won, and lost. At the time
it was everything to them.
Now, it is just a fond
memory. Who, that once put on
the pads and helmets, will return
this weekend? Perhaps those
players who are now famous will
return, such as Pete Draovitch,
who is the personal trainer for the
tremendous golfer Greg Norman
or Scott Dudak, who is getting in-

Yesterday I began to think
about Homecoming and what it
means here at Gettysburg. First, I
pulled out my dusty old Webster's
Dictionary, and one of the defini
tions for the word homecoming
was "an annual celebration for
alumni at a college or university."
In the most basic sense, that is ex
actly what will happen this week
end. More importantly, though,
homecoming is defined as "a re
turn home." For many of the
alumni that will return this week
end, Gettysburg is the home of the
memories that they hold dearest to
their hearts. This is where they
made the friends that have lasted
a lifetime and where they had the
type of good times that can never
be retrieved.
When I personally think
about homecoming, I remember

ducted into Gettysburg's Hall of
Honor this weekend.
Maybe the long list of awe
some captains will be at good old
Musselman Stadium to watch
their team: those such as Rod
Albright, Bryant "The Bulldog"
Meckley, Harry Cooper, and Chris
Notarfrancesco. By chance, even
the unsung heroes may return,
such as Chuck Seidenstricker, who
played in the trenches from '68 to
72, or John Buskirk, who played
all four years despite the fact that
he had two major knee surgeries.
Personally, I hope that they
all come. I hope that they take as
much joy in watching this year's
Bullets pound the Mules from
Muhlenberg as they once had
when they themselves were wear
ing the orange and blue. But most
of all I hope that Homecoming for
these guys, as well as all of the
alumni, is a special one, because
"returning home" should always
be a meaningful experience.

College wins
court battle

Haaland says tenure process
working well
A federal jury ruled in favor of Gettysburg College in
a discrimination lawsuit filed by a former professor who was
denied tenure.
Kelfala Kallon was a tenure-tack professor in
Gettysburg's economics department from 1987 until he was
denied tenure in the fall of 1992.
Kallon, a black man originally from Sierra Leone, was
unable to prove hisxlaims that he was denied tenure from
Gettysburg due to his race and national origin. He sought
back pay and compensatory damages.
Kallon, now a U. S. citizen, is currently a tenured
professor at the University of Northern Colorado.
Gettysburg College evaluates its professors for tenure
based on three separate criteria: teaching, research, and gov
ernance. Professors are evaluated for tenure by their aca
demic departments, the Faculty Personnel Committee, and
the President of the College.
College attorneys argued that Kallon was denied ten
ure because he failed to meet the College's standards for
teaching. He had received unsatisfactory evaluations from
students in his classes, which play a significant role in the
tenure process.

Kallon's attorneys claimed that Kallon had been de
nied tenure while white professors of similar ability were
approved for tenure. It was also suggested that the negative
evaluations given by the students may have been racially
motivated.
Much of the testimony in the week-long trial was cen
tered around the various intricacies of the College's tenure
process. Numerous documents were introduced as evidence
for the cases of both the defense and the prosecution.
Several Gettysburg College faculty members were
called to testify about the tenure process in general, and how
it related to Kallon.
Kallon himself spent nearly four hours on the witness
stand last Wednesday, in a very emotional testimony. Kallon
broke into tears many times while discussing the mental
anguish he suffered from the College's refusal to grant him
tenure. see RULING -- page 4

Olmos to show "We're all in the same gang"

Courtesy of The Fall Convocation
Committee Growing up in the East Los Ange
les barrio, barely escaping the violent vi
cious cycle of gang life, Edward James
Olmos went on to become a role model
to many people. He was able to achieve
this by succeeding on his own terms and
making his own choices. Olmos will be
the featured speaker at Fall Convocation
on November 13 at 11:30 a.m. in the
Chapel. Fall Convocation is a time to
arouse the intellect and challenge us to
reflect on both the realities of the world
as well as our own commitment towards
making a difference. Each year a presti
gious speaker is brought to Gettysburg
College to help raise our consciousness
of existing social issues.
Although he is most well known
for his role as Lt. Castillo on Miami Vice,
that is not his greatest accomplishment.
Olmos has dedicated years of his life try
ing to educate people. He is the ambassa
dor of UNICEF and sits on the board of

"Rebuild Los Angeles. " The unofficial
mayor of L.A., Olmos has worked to re
store the city's grief stricken neighborhoods
following the 1992 riots. He has also been
actively involved in bringing food to
Mexico's impoverished Mayan Indians.
Olmos is considered one of the
United States' most visible spokespersons
for the Hispanic Community. Mr. Olmos
comes to Gettysburg College advocating
education of the public in order to reduce
violence. With every word, he delivers the
message of self-discipline and determina
tion can overcome even the most daunting
obstacles. A number of programs will take
place leading up to Olmos' visit to
Gettysburg College, continuing into the
night of November 13 and in the days

CORRECTION
Last week's article
"College sued for discrimina
tion" incorrectly reported that
the FPC recommended Pro
fessor Kallon for tenure when
in fact the Faculty Personnel
Committee decided against
granting Professor Kallon ten
ure. It was the Grievance
Committee of the Faculty, not
the President, who told Pro
fessor Charles "Buzz" Myers
to withdraw his grievance be
cause he had new information
to be considered in the grant
ing of tenure rather than a
grievance on procedural mat
ters. The Gettysburgian re
grets these unfortunate errors.

RULING — from p

The verdict in the case was
decided by the eight-member all
white jury ofthe U.S. Middle Dis
trict Court, despite the request of
College attorney Elizabeth
Dougherty to have Judge Sylvia
Rambo make the ruling due to lack
of evidence on the part of Kallon
and his attorneys.
The jury ruled in favor ofthe
defense, in apparent agreement with
Dougherty's suggestion that Kallon
was unable to show evidence that
any racial bias existed.
Stacey Schmeidel, Director
of Public Relations for the College
was pleased with the decision. "We
were confident from the beginning
that this had nothing to do with race
or national origin," she told the
Hanover Evening Sun.
Gettysburg College President
Gordon Haaland was also pleased
with the results of the case. He
stated that there was "absolutely no
problem," with the way the College
handles the tenure process. He
called the College's procedures in

evaluating professors for tenure
"clear and strong."
"This [decision] will rein
force, positively, the way we handle
the issue, and strengthen the role of
the Faculty Personnel Committee,"
said Haaiand.
Haaland also stated that he

felt the College's current method of
student evaluation was working,
though he acknowledged that "some
departments do a better job than oth
ers." Kallon still has the opportu
nity to appeal the decision.

Linnaean winners announced
from staff reports
The winners of the 1997-98 Linnaean Awards were announced
this Saturday during half-time at the Homecoming football game.
The Awards, given annually to six members ofthe graduat
ing class, were presented to seniors Erin Attfield, Jill Bailey, Ben
Barnhart, Joe Hodakowski, Abigail Rodgers, and Brian Rusignuolo.
Each year, students are nominated for the awards by faculty,
administrators, and other students for their leadership, academic work,
and community service. Students then vote for their peers among the
nominees.
The history of the Linnaean Awards dates back to one of the
earliest organizations on Gettysburg's campus, the Linnaean Asso
ciation, founded in 1844. The Association was founded for the pur
pose of the advancement of science. The Linnaean Awards attempt to
recapture the spirit of this organization by honoring students whose
actions inspire other students.

Featu res
zoinksh! G-G-G-GHOSTS!!!

by Cara Masucci
Staff Writer As Halloween approaches
every year, it seems as though
we all want to be scared. We
watch scary movies, tell fright
ening stories, and most of all,
talk about ghosts. Nowhere is
this more apparent than here in
Gettysburg College. Since it is
a very old, historic town,
Gettysburg has a rich tradition
of ghosts; our campus is no dif
ferent. When a tourist comes into
Gettysburg and stops you to ask
where the battlefields are lo
cated, your first instinct might be
to point in the direction of the
Visitor Center. If you were go
ing to be more precise, you'd tell
the tourist that they are standing
on them.

All of Gettysburg was a
battlefield during the Civil War,
so almost every inch of ground
has seen bloodshed or loss of
life. This has led to numerous
haunted buildings on campus.
At the time of the Civil
War, there were three buildings
on the campus of the college
then known as Pennsylvania
College. One of the buildings
was Penn Hall. Since it was a
large building , it was used as a
hospital for injured soldiers.
Many men died inside
Pennsylvania Hall, and there
were never enough doctors. In
fact, a few years ago several col
lege administrators were greeted
with a sight they knew they
would never forget.
Around dusk the adminis
trators decided it was time to go
home. They headed toward the
elevator and pushed the button
to get off on the first floor. They
were greeted with quite a shock
when they passed the first floor
and headed towards the base¬

ment. As the doors opened, leg
end has it that, they saw a Civil
War doctor who tried to get them

involved in the war effort. Quickly
pressing the button for the first
floor, they were beckoned more and
more. Just as the doctor was about
to reach the elevator door, the doors
closed and the administrators were
finally able to leave.
Another famous ghost is the
ghost of Glatfelter Hall. There are

all the way Stevens. The women
living there felt sorry for him and
decided to take him in. However,
the house mother heard stories of
this, and came up to the room on
the third floor to investigate.
Frantic, the girls let him out
side their window onto the ledge.

two different versions of what hap
pened to her, and what brought
about her leap from the y
belltower. /
One version of the /
story is that a woman /
was so distraught by / '
the loss of her fiance /
during the Spanish- / ' *
American War that / ' '" " '
she threw herself
off the hell tower to

an untim_^Jy death.
She now beckons
young women to
come jump with
her late at /
night. A
The fM

other most
told version of
the story is
that she and
her fiance
were not al
lowed to be
t o -
g*r _^_v
he- _kSfei

cause her father disapproved of the
match. They both decided to jump
together, but at the last minute, he
chickened out and she died without
him. In this version, it is the males
who are beckoned to jump with her.
It is a way of getting back at her
lover who refused to jump with her.
Another extremely famous
ghost story is that of the Blue Boy
of Stevens Hall. As one version of
the story goes, a young boy from
an orphanage ran away and made it

The house mother lectured them
for a long time, and as soon as they
were able, they opened the window
to let the small child in. However,
the boy was not there. They ran
down the stairs to look on the
ground beneath their window, fear
ful of finding his body there. But
there was nothing there. No body.
No print.
As legend goes, on cold,
wintery nights, girls in that room
have heard tapping at the window,

Looking up, she will see a blue
face at the window, and in the frost
are the words, "Help me."
Stevens is the oldest dorm
on campus. One ghost is not
nearly enough. There is another
ghost haunting the third floor of
the dorm. It is the ghost of a girl
who lived there once. More than
nnp. resident nf Stp.ve.ns has

opened the door to her
room onlv to _^ _-*

/ / variably runs to

Another aca
demic building that is
haunted is Brua Hall,

home to the theater depart
ment. The ghost there
Vk is known as

whether the ghost was a real gen
eral at all. Theater students have
told of rehearsing on the stage of
Kline late at night, alone, look
ing up towards the light booth, and
seeing a figure dressed in Civil
War attire looking down at the
stage. Stevens, the lab theater, is
also quite haunted. As students

Street. These are the famous ghosts
of Gettysburg College. But since
the battle was everywhere, it only
makes sense that ghosts are every
where. One of the lesser known
ghosts on campus is the ghost of
Rice Hall.
Affectionately named
Daniel, he is known as a friendly
ghost. One day the resident of the
room decided she needed sleep.
Instead of getting up to pull down
the shades, she just decided to roll
over. When she woke up, the
shades were down, and her room
mate had not been there all after
noon. This could only be attrib
uted to Daniel .
He has been known to turn
off the girls' alarm clocks, and turn
on the television without any
prompting. Doors will fly open
when there is no wind, and one
unfortunate male stumbled across
him in the bathroom early one
morning while taking a shower.
Dressed in a Civil War uniform
with dark features, he drove the
guy right out of the bathroom.
Whether real of fake, ghosts
bring something to the campus. A
sense of history and connection
with that events occurred here over
one hundred years ago. As Hal
loween approaches this weekend,
these stories will intensify, and
brings lots of fun to many college
students. Who knows? Maybe
you'll come across one of the
ghosts of Gettysburg College.



In Case You Missed It
Mutant plant sings, dances, entertains

by Steve Spicer
Copy Editor Everyone needs a plant or
two in his room, but not one like
the Audrey II.
Being carnivorous, such a
"strange and interesting plant"
could never make it in a dorm
room, but place the overgrown
vegetable in the middle of a re
make of a remake and you've got
a surefire hit.
The story line behind Little
Shop of Horrors is an old one. It
was germinated in 1960 by Roger
Corman. Then it bloomed again
in 1980 and was made into an Off
Broadway musical.
However, the story didn't
come to full fruition until 1986

when Warner Brothers picked
up the script and handed it to
director Frank Oz.
No two versions of Little
Shop are quite the same. This
variant, the big screen transla
tion of a musical, is uproari
ously funny.
The reason this film is so
good is due to the phenomenal
cast that was gathered.
Rick Moranis
(Spaceballs, Honey, I Shrunk
the Kids ) plays Seymour
Krelborn, the poor, orphaned
misfit who lives in the basement
of Mushnik_'s Flower Shop
where he also works.
Ellen Greene reprises her
stage role of Audrey, Seymour's

love interest. Her high, squeaky
voice lends itself perfectly to her
ditziness.
Throughout the film, many
stars such as Bill Murray, John
Candy and James Belushi appear
in hysterical cameo roles.
The true star of Little Shop,
however, is the Audrey II. Levi
Stubbs, one of the original Four
Tops, lends his voice to the plant.
His vocal capacity, coupled with
a talented special effects team,
bring this "mean, green mother"
to life.
Another enjoyable aspect to
this movie is the music. From the
fast tempo of the title song to the
climactic moment of "Suddenly
Seymour," the songs amuse, and

move the audience.
The film opens with the om
nipresent do-wop girls, Crystal,
Chiffon and Ronette, singing a warn
ing to all.
The plot quickly advances to
Seymour and Audrey singing the
woes of life on Skid Row. The same
money troubles that keep Audrey
and Seymour trapped on Skid Row
also threaten to close Mushnik's
Flower Shop.
Seymour spends his time pin
ing away for Audrey as she dreams
of life in a suburbian home, com
plete with a white picket fence.
In an attempt to persuade the
owner, Mr. Mushnik, not to close the
store for good, Seymour places one
of his "strange and interesting"
plants, which he has named the
Audrey II, in the window.
Immediately, the customers
begin pouring in to gawk at the odd
ity.

As Seymour soon discovers,
though, there's a slight catch. His
cute little plant refuses to get big
ger. Seymour accidentally finds the
necessary food for his plant.
In order to grow, the Audrey
II requires an odd type of fertilizer:
blood. The vampire-vegetable's thirst
soon increases to the point where
Seymouris forced to "perform mu
tilations" in order to continue the
growth of both the plant and his
fame. The most memorable victim is
Audrey's boyfriend, Orin Scrivello,

D.D.S., the motorcycle-riding ,
leather-clad, sadistic dentist who
is portrayed perfectly by Steve
Martin {The Jerk, Parenthood).
Every scene containing
Martin is a must-see. As the char
acters in the movie say, he is a "to
tal disgrace to the dental profes
sion," After the Audrey II con
vinces Seymour that "the guy sure
looks like plant food to me,"
Seymour goes to Scrivello's office
expecting to have to kill him, but
instead the dentist overdoses on
nitrous oxide as Seymour looks on.
How convenient!

Apparently the good doctor
has a habit of getting lambasted
before any procedure he performs.
The Audrey II eats the now
defunct dentist but is still hungry.
Eventually, after the overgrown
squash devours a few more char
acters, Audrey II decides to snack
on its namesake, the real Audrey.
Since by this point Seymour
and Audrey (the woman, not the
plant) are planning on getting mar
ried and running off together,
Seymour has to confront the hor
ticultural nightmare to make a
clean escape.

I can't in good faith divulge
the shocking ending. If you want
to know what happens, you'll just
have to get this movie and see for
yourself.
I highly recommend this
flick for one of those goofy nights.

Brusque Brits

It his been an interesting
time to be in Britain. First of
course was the death of the Prin
cess of Wales; this contributed
greatly to the on-going saga of the
royal family. (Personally, I think
the Queen was in a lose-lose situ
ation: had she publicly expressed
grief, she would have been called
a hypocrite; by keeping silent, she
was called cold.)
Then there was the "yes"
votes on devolution; first in Scot
land, then in Wales. For Scotland,
this means a significant measure
of self-government free from
London. Wales will have some
what less freedom of action than
Scotland, but more than it had
before. Some believe this is the
final phase of the end of the Brit
ish Empire.

by Mark Berg
Contribut' ng Writer

And there is the continuing
discussion of whether or not col
leges and universities in England
should remain free for all who at
tend. The Labour government has
proposed charging students and
students across the nation are up
in arms; there will be a demon
stration at the University of Essex
on November 1.
Imagine! The government
wants to charge $ 1,600 per year
to attend!! Some students may
even have to take out loans!! Per
haps you at Gettysburg would like
to stage a protest in support.
But the most striking im
pression I have of England is their
approach to customer service.
Though approach is not exactly
the right word; avoidance may be
a bit more accurate.

For example, we went into
a bakery and coffee shop in
Greenwich to buy some scones.
There were four clerks and two
waitresses behind the bakery
counter. We stood about three feet
away and waited; perhaps they
were resolving some problem.
We waited a little longer;
they continued their discussion.
Finally I said, "Could someone
please sell us some scones?" With
a look of annoyance, one of the
clerks did, without so much as a
"Thank you."
Another example: I went to
the Museum of the City of Lon
don late one afternoon and asked
to see the remnant of a gate and

guard tower from the Roman
walls. The museum building
straddles the site of the walls, so
you have to ask to be taken to a
large basement containing the rem
nant. The attendant told me,
"Sorry, it can only be seen one the
first and last Tuesday of every
month."
When I pointed out that it
was, in fact, the first Tuesday of
the month, he was crestfallen, but
he did summon a guard to take me.
While waiting, I apologized for
coming so late in the day (the Mu
seum was open another hour), and
he replied, "Actually, you can only
see it in the morning."
Too bad he had forgotten
Plan B until it was too late to stop
me.

Last example: We went to a
Victorian lunch room one day in
Dublin (to show that bad service
isn't merely an English trait), went
through the line, and went to the
cashier. At that moment, the cash
ier, second cashier, and what
looked like a manager were hav
ing an animated discussion.
We waited; perhaps they
were resolving some problem or
another. We waited a little longer.
Finally I shrugged my shoulders
and raised my hands palm up as if
to say, "So?" Whcn_^^^^_M
the manager final _ly_^^^^^^
looked over, I com-_^^^^^_f
mented, "We're what_^^^^^_f
is known as" custom-_^^H_^H
ers.'" The cashieil^^|^^
cheerfully said _. _HMIHHB

"Sorry," as the man
ager glared at me.
Now you might
say these could be
isolated examples,
and that you could
just as easily point to
similar experiences in
Gettysburg. I don't
think so. And don't
get me wrong, we're
having a great time.
The Brits are warm,
friendly people—as
long as they don't
have to wait on you.

Reel Hits & Misses—

Pucker up, Casanova

by Jon Froehlich
Staff Writer

critics might attempt to fit it in.
Much of the movie's suc
cess lies on the shoulders of Alex
Cross, played by Morgan Freeman
{Driving Miss Daisy, The
Shawshank Redemption). His
smooth but sharp manner that of
ten makes him so appealing to au
diences works well for him in this
role.

"He's a real student of the
game . . .And he loves to play."
said Alex Cross.
Forensic psychologist Alex
Cross is the kind of guy that has a
knack for knowing things about
people, almost before they know
it themselves.
The plot of Kiss the Girls
kicks in when that distance is shat
tered after a serial abductor call
ing himself Casanova makes the
game personal for Cross by tak
ing his niece, Naomi, played by
Gina Rivera (Soul Food).
Though audiences may
feel that this basic framework is
like that of a typical cop movie,
this assumption only rings true
to a certain extent.
For one, whether people
are quick to admit it or not,
movies about revenge bent cops/
tough guys out on personal mis
sions to catch the bad guy are usu
ally entertaining and offer plots
that have, and will continue to,
draw in eager viewers.

Movies such as Out for Jus
tice, starring Steven Seagal and
others like it will forever satisfy
many viewers on some level.
Secondly, Kiss the Girls is
a little bigger than the mold that

Tonight only partially
succeeds in being different, Kiss
the Girls must be given credit for
trying to break away from many
of the cliches that aren't so easily
avoided when making a police
mystery movie.
For example, Casanova
took Cross's niece. Director Gary
Fleder (Things To Do in Denver
When You're Dead) could have
just as easily given into tempta
tion and made Cross's daughter
disappear, but he didn't.

Though simply a difference
of one branch on the Cross family
tree, this decision nevertheless
shows a deviation from the nor
mal cop movie blueprint.
As Kiss the Girls takes on
a personal tone for Cross, it soon
becomes as personal as is possible
with its viewers when Casanova
grabs Kate McTeirnan.
Played well by Ashley Judd
(Smoke, A Time to Kill, Sisters),
Kate is one of the only characters
besides Cross that the movie has
allowed audiences to really
"know."
I In the character of Kate,
Judd offers a defiant and on-tar
get performance that audiences
can easily appreciate.
A movie with many of the
same shadowy qualities as Seven
(which also stars Morgan Free
man), Kiss the Girls, though noth
ing strikingly new, offers an ex
citing well-paced plot with char
acters that seem deeply connected
to the story and to each other.

Concluding with a battle
between two men who have made
their lives out of getting into other
people's heads, Kiss the Girls will
not leave viewers disappointed.




Go speed racer... But keep it clean

by Kyle Heulitt
GECO Columnist
The car industry has been
pressured for years to produce
cleaner automobiles. Each com
pany has been working intensely
to be the first to find the perfect
fuel-efficient, pollution-free car of
the future, and the public is just re
cently beginning to see the fruits
of their labor.
The week Honda unveiled its
lower-emission vehicle, which has
a device in the exhaust system that
changes pollutants into less toxic
substances like water and carbon
dioxide.
This car reduces noxious
emissions to one-tenth the level of
the world's toughest emissions
standard set by the California Air
Resources Board. The new engine
could be in production in less than
two years.

Although Honda s new ve
hicles seem to be the most practi
cal and soon to be available right
now, the most promising technolo
gies for the future seem to be the
fuel cell, the electric car, and the
hybrid.
The fuel cell is able to power
electric cars without the need for
bulky batteries. It converts the
chemical energy of fuels into elec
tric and thermal energy, and the

only exhaust it produces is pure
water and a small amount of heat.
This car is able to run on
ethanol, methanol, natural gas,
and recently, a U.S. government
industry team demonstrated one
that can use gasoline.
Each of these fuels could

easily
r e -
place
gaso
line at
t h e
pumps and keep the ex
isting
net
works of gas
sta
tions intact.
I n

May 1996, in Berlin, Germany's
Daimler-Benz AG unveiled the
NECAR 3, and became the first
major international car maker to
unveil a fuel cell powered pas
senger car. This particular car
runs on methanol.
Another type of car that
will be utilized in the future is the

electric car. In the past these cars
were small and inconvenient, but
car makers are finding new ways
to bring them up to the level of
today's gasoline cars.
Toyota's RAV4-EV, an elec
tric sports utility vehicle, will re
tail this fall (exclusively to busi¬

nesses)
for about $42,000.
It has a
range _0 f
about 1 3 0
miles before r e -
charge is nec
essary.
R e -
charg
i n g

takes 8
hours and can be done from a 220
volt electric line. Its maximum
speed is electronically limited to 78
miles per hour.
One more type of promising
technology is the hybrid vehicle,
which has both an electric and
gasoline engine. It has the advan
tages of the gasoline engine with

none of the disadvantages of elec
tric cars.
The hybrid engine has an
automatic power-split device in
the transmission that allows it to
use an electric motor in low speed
driving, and cut to a gas engine for
higher speeds, supplying extra en
ergy and recharging the batteries.
Also, the gas engine never
idles, which is where the most en
ergy is wasted. Instead, the en
gine remains off until extra power
is needed.
Toyota plans to retail its hy
brid, named the Prius, in Japan
starting on December 10, for
about $22,000. GM, Ford,
Chrysler, Volkswagen, and
Renault are also pursuing hybrid
cars. In Kyoto, Japan, on Decem
ber 1, there will be a meeting of
representatives of governments
from around the world to discuss
the threat of global warming.

This meeting will undoubt
edly force the auto industry to be
come environmentally friendly,
and put earth-friendly cars on the
market. Hopefully we will see
these cars for sale in a few years.
GECO meets every Thurs
day at 7 p.m. at the GECO office
in the basement of Plank Gym. All
are welcome!!!


Sour
Apple?

by Casey Dunn
Staff Writer

Fiona Apple is a name that
is becoming more and more
prominent, especially here at
Gettysburg College.
As I began to listen to her
album, I was expecting something
spectacular in her music. What I
found was a talented musician, but
one much like everyone else.
Her debut album, Tidal, was
written by Apple. At age 19,
younger than half the student
population here on campus, she
had become a prominent figure in
the music industry, and I assumed
it was because of earth shattering
music. After listening to her CD I
realized I was wrong.
Her music resembles much
of what is popular today, espe
cially in the female music indus
try. She is similar to many of her
contemporaries in the style of
music she plays and in the image
she portrays: an image of an "or
dinary" girl making a name for
herself in a male dominated world
and industry.

Her faster songs, with a lot
of guitar, are a shade less bitter
than Alanis Morrisette and sound
almost identical to that Joan
Osborne. Other songs reminded
me of Jewel.
My favorite songs on the
CD were the ones accompanied by
piano, sounding almost like Tori
Amos, but with a lot less flare and
emotion. The song
"Shadowboxer" was by far my
favorite, with its piano-in-a-small
bar-on-the-corner type feel. In my
opinion, this particular song was
the most unique and revealed a lot
of her talent.
I found the CD to be one that
was enjoyable to listen to, and
even found myself humming
along to some of the tunes. She
does display a tremendous amount
of talent, but her music did not
seem groundbreaking to me.

I began to wonder what
makes her so popular, and decided
it is the image she portrays as a
young female. Her image gives
hope to those who aspire to "make
it" in the music industry. In es
sence she is the icon of possibil
ity.


Dear Casey...

Dear Casey,
I am rather bummed be
cause my parents took my car
away and are letting my brother
have it at his campus. This has
forced me to give up my off-cam
pus job and limited my mobil
ity. There is no way I can get a
car by myself, and I am rather
bitter about this loss. Is there
anything I can do?
Carless
Dear Carless,
It does seem rather unfair
that you lost your car to your
brother, but it is probable that your
parents had their reasons. I would
not attempt to squander your
money on buying a lemon. Instead
I would attempt to make lemon
ade. Seeing as the campus and
town is not too expansive, it
should be relatively easy for you
to get around without wheels, and
enjoy the scenery as well.

As for your job, try getting
one on campus, it will most likely
save you lots of time and energy
you could be using in other con
structive activities.
In general, I would like you
to know that the loss of a car is
not the end of the world and that
you are just going to have to learn
to get about without it.
There could be many more
terrible things that could happen,

Howard in Gettysburg by Myles Price

and even though the situation is a
real bummer, things could be
worse.
And, if just sitting back and
accepting things is not your style,
try constructively convincing your
parents that you need the car. Do
not try to use guilt trips and the
such, because they usually do not
hold water with parents.
Perhaps, if you can defend
the argument that you need the car
more than your sibling, you might
be able to retrieve it. If not, try

not to hold a grudge, or you might
be carless for a much longer time.
Dear Casey,
Just recently I found out
that people who I thought were
my "friends" were talking about
me behind my back. I acci
dently overheard a conversation
in which they were complaining
about me. They don't know
that I overheard them and still
treat me like a friend. I cannot
believe that my "friends" would
be so two-faced. What should I
do?

Feeling Friendless
Dear Feeling Friendless,
This seems to be a sticky
situation, but my best advice is to
stand up for yourself and do not
let your friends walk over you like
an old throw rug.
The last thing anyone needs

are shallow friends who just keep
you around to complain about you.
It is sad, but true. Perhaps over
hearing their conversation can be
seen as a good thing, because now
you know where you really stand.
You should definitely let
them know that you heard what
they said, and do not let them try
to apologize or explain their way
out of it. Let them know how you
feel and leave it at that.
It is really self-defeating if
you keep friends around who are
two-faced. You can certainly do
better than them. True friends do
not maliciously rag on their
friends to others, even though
sometimes friendship ties can be
strained.
Do not allow yourself to be
treated with anything less than re
spect. This is often hard to do, es
pecially in this age of exploitation
and the such where everyone
thinks they can walk over anyone
they want.

You re at an awkward point
in life. You want to feel popular;
nobody wants to sit in Servo alone.
But this doesn't mean you should
sacrifice your self-respect. Your
"friends" are the jerks here, not
you. You need to remember that.
So I say, stand up and de
fend yourself. After you do, move
on and do not dwell on them any
longer. After all, are they really
worth your time and energy?

by John Dunlap
Staff Writer Last Sunday's victory by the
Florida Marlins in the World Se
ries was very representative of the
changes effecting Major League
Baseball today. America's national
pastime is undergoing a process of
historic change. Change, that in
my opinion, is dragging the entire
sport down from the big leagues
to the little leagues.
It could easily be said that
baseball is a business, and as an
ideological conservative I should
allow the sport adapt to the chang
ing times. In other words, the own
ers and the players should be left
to handle matters on their own. For
the most part, they should be al
lowed, however there are some
cases when government should
step in and protect the national in
terest.

In 1981, when Harley
Davidson was near death because
of Japanese competition, President
Ronald Reagan stepped in and
moved away from his devout free
trade positions to support tariffs to
save America's great motorcycle.
This was not exactly a capitalist
position having the government
come in and influence the buying
and selling of goods, but it was the
right thing to do. Certain traditions
are timeless and should never be
allowed to either die or face rapid
demise. Baseball today is under-

There are too many cars here
at Gettysburg. Not only are there
too many cars, but there is always
one in my space.
The parking problem is
worst in the lots in College Apart
ments, Paxton Hall, and Huber/
Patrick/_Musselman/Stevens Halls.
The people who live in these
dormitories and apartments should

going a great deal of demise. What
acting Commissioner Bud Selig,
club owners, and the player's
unions are doing is wrong. Fore
most wrong for fan.
Under Mr. Selig's acting
leadership, and that is all it is, and
his predecessor, Fay Vincent's tra
ditions which have lasted for al
most a century are being broken.
Some traditions are meant to be de
stroyed like Jackie Robinson's his
toric breaking of the color barrier
fifty years ago but some traditions
should remain timeless. Baseball
can not cater to primetime enter
tainment interests by having the
New York Yankees and Mets play
one another because it could be a
great promotional game. One is in
the American League and one in
the National League. Baseball is
the only sport where after the pre
season you do not see your possible
World Series opponent until the
World Series itself. That is now
being changed.

In the early part of this de
cade, Mr. Vincent realigned the
Leagues and then it was done again
to create an extra level of playoffs,
to have wildcard team and have the
playoff hunt go longer. That may
mean more money but it destroys
traditions, it cheapens the game.
Less and less children are playing
Little League and that spells
trouble down the road for baseball.
With less talent what will baseball

get first priority. For example,
there are off-campus dwelling stu
dents who still have their Gettys
burg College parking sticker and
park in College Apartments, com
pletely ticket-free.
You don't practice hula
dancing. You either can or you
can't. I have a feeling you can, but
Dan says you can't.

then have to do, go to aluminum
bats because people are too bored
to watch a pitchers' duel.
The sport of baseball is a
mind game and, maybe, by mov
ing a team to a suburb and having
more horneruns will be able to at
tract a larger baseball illiterate
crowd. However, by doing that you
forget about the people who love
baseball for what it is, a sport that
has no shot clocks and no timeouts,
a sport where you have to be think
ing about every pitch, every run
ner and every possible pitcher to
hitter match up.
This most recent World Se
ries was representative of the fu
ture over how a five year old ball

club could be pieced together with
86 million dollars worth of play
ers to win a World Series. Now
that they have won that champion
ship they will probably be sold and
the players be traded off to save
money. What ever happened to the
teams who drafted a player and
watched him become a star like
Mike Schmidt of the Philadelphia
Phillies or Cal Ripken Jr. of the
Baltimore Orioles. Ripken was
born and raised in suburban Balti
more, as a kid he cheered for the
Orioles, now day after day he is
on the field playing for that team.
It would never happen, but free
agency should be done away with.
It has made the game one of the
dollar. Some players have resisted

There shouldn't be restric
tions on visiting friends in these
domiciles, but a policy similar to
the one in Masters parking lot
would be useful. Between 2 and 6
am, only residents of the appropri
ate dormitories should be allowed
to park in the lot. This would prac
tically guarantee the dorm deni
zens a parking spot right outside

but most do not, and maybe they
cannot be blamed. Free Agency
is forcing the American and Na
tional Leagues two central divi
sions to be the mediocre divisions
where players are raised so that the
East and West Coast can buy them
away. The Cleveland Indians over
came that and without Albert Bell,
who was bought away buy the
highest bidder, this year they came
within one run of winning the
World Series.
Granted perhaps what I want
can never occur, the chances of
going back are virtually nonexist
ent. If I could go back I would
have never wanted baseball to ex
pand into Canada with the
Montreal Expos and the Toronto
Blue Jays. Nothing against
Canada but the USA's sport should
not extend outside of our great bor
ders

In my dream world we
would have no designated hitter,
and the job of an American League
Manager would be as tough as the
job of a National League Manager
We could also put Pete Rose in the
Baseball Hall of Fame where he
belongs. It is wrong that the all
time hit king and the greatest util
ity player in the history of the game
is not in Cooperstown with the
other greats of baseball. Lastly, we
could have Jim Leyland win a
World Series with a team who de
served to win it but could not com-

the door instead of a long walk
away. Won't somebody please
think of the children?
If black boxes are always
inspected after plane crashes, why
isn't the entire plane made out of
the black box material?
One of the best things about
baseball is that we agree to dis¬

r
rates

pete financially, the Pittsburgh Pi
. Baseball needs a Commis
sioner who understands tradition
and the history of the sport'. Some
one who will fight to keep the
teams where they are. Baseball
should not be like the NFL where
the New York Giants and Jets play
in New Jersey. The New York Yan
kees should stay in New York, pref
erably in the Bronx. Baseball
needs someone who appreciates
history and traditions, the kind of
history of tradition that can be felt
by going into the Baseball Hall'of
Fame and visiting Doubleday Field
in Cooperstown, New York.
Baseball's old Leagues can not be
allowed to devolve into the East

and the West like the NBA. The
Milwaukee Brewers should stay in
the American League.
President Clinton wanted to
takeover our national health-care
system, and I do not want him to
takeover Baseball, which would
really destroy it. If the president
and Congress can somehow help
put baseball back on track, like
President Reagan did with Harley
Davidson, then for once govern
ment can do something right. Not
through legislation or executive
orders but by sitting down with all
sides and represent the silent ma
jority in this whole debate, the fans.
If not, there goes another great
American tradition.

agree. I like the designated hitter
Other people don't. But, that's
okay. That's why we have two
leagues.
What's with these people tap
dancing?

wildcard team winning the World

Public Relations Chairs - Panhel
andlFC We hope that every one en
joyed a very festive and safe
Homecoming weekend. It was
great to see our alumni again and
to root our football team on to a
fantastic victory. We also want
to congratulate the winners of this
years Linean award: Abby
Rodgers, Jill Bailey, Erin Attfield,
Ben Barnhart, Joe Hodakowski
and Brian Rusignuolo. We also
want to take this time to remind
everyone that half of this years
winners were members of Greek
organizations on campus. Abby
is a Delta Gamma, Jill is a
Gamma Phi Beta, and Brian is a
Theta Chi. Great job on repre
senting the Greek community,
maybe next year all six winners
will be Greek!

This past weekend, the
Alumni Greek Council (AGC)
met for their annual fall meeting
at Theta Chi. The AGC is the
governing body of the Greek
Alumni corporations. Some of
the topics discussed were rush,
academic performance, and of
course the BYOB policy. The

Thank you! Our best estimate is that there were 200
children trick-or-treating. Your kindness and sharing made
it a wonderful and profitable event for all those children. We
hope you enjoyed the experience as much as they did.
Incidentally, a point of interest for those of you won

Tuesday night you facilitated the creation of hundreds of
pinatas all over Adams County. Gracias!

Just a reminder to all soror
ity and first year women, there will
be a picnic in the CUB Ballroom
on Wed. October 29. It will begin
at 6:00. This is a perfect opportu
nity to come and meet new people.
Many thanks are in order to
all faculty and students who helped
support National Breast Cancer

I don't like interleague play, but the
powers-that-be believe that this
will help baseball.
The powers site statistics
about increased attendance at
interleague games, but they don't
mention the increased attendance
at regular games too.
Unanswered question from

The limits of public display

is appropriate, and what will dis

are obviously outside the bound

touching are tolerable?

There aren't any speed lim

inferiority complex while all the

him. Two of my favorite words
are juggernaut and onomatopoeia.
What does an onomatopoeia sound
like? Some onomatopoeias are
standard so they can be used in
Scrabble.

Editor's Note:
Dr. KermitFinstad's let
ter "Voice IS and instrument,"

spelling of Jonathan Blake's

grets the error.

Consider this...

According to President
Haaland, the tenure process here
at Gettysburg works.
He seems to view the
school's victory in the discrimi
nation case earlier this week as a
victory for the system currently
in place.
Many disgruntled students
would disagree as they watch their
favorite professors search for new
jobs at different schools and the
respective departments bring in
candidates to replace what
shouldn't be replaced.
Was Professor Kelfala
Kallon denied tenure because of
his race and national origin, as he
claims?
Or is he, as the College
would suggest, merely a dis
gruntled former faculty member,
blaming Gettysburg for his own
shortcomings?

While the court ruling may
serve as a legal vindication of the
College's point of view, the com
plexities of the tenure process are
such that it is nearly impossible
to resolve the question.
While President Haaland
may be justified in his belief that
the College's actions in the Kallon
case were not racially motivated,
his refusal to acknowledge the
glaring problems in the manner in
which the college handles the ten
ure process is not acceptable.
Stop and think about it: can
you clearly describe the tenure

There is no clear policy, no
patent formula employed in the
tenure process.
Perhaps this lawsuit will
serve as enough of a motivation
to prompt the administration to
implement a campus-wide set of
standards to dictate the require
ments for tenure.
Such a policy would not
only Jimit the disparities of req
uisites for tenure between each
individual department, but would
also aid both the candidate and the
Faculty Personnel Committee
(FPC) in establishing if, indeed,
the status of tenure should be
awarded. _s or

A policy such as this would
not only simplify the tenuring
process, but also provide a mea
sure of legal protection for the
College. If there existed a list of
requirements, the question of why
any candidate was refused tenure
could be quickly and easily dis
cerned.
Enough of the policies and
regulations of the College are
wrapped up in bureaucracy, the
process of insuring lifetime em
ployment should be clear and
concise. Such simplicity would
benefit all those involved ~ pro
fessors, students, and the College
itself.

Smoke 'em if you got 'em

by I.A. Isherwood
Staff Writer As of recent, I have learned
much from a class modestly (yet
accurately) entitled Colonial
American history.
As an assistant tobacconist
for a local Pittsburgh shop I have
an interest in tobacco, that blessed
plant which causes the smoker so
much pleasure, and the leftist non
smokers so much disdain. Still
though, I have become increas
ingly more annoyed at the audac
ity of our campus community in
their attitude toward the tobacco
leaf. It seems that this issue has
gone beyond just an administrative
problem, but one which might ac
tually stem from the student non
smokers in their emphatic tobacco
witch hunt.


At least once a week I am
confronted by non-smoking
Clintonites who tell me that I
should not smoke because it will
harm me in the future. I view such
comments as an insult to my (and
other smoker's) intelligence.
SMOKING KILLS! There
isn't one person on this campus
who smokes and does not know the
obvious risks of such an activity.
I do not need to be told
everytime I engage in one of my
central pleasure activities that I
might die. Now, I thank you all
for caring so much about my
health, but you need not con
sciously annoy me (and others) On
a weekly basis. I think I can edu
cate myself on such an issue.
Smoking has been a funda
mental part of American history

since the beginnings of permanent
colonization in North America.
Settlers would have long aban
doned Jamestown if not for the sot
weed (or tobacco plant).
America was built upon a
leaf, and Americans have enjoyed
such a leaf since the foundations
of our society. To quote my pro
fessor of colonial history "even the
Puritans smoked," and, truly, they
did. They loved their pipes and so
do I and many other Americans
some of whom are students at Get
tysburg College.
We need not threaten smok
ers, we need not attack them, and
we need not spit upon their leaf
like it was the most vile substance
known to man.
Oh, I have some news for
people, alcohol: in great amounts,

can kill you! Add to that, movie
theater popcorn, bacon, and
burgers which can kill you, you
don't see me walking up to some
guy at the counter of LD's and say
ing "Hey buddy, put down that
pork cause in twenty years it might
kill you." Neither should people
pester others because of their pre
ferred mode of death.
Now I am not advocating
everyone to light up or to purposely
inconvenience others by smoking.
No, With smoking comes the re
sponsibility of the smoker to be
courteous to those who do not en
joy the smell of smoke. If others,
in the past, had been responsible
with their smoking, then maybe we
would not see such an avid and stu
pid anti-smoker campaign.
I began to smoke because I

enjoyed tobacco, and I enjoyed it
so much I chose it for my part-time
college employment. It is a fasci
nating industry and honestly some
thing that many people out there
enjoy. There is nothing like hav
ing a good tobacco in a pipe, or a
nice Habana cigar. Those who pre
fer cigarettes can find so much en
joyment in a smoke after an exam
or a meal.
To the conscious smoker, to
bacco is a delightful plant for those
whom it appeals. I am one of those
people, and there is nothing wrong
with my smoking. If one wants
to smoke, and knows the eventual
ramifications of such behavior,
then let him for it is his life and
his right to do so.
We are all adults and we
need not insult each other by treat
ing smokers like children.





Conflict and Consensus

At least 15 million
Americans already
have the virus that
causes them.

Human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that
causes genital warts, is the most common sexually
transmitted disease in the United States today.
In fact, an average of 750,000 new cases of genital
warts are diagnosed each year. And it's estimated
that 11 million people who have the virus that
causes genital warts don't even know it.
Genital warts are not always obvious. They can
be small or large and appear alone or in clusters
outside or inside the body. Many genital warts
can only be found by a healthcare provider.
It's still not possible to cure HPV But, by getting
rid of the warts, healthcare providers hope to get
the virus under control. There are many types of
HPV infections, some causing external warts and
others affecting the cervix. It is important for
women to see their healthcare providers regularly
for pelvic exams and Pap smears. And, because
men and women can pass the virus to sex partners,
they should see a healthcare provider whenever
genital warts or HPV are suspected.

Genital warts don t just happen to other people.
If you notice any unusual bumps or growths in
the genital area, or if your partner has had genital
warts or HPV, see your healthcare provider.

University, "Rearrangements of
Infinite Series" - Suppose that

series It is well known that if the
series is not absolutely convergent,
then by rearranging the terms of the
series, we can make it converge to an
arbitrarily chosen real number
During the talk we will look at the
question of rearrangement of series
from a different angle Suppose that a
permutation of positive integers is
given. We can ask then, for example
is there an infinite series with sum 0
such that using the given permuta
tion to rearrange its terms we get a
series convergent to 1? A result

tions of this type has been recently
proved by C. St J A Nash-Williams

Women's Soccer attempts to rebound

by Kevin Romano
Contributing writer

ter eluding charging goalie Beth
O'Boyle.
Again the Lady Bullets
came back. Freshman midfielder
Jill Piekarski finalized a furious
flury in front of the Haverford goal
when she scored with around 34
minutes to go. The score tied the
game at 2-2.

The Lady Bullets women's
soccer team lost 3-2 to Centeniel
Conference challenger Haverford
College on Saturday, October
18th, at home. The loss was
Gettysburg's second in a row fol
lowing a 12 game winning streak.
With leading scorer Amy
Brewster sidelined with leg inju
ries and senior playmaker Paula
Connard playing on a sore
achillies tendon the Bullets came
out flat and fell behind 1 -0 at half
time. Less than a minute into the
second half Bullet sophomore
Lauren Morrell scored her first
collegiate goal and energized the
Lady Bullets. But the momentum
turned Haverford's way once
again with 38 minutes to play
when a Fords' attacker got behind
the Bullets' defense and scored af-

Thetie
and the
game were
lost a few
minutes later
when Haverford scored on a
cross from
the left side
of the box.
The 3-2 loss

was the Bul
lets' first against a conference foe.
Gettysburg outshot the Fords 18
5 on Saturday but were unable to
capitalize on their efforts.
Over the College's reading

days long weekend the Lady Bul
lets lost 1-0 to Carnegie-Mellon
University in Pittsburgh. Playing
on astroturf for the first time this
season the Bullets dominated the
game but were unable to find the
back of the net.
Assistant Coach Jamie

Wilhite said the
game came down to
a difference in
styles. "They
played long ball,
that's not us. We
played to their
level." The Bullets
dropped to 12-3
with the losses but
are ranked fifteenth
nationally in Divi
sion III. Said

Wilhite of the losses, "We like to
play a very disciplined and struc
tured system. But the last two
games we haven't."
On Saturday the Bullets will

try to end their slide when they
meet Notre Dame of Maryland at
12:30 at home. Then on Tuesday
Gettysburg takes on conference
co-leader Johns Hopkins on the
road in a game that figures to de
cide the conference champion
ship. "From here on out we're go
ing to have to take it one game at
a time," said Wilhite.
Other Notes: The girls soc
cer team was dissapointed Tues
day in their Centennial Confer
ence Championship at Johns
Hopkins. The Bullets lost 2-0, on
a the harsh artificial turf of the
Bluejays home field. The Bullet's
next game is against the College
of New Jersey. New Jersey's
women's soccer team is 50-1 in the
last four years. Pretty dominant.
They come into the game as the
number one team in the country,
but, you will never guess who their
last lost was to... Gettysburg.


Wrestlers begin with hopes of great season

Josh Eyler
Assistant Sports Editor
The air is begining to get
colder and colder. On a walk
through campus you can observe
many of the fall sports teams
winding-down as their last few
contests approach. Then, continue
your walk and travel down to
Bream-Wright-Hauser. You can't
help but notice that joining the vol
leyball team in the gymnasium are
the men's and women's basketball
teams. You sigh with content.
Winter sports are here.
The screaming crowds and
the rocking gyms will soon be

upon us. But as soon as you think
that, you realize that you are leav
ing something out. You walk up
the steps to the second floor of the
complex still wondering. You
walk right past it.
What, you might ask? What
am I walking by? Why the third
floor of Bream-Wright, of course.
I bet you didn't even know that
there was a third floor. It is not
very big, but on the third floor
there is a place where dreams are
realized, bones are broken, and
victories are won. You see, the
wrestling room is on the third
floor.

Very few people know what
goes on in that room and it is dif
ficult to explain as well. Suffice
to say that the wrestlers in that
room go through things that take
them to the thresholds of both their
minds and bodies.

The guys that go through
this share a unique bond of friend
ship. Day in and day out they
share the pain of injuries, the fa
tigue of constant conditioning, and
a third variable that is unique to
the sport. Food.
Many of the wrestlers sim
ply can't have food or much of it..
The diet of a wrestler who is los¬

ing weight is such that he is al
ways hungry and thirsty before
practice even starts. Many have
to lose approximately 10 pounds
per week of matches.
It is not a pleasant feeling
by any stretch of the imagination.
However, the feeling of stepping
on the mat during a match and
winning, whether by a point or a

pin, makes up for all of the other
aspects of the sport.
This year the Bullet wres
tling team has to adjust to a new
coach. Over the summer, Dave
Wilson, the coach of the program
for the last eight years, took a job
opportunity in Connecticut.
The new coach for the team
is Troy Dell, an alumnus from

1995. The captains of the team
have remained the same as last
year: Jake Dell, Chris Clifford,
and Brad McCutcheon. Their first
match is November 8 at home and
they would enjoy the support of
all the fans as they go for the Cen
tennial Conference Champion
ship.

Brewster making strong comeback for women's soccer squad

by Scott Grabus
Contributing Writer / B.A.S.S
member B.A.S.S. Profile
Name: Amy Brewster
Age: 20
Hometown: Trumbull, CT
Sport: Women's Soccer
Major: Psychology
Year of Graduation: 1999
Hobbies/Interests: Any
athletic activity
Our women's soccer team is
currently 13-3 and most likely on
its way to the post-season with just
a few more wins. Many players
contributed to the Lady Bullets'

success, but one player who stands
out is junior forward, Amy
Brewster. Due to her determina
tion, Amy has made an unlikely
comeback to the women's soccer
team. Brewster, who started as a
freshman, was a key scorer for the
Bullets with 8 goals. Unfortu
nately, she went down at mid-sea
son with an injury. While on a
breakaway to score yet another
goal, Amy was slide-tackled from
behind, and tore tendons in her
ankle. Not only did she miss the
rest her freshman season, but due
to surgery and rehabilitation she
missed her entire sophomore sea
son.

"It was really tough not
playing," says Amy talking about
the sport she's been playing since
first grade. This extended
offseason taught her to take ad
vantage of the time she has left to
play soccer.
The injury has also served
to be a great motivator for her.
Brewster already has 11 goals for
the team this year. She hopes to
be a key component in leading the
Lady Bullets on to the playoffs.
It has been a great year for
the women's soccer team and Amy
says, "It's great to be back again."
Good luck to Amy and the rest of
the Lady Bullets soccer team.

Amy Brewster has returned to the lineup to be a strong player
for the Riillfitft



Bullets slap Mules silly with offensive barrage

The dominating running of Paul Smith and Matt Helwig punished Muhlenberg for 44 points

By Peter Huminski
Staff Writer It was a record setting after
noon Saturday in Musselman Sta
dium when the Gettysburg Bullets
bowled over the Muhlenberg
Mules 44-32.
In front of a Homecoming
crowd of 1,384, sophomore run
ning back Paul Smith exploded for
a Centennial Conference record of
373 all-purpose yards. Smith also
tied a school record of five touch
downs in a single game.
After three slow weeks of
fensively, the Bullets (3-4, 2-3 in
Centenial Conference) came back
to life, gaining 547 total yards.
"Our kids played hard against a
team that we think is a good well
coached hustling football team,"
said Bullets coach Barry Streeter.
"I was excited about the way we
ran the ball, but I think our pass
ing game kept them off-balance."

Going into the game, the
Bullets offensive line had been a
little banged up. With junior
tackle Pete Scaffidi sidelined with
an injury, Bullets relied on fresh
man Jack Starkey to fill the gap
and protect quarterback Dennis
Flaherty's blind side.
The rest of the offensive line
remained intact however with se
nior Kurt Ritter anchoring the cen
ter position, senior Bryan Willard,
and junior Justin Orgorek at the
guards, and sophomore Bill
Beining at the other tackle spot.
This five-some played an excellent

game and opened up the game of
fensively for the Bullets.
The offensive line allowed
the Bullets to rush for 391 yards
on 46 carries. Smith rushed for
220 yards on 15 carries, while
backfield mate Matt Helwig
rushed for 134 yards on 15 car
ries. Smith had touchdown runs
of 2, 7, 52, and 80 yards.
"The offensive line had
holes that you could drive a truck
through," said Smith. "It was
beautiful. I made the cuts I'm told
to make, and anticipated the
blocks that were supposed to be
there and I was gone."
The Bullets passing game
was also revitalized against the
Mules. Flaherty used a solid mix
of poise, confidence, and a strong
arm to pick apart the Mules sec
ondary. Flaherty completed 8 of
11 passes for 156 yards and one
touchdown. The touchdown came
on an 87 yard pass to Jeff Closz
on the Bullets first drive of the
game. Flaherty also added a 1
yard touchdown run.
"He's (Flaherty) young.
He's just learning stuff, but I
thought he did a nice job today
(Saturday)," said Streeter. "He put
the ball where it belonged and
made some good calls at the line
of scrimmage, and ran the option
pretty well."
Closz finished the game
with three catches for 123 yards
including the touchdown. John
Capaldi also had three catches for
26 yards. Capaldi's catches came

on several key third down situa
tions that kept Bullet drives alive.
The Bullets bend but never
break defense also had several big
plays. After Wayne Rumsey's
opening kickoff sailed into the end
zone the Mules inarched 75 yards
down the field to the Bullet 5-yard
line. This was as far as the Bul
lets' defense would allow them.
On third and one
Muhlenberg's Mike Martino was
met by nose tackle Greg Gudis for
no gain. On fourth down and one
Martino was met by defensive
tackle John Meier for another no
gain. This defensive stand gave
the Bullets the ball.
The Bullets then marched
95 yards in two minutes to score
on Flaherty's 87 yard pass to
Closz. This staked the Bullets to
a 7-0 lead. The Bullets led 19-6
at halftime.
In the second half the Bul
lets used several big plays offen
sively and defensively to hold of
the Mules and earn the victory.
The Bullets largest lead was 25-6.
The Mules came back and cut the
Bullet lead to 38-33, before Smith
took the kickoff 82 yards and
scored his fifth touchdown of the
game to put the game away for
good. The Mules had a some fight
left in them after Smith's touch
down. Trailing 45-33 Muhlenberg
quarterback George Fosdick drove
the Mules to the Gettysburg 27
yard line. With 2:15 left in the
game Fosdick threw a pass toward

Paul Smtih rumbles for a few of his 220 yards against
Muhlenberg

his favorite receiver Chuck Draper
at the four yard line. Safety Kevin
Gurski saw this and stepped in
front of the pass and intercepted
it to preserve the win.
Despite giving up over 500
yards of offense to the Mules the
Bullet defense had several big
plays to help key in the victory.
"I am happy we won," said
Smith. "We were in a real slump
and needed to get this win. It is
very emotional. Everyobdy talked
at the team meeting and said that

Needed: News Writ
ers and Copy Editors
Call the 'Burgian
x6449

we had to get our heads in the
game. This is the most emotion
we've played with and it shows.
Everybody fought down to the
very last minute and we came out
with the win."
"We have to keep improv
ing in every phase of the game,"
said Streeter. The Bullets will
have their chance for improvement
Saturday when they travel to
Lebanon Valley to take on the
Dutchmen.

The Ultimate Netminder

by Chesha Miller
Staff Writer Beth O'Boyle is all about
athletics. Since she started play
ing soccer at the age five, nothing
has been more important to the
Gettysburg senior. O'Boyle, who
plays both soccer and basketball
for Gettysburg, has always found
that her best friends come from
playing sports. "I really enjoy
competing," Beth explained. "It is
my own natural high. I have such
a passion for both games."
O'Boyle describes herself
as a soccer and basketball major.

"I work by the books for athlet
ics," she commented, "I compare
everything in my life to athletics."
Beth's extreme dedication
to athletics made a severly broken
leg before her freshman year es
pecially discouraging. But
O'Boyle fought back, and four
years later she is the sole goalie
and starting point guard for Get
tysburg women's soccer and bas
ketball teams, respectively.
O'Boyle, who is fondly known as
OB, played soccer with the boys'
teams from the time she was five
until the eighth grade.

She did the same with bas
ketball, which she started playing
in the third grade. "I liked play
ing with the boys better," Beth ex
plained, "it was more competitive
and more fun."
Beth has continued to play
in a competitive, fun atmosphere
all her life. In high school, she
played for both the soccer and bas
ketball teams at the Academy of
the Holy Cross in Maryland.
At Gettysburg, O'Boyle has
had to overcome a lot, especially
with her broken leg freshman year,
yet she has worked her way to a
starter, as well as team captain and
star, of both of her teams. In soc
cer, Beth has always been the
goalie. "Basketball players usu
ally become soccer goalies, be
cause they have good hands," re
marked O'Boyle. This always
pleased her as it meant the pros¬

pect of a lot less running than if
she were playing the field.
As a sophomore, O'Boyle
was given a unique opportunity to
start as goalie when the senior
starter was injured. It gave Beth
the ability to gain back the confi
dence which had been broken with
her leg and to show Gettysburg
soccer coach Todd Wawrousek her
talent. "O.B. (as she has been nick¬

named by her
friends) played
exceptionally well
the last few games
of her sophomore
year, which really
helped her coming
in as the only goal

keeper her junior
year," commented
Coach Wawrousek.
After her

junior year, know
ing that she was
again going to be
the sole goal
keeper, Beth
worked extra hard
in the offseason to
return this August
in tip-top shape.
She enlisted
the help of a per
sonal fitness
trainer and also
gained many help
ful hints from
Gettysburg's new
goal keeper coach
Jaime Wilhite.
"The goal
keeper coach has
enhanced OB's

In her two sports Beth O'Boyle is either taking shots or
stopping them.

performance by developing and
fine tuning her technique," Coach
Wawrousek explained, "as a result
she is playing with a different ap
proach style."
This new style has had quite
a positive effect on O'Boyle's
playing as she has had eight shut
outs thus far this season. The
school record, which Beth is rap
idly approaching, is 8.5 games.
O'Boyle has also had a great num-

Whether she is shooting the ball into the net in basketball, or keeping the ball out of the net
in soccer, Beth O'Boyle always knows what to do with ball.

ber of "amazing" saves this sea
son. Coach Wawrousek said, "OB
is one of the best goal keepers in
the region, she is not flashy, but
efficient."
The success of the women's
soccer team this season rests
heavily on the talent of the team
as whole and is further enhanced
by Beth's prowess as a goal
keeper. "My teammates are the
reason we are doing so well [this

year], she comments, "we have
great unity both on and off the
field." Beth is hoping that the soc
cer team will sweep the last of
their season games and qualify for
the NCAA tournament. As soon
as the soccer season comes to a
close, Beth will trade in her cleats
for sneakers, and make the jump
from soccer to basketball.
"The hardest thing is to go

player," he says.
In addition to being captain
of both of her teams, Beth is also
a STAR (Students Teaching Ath
letes Responsibly) of both teams.
In fact, she is the president of
Gettysburg's STAR council. "I am
really proud of STARS," said
O'Boyle, "I think it is the one
thing that gets all the athletes in
volved together and I think that is
really important."

straight from soccer to basketball,"
Beth commented. "I have to ad
just from diving on the grass to
running up and down the court."
The change is most challenging on
Beth's body, but she makes the
adjustment well.
Beth, who is a point guard,
as well as the captain of the bas
ketball team, is looking forward
to the winter season. "I'd really
like to make it back to the confer
ence playoffs and
make a run for the
championship,"
s she explained.
_f Gettysburg
* * " women's basket
t ball coach Mike
„ _Jj Kirkpatrick is
« t . ? counting on Beth
i.j_%_l. ' , .._~. to be one of the

team leaders this
upcoming season.
"I am hoping
Beth will keep ev
eryone focused
with her laid back
approach to
people," com
mented Coach
Kirkpatrick.
Beth's approach to
basketball and her
understanding of
the sport intensifies
her athletic ability,
according to Coach
Kirkpatrick.
"Beth under
stands the big pic¬

ture and competes
to the best of her
ability, which
makes her an
above average

Beth is also a member of the
Alpha Delta Pi sorority and has
written various pieces for both the
Spectrum and The Gettysburgian.
Beth is a psychology major with
a double minor in history and edu
cation.
She is hoping one day to
coach either on the collegiate or
high school level. There is also a
chance that as she has one year of
eligibility left, due to her injury
freshman year, she may return to
Gettysburg in the fall to play soc¬

cer. "I hope she takes advantage
of her last year of eligibility," said
Coach Wawrousek, "it would be
great to have her back with the
team another year."
According to both of her
coaches, as well as her teammates,
Beth has a great ability to read
people. She can anticipate con
flict and is always willing to help
resolve it. This is not surprising
considering her family back
ground.
O'Boyle is the youngest of

eight children and has, therefore,
had to work at getting along in
large groups all her life. "I love
having a big family," she said.
"Family dinners are the best; they
are usually pretty funny."
Beth greatly admires her
parents for what they have done
for her and her seven siblings.
Beth's parents have always sup
ported her athletic career and even
convinced her to go to Gettysburg
because of its close proximity to
home—that way they would be
able to easily attend many of
Beth's soccer and basketball

games.
Not surprisingly, for Beth,
everything comes down to athlet
ics. When asked which sport is her
favorite, Beth replied with a
chuckle, "Soccer during soccer
season, and basketball during bas
ketball season." That defines
O'Boyle pretty well. She is some
one who puts her heart one hun
dred and ten percent into anything
that she does, especially when it
comes to athletic competitions.

Men's Soccer driving toward the
post-season

By Rob Kraft
Staff Writer On October 29, at 2:30, the
Gettysburg men's soccer team
traveled to Western Maryland to
take on the Green Terror on a beau
tiful, cool sunny day. That was
about all that was nice for the
Western Maryland squad as the
Bullets destroyed the Green Ter
ror 6-0.
Coach Wright said, "I am
very proud of the squad, the men
have played with great determina
tion, and it has showed." The Get
tysburg men are now 12-3-1 for
their overall record and 5-0-1 in the
conference. They are presently
ranked third in the region and

twentieth in the nation. If the Bul
lets play with the same tempo they
have in the past three games they
have a shot at the national play
offs. The first half of play started
with the Bullets jumping out to a
1-0 lead. The goal was scored by
Chris Pryor, who now has scored
5 goals in the last three games.
The great play of Jon Katerba
again was demonstrated as he
blocked four shots alone in the first
half. The play of both Jim Green
and Matt Kelly on defense helped
the Bullets leave the Green Terror
in utter frustration.
The second half of play was
the bread and butter for Gettysburg
as they recorded 5 goals to jump

out to a 6-0 lead that the Green
Terror would never contest. Those
goals were scored by Oliver King,
Chris Pryor, Andrew Addonizio,
Brian Hill, and Josh Rubinich. The
Bullets offense again recorded an
other impressive shot out as they
have outscored their opponents 13
0 in the last three games.
The Bullets next game is on
Saturday November 1, at 1:00 at
home against F&M. Let us all go
to the game and give the Bullets
support.
Other Notes: The Bullets
played Swathmore on October 25
at home and defeated them 3-0.
They also played Catholic in
Washington D.C. on October 23,
and won impressively, 4-0.

College consoles after crisis

by Henry Fawell
Staff Writer In the hours following the shock
ing death of 19 year-old student Casey
Dunn, Gettysburg College was quick to
reach out and support those members
of the student body, faculty and admin
istration most afflicted by the sudden
tragedy. Despite the overwhelming
sense of confusion and disbelief which
set in late Saturday night, several offices
in the administration immediately of
fered a helping hand to both friends and
peers in need of comfort and solace.
Saturday night, after the death was
confirmed by the Borough Police, the
residents of Corner Cottage, where

Dunn resided, were informed of the
incident which occurred at approxi
mately 9:30 p.m. Immediately follow
ing the announcement, Pastor Joseph
Donnella and Assistant Chaplain Bill
Gohl opened Christ Chapel on a
twenty-four hour basis for those in
need. All members of the faculty were
immediately contacted, as well.
On Sunday morning the Chapel
held a memorial service attended by
many friends and peers, including mem
bers of Alpha Xi Delta sorority and Al
pha Phi Omega fraternity, both of which
Dunn was a member. Faculty members
and administrators were also in atten
dance. Members of the Counseling Ser
vice and Residence Life joined Donnella
and Gohl by offering their assistance in

the chapel throughout the day and
evening.
In order to quell any uncertainty
filtering through the campus on Sun
day, Dean Julie Ramsey issued a for
mal, campus-wide statement via email
defining the situation. Ramsey ex
plained the incident, including the facts
uncovered at the time and what sup
port services were to be offered to those
who were in need of guidance.
Dr. Bill Jones of the Counseling
Services stated that his office, "received
as many calls [Sunday and Monday] as
was expected during a time of crisis."
Counseling was available to all groups
in need, particularly Alpha Xi Delta and
Alpha Phi Omega, and will continue to
be so as long as it is needed.

Monday saw several classes can
celed, evidence that faculty were well
aware of the impact Saturday night's
events had on the students. In fact, a
number of professors canceled classes
because of their own personal ties to
Dunn. Of the classes that did continue,
however, several absences were evident.
Yet, many professors took the time to
speak with students about Dunn and
how to cope with such shocking news.
Marcie DePalma, President of Al
pha Xi Delta, said, "Every one was re
ally great, It was really shocking the way
people were helping out. People we
didn't even know were offering us their
support. There was just a whole lot of
love."

Student commits suicide

by Sara Sprenkle
Managing Editor
On Saturday, November 4,
sophomore Casey I. Dunn hanged
herself in her dormitory room in
Corner Cottage.
At 9:20 that evening, Gettys
burg Police were called to Corner
Cottage for an apparent suicide.
Dunn was taken to Gettysburg
Hospital where she was pronounced
dead at 9:55 p.m.
Police treated the death as a
suicide and had no reason to suspect
that foul play was involved, Gettys
burg Police Chief Fred Gantz told
the Hanover Evening Sun.
Drugs and alcohol did not play
a significant, if any, role in Dunn's
suicide.
Dunn's approximate time of
death was between 8:30 to 9:10 pm,
said Adams County Coroner Pat
Leinbach.

After Dunn s identity was con
firmed, Chaplain Joseph Donnella

called her parents.
As soon as all information
was verified, Dean Julie Ramsey
sent out a campus-wide e-mail at
12:30 am to quash any rumors
and direct students on how to get
help if counseling was needed.
About 150 people attended
a 2 am prayer service Sunday, just
four hours after Dunn was de
clared dead.
Two viewings were held at
2-4 pm and at 7-9 pm. Dunn's
sisters in Alpha Xi Delta and
brothers in Alpha Phi Omega
placed her pins on her for burial.
Dunn's funeral was held
Tuesday, November 4 at 10 am
in St. Anthony's of Padua Church
in Baltimore. Gettysburg College

was well-represented as fifty stu
dents, several faculty, Ramsey,
and Assistant Chaplain Bill Gohl
attended, while Donnella and
Father Brian Conrad participated
in the mass.
Led by Donnella, Gohl, and

see Student death
page 4

Conrad, a memorial service for
the campus community was held
at 5 pm later that evening. The
information of the service was not
released publicly since the service
was intended for the campus com
munity. About 750 students, fac
ulty, staff, and administrators at
tended the service.
Dunn's roommate, along
with Aynsley Hamel, and several
members of Alpha Phi Omega,
who volunteered to take tickets at
the Fiona Apple concert Saturday
night, left Corner Cottage around
7:20 pm before Dunn's 8:30 ar
rival from shopping at Cranberry
Mall wiht two 1997 graduates
from Gettysburg College.

Casey Irene Dunn 1978-1997



Casey Dunn remembered

by Chesha Miller
Staff Writer Casey Dunn had a huge
heart. She reached out to many
different people on campus and
significantly changed their lives.
A huge force in whatever activ
ity she undertook, she shared her
love and enthusiasm in the class
room, with her Alpha Xi Delta
sisters, Alpha Phi Omega broth
ers, fellow tour guides, choir
members, and Gettysburgian
staffer members.
No matter what that
Casey did, her infectious smile
and laughter brought joy to all
who had the pleasure of know
ing her.
If one thing is certain, it is
that Casey loved to help people.
She was always concerned with
taking care of everyone else. At
any time of the night Casey's
friends could count on her to be
there for them and to be willing
to give advice and help solve
their problems.

Through her weekly
"Dear Casey" column in The
Gettysburgian the entire campus
community benefitted from her
advice.
"Casey was always cheer
ing everyone up," said her soror
ity sister, Emily Leone, "she
made us laugh no matter what."
This sentiment was ech
oed by all of Casey's friends.
"She always listened to others'
problems and helped them in
any way she could. She was a
very kind and giving person,"
commented another of Casey's
sisters, Shelby Hockenberry.
Alec Beekmans, Casey's
Alpha Phi Omega brother, said
"She is one of several people I
know who majored in finding
out about other people. She did
a whole lot to make sure that

people felt special. I believe that
she is still very interested in our
lives- she is just now watching
them from a different vantage
point."
A deep desire to make sure
her friends were doing well was
present in all of Casey's actions.
If her friends were struggling,
Casey was always on hand to
share a cup of tea or a conversa¬

tion over a long walk.
If she felt she couldn't per
sonally provide comfort she
knew she could always count on
Assistant Chaplain Bill Gobi's
help. "Casey would come into
my office seven days a week and
tell me who needed help, who I
should see, and who I should
send others to see," Bill Gohl
explained. That was who Casey
was, the person who always went
the extra mile for anyone who
might need her assistance.
Casey cheered her friends
up in a great variety of ways.
"She loved to embroider," ex
plained Julie Wilmer, "she made
many of us some very special
things." For Julie (who admit
ted that she often spills things on
her self) Casey made a bib with
the words "for when you spill"
embroidered on it. This semes
ter as Julie is not on campus,
Casey felt it was her job to help
keep Julie in the loop. She wrote
Julie the "Chronicles of Life in a

Coconut" regularly, which was
her own little newspaper describ
ing the news, sports and happen
ings at Gettysburg.
Casey loved to share her
self through her writing. She was
a true writer at heart, writing not
only for The Gettysburgian, but
also for herself. "Casey sent me
a few poems which she wrote
she was so eloquent," Julie com
mented.
Casey also made up her
own silly songs which she sang
and played along to with her
guitar. Open-mic night at the
coffee house was a favorite of
Casey's. She often got up with
her guitar and good friend,
Rebecca Babbitt, to sing her
spoofs, even though many times
these songs were sung off key.
In addition to being a con
stant support to her friends,
Casey was herself a true indi
vidual. She demonstrated her
individualism in everything she
did from what she ate, to how
she dressed and acted.

Even her speech was
unique. Casey's favorite word
was "Dude!" She used it inces
santly and something would
have seemed amiss had Casey
not begun a sentence with an
emphatic "Dude!"

Casey was an individual
on a campus that reeks of con
formity," commented Alec
Beekmans, "Casey was never
afraid to be herself and I greatly
admired her for this."
Beekmans also had the
pleasure of being Casey's first
director in one of her lunch time
one-act plays. "I was fortunate
enough to know Casey as an ac
tress, an APO pledge and
brother, a writer, a tour guide, a
supporter and a confidante,"
Alec explained.
Casey's individuality
shone bright in many aspects of
her life.. Sometimes quite liter
ally as in her neon green shirt and
silver pants, an outfit she pur
chased with her friends on a
Gettysburgian trip to New York
City. They promised her she
would never wear it, but Casey
proved them wrong, as was typi
cal of her nature. She sported
her shocking attire, if even only
to prove her friends wrong.

Casey was always doing
silly things to prove her points
and make people laugh," noted
her friend Kate Naughton.
"She was a unique indi
vidual with a very independent
sense about her- she was one of
a kind," commented Ellen
Livingston, overseer of tours for
the Admissions Office.
"She's one of the most
unique, unforgettable people
that I've ever met," said Alpha
Phi Omega brother, Barb
Dickson, "Life without her will
never be the same."
Casey even brought her
own individuality into the food
she choose to eat. Her meals at
Servo always included some
"random, weird" concoction,
like frozen yogurt on top of corn
bread. She loved to take a walk
up to the Lincoln Diner for hot
fudge brownies with Barb
Dickson.

Casey's enjoyment of all
different types of food earned
her the fond nickname, "Pan
cake". She was given this spe
cial nickname after last spring's
Alpha Xi Delta annual pancake
supper at which Casey was a
"pancake making fool." She
cranked out many, many pan¬

cakes, but they were unlike any
pancakes her sisters had ever
seen before.
Casey managed to create
pancakes of every shape, size,
and color and even managed to
decorate the Chapel kitchen with
pancake batter. "Casey was the
only underclassman allowed to
cook [pancakes] and she loved
it. She even made up a funny
pancake song," explained Emily
Leone.
The sisterhood of Alpha Xi
Delta felt very blessed to have
Casey as their only formal rush
pledge last spring. "Casey was
so excited to wear her letters,"
explained close friend and Alpha
Xi big sister Aynsley Hamel, "she
ran up down the halls of Hanson
basement trying to convince ev
eryone to join."

Casey succeeded in that by
bringing 4 pledges to Alpha Xi
the very week after she became
a pledge. "It never got Casey
down that she was the only sis
ter that went through formal
rush last year," commented
Miranda Fegley, one of Casey's
fellow Alpha Xi pledges last
spring. "Casey always pulled Al
pha Xi together-she really
wanted us to bond as a sister
hood," Miranda said, "she ex
emplified what we stand for."
A bright light shinning in
her classrooms and in her jobs,
Casey was an exuberant person.
"[She] in several ways was an
ideal college student," com
mented English professor Chris
Fee. "She had enthusiasm and
desired to grow emotionally,
spiritually and academically."

This semester Casey was
taking a Medieval Renaissance
literature class with Professor Fee
and Women's History with Pro
fessor Cynthia Cupples of the
history department. "Casey kept
working back and forth between
the two," explained Professor
Cupples. "She made constant
connections and challenged
people to stop and think. Casey
was a vibrant presence inside the
classroom and out."
Casey was a definite force
in all of her classes. She could
be counted on to share her in
sight on any topic.

Casey was a special part of
English chairperson Dr. Eliza
beth Lambert's first year semi
nar last fall. "The whole class
was so special," commented Dr.
Lambert, "I will never forget that
class." Casey wrote a paper for
Dr. Lambert explaining her first
driving experience with her fa
ther. " It was wild. I think it
was not just a lesson, but a dec
laration of independence. She
was effervescent and possessed
a wonderful sparkle. I felt as
though she could handle any
thing," Dr. Lambert remarked.
Casey was a very hard
working, dedicated person. This
summer she remained on cam
pus and worked three jobs. On
campus she worked for Finance
and Administration. She was

also a tour guide for the admis
sions office. Ellen Livingston
who was pleased to have Casey
as an employee said, "she repre
sented our office and Gettysburg
College in a professional and
personable manner, and she re
ceived many positive accolades
to that effect from prospective
students and their families who
she toured."
In addition to her campus
employment, Casey worked for
the Gettysburg Times; a job she
was proud to have. Casey
worked for the Times as a pho
tographer and a journalist on the
occasions when her writing ex
pertise was needed.
An expert not only in writ
ing, but in making friends, Casey
left lasting impressions.

The first time Aynsley
Hamel met Casey was last fall at
Sigma Nu. The pair talked for a
while and eventually the discus
sion led to Casey's playing the
guitar. "I said that I'd always
wanted to learn how to play the
guitar," Aynsley explained, "and
she said, '—dude, come over, I'll
teach you.' I never got my gui
tar lessons, but I did get a best
friend. Casey was my little sis
ter in Alpha Xi and my big
brother in APO, but above all
that she was a friend of mine."

Suicide: know the warning signs

by Laura Root
Contributing Writer
Suicide is a leading cause
of death among young people.
In a 1991 survey of U.S. teens
by the Centers for Disease Con
trol, more than 27 percent ad
mitted that they had seriously
contemplated suicide in the
previous year. Eight percent
said that they had actually tried
to kill themselves during that
same period.
Today an estimated
276,000 people under the age

of 20 attempt suicide each year.
More than 5,000 of them suc
c e e d .
Young people who try to
kill themselves usually fall into
three groups. The first of these
groups include those who ap
pear to be well-adjusted, but
are living in stressful situations.
A person in the second
group is usually depressed and
/ or anxious. They could be
emotionally stressed by dealing
with substance abuse, problems
in school, or interpersonal loss.
The third group consists

of those who are impulsive,
aggressive, or self-destructive.
Impulsive acts are often linked
to suicide.
Drug and alcohol abuse
plays an especially large role in
the suicide of young people.
Recent studies have shown that
rates for suicide and attempted
suicide are five to twenty per
cent higher among substance
abusers than the general popu
lation. Many people who are
chemically-dependent do not
realize that their depression is
drug-related. They often think

that their feelings are just a re
flection of the way that things
really are.
Stress is another common
cause of suicide, especially in
the case of college students.
People with a lot of stress in
their lives may feel like there is
no escape from the pressure in
their life except for death.
Learning ways to cope with
stress can help remedy this
problem. Those dealing with
a lot of stress should seek pro
fessional help, talk about their
problem with others, take

breaks from working, learn to
relax, exercise regularly, plan
ahead, and be realistic in their
expectations of themselves.
The most important thing
to remember about suicide is
that it can be prevented. Most
people who are contemplating
suicide give off warning sings.
They may experience behav
ioral changes, including
changes in eating or sleeping
patterns, withdrawal from
friends and family, substance
abuse, loss of interest in favor
ite activities, or the giving away

of valued possessions.
Personality changes can
include anger, anxiety, depres
sion, aggressiveness, hopeless
ness, hypersensitivity, frequent
boredom_.problems concentrat
ing, or an unexplained decline
in school performance. Health
problems can also hint to sui
cide. Complaints to frequent
headaches, weight loss or gain,
nausea, or fatigue could involve
any serious illness that some
one might want to escape from.
People considering sui
cide want to end their pain, not

necessarily their lives. How
ever, they have given up hope
that anyone can help them. To
help someone who is consider
ing suicide, it is important to
talk openly with them. Asking
the person question can help
determine how serious he or
she is about wanting to end his
or her own life.
It is imperative to be a
good listener and look for non
verbal clues that might show
how a person is feeling. Be sure
to show the person that they
are loved and that someone will
always be there to listen to horn
or her.

Memories of a friend

Julie Wilmer, who was
Aynsley's roommate last year,
stayed up late talking with Casey
while drinking tea the first time
they met.
Anne Marie Moore, a fel
low tour guide of Casey's also
has a unique story about the first
time she met Casey. Anne Marie
as a veteran guide was to be
Casey's "buddy" and give her
her first practice tour.
Remembering Casey's first
practice tour, Anne Marie said,
"We were walking past the
chapel, and she turned to me and
said, '-Do you smoke?' I said,'—
yeah, would you like to bum
one?' I remember she said some
response with "dude" in it as she
pulled out her pack of menthols.
And, from there, we continued
Casey's first tour of the summer
She was a dear friend, and her
loss will be felt very deeply."

For Barb Dickson, who
lived next door to Casey last
year, their friendship was quite
accidental. "One day I was walk
ing to my room and walked
through her open door by mis
take. I was going to leave im
mediately, but she made me stay
and talk to her. That's really how
Casey was. She decided that she
wanted to make a friend, and she
did." Casey was a source of hap
piness on her first-year floor.
Resident Assistant Kate
Costellatalked about how Casey
was always thinking of other
people. "She used to make ban
ners for people on our floor
when their birthdays came
around. She was a constant pres
ence for me on the floor, always
stopping by to talk, and sharing
her thoughts openly with me.
We helped each other so much

continued from page 2
last year, and I will miss her."
Nat Gordon who also
lived on Casey's floor last year
was a member of Casey's Alpha
Xi pledge class. It was Casey
who, because of her great enthu
siasm, convinced Nat to join Al
pha Xi. "Casey was a special
person who was always there for
everyone else. She loved to talk
to and meet people, we could
never get her to shut up," Nat
said fondly. "The thing that
amazed me most about Casey
was that she never held any
grudges against anyone. She was
friends with everybody," Nat
continued.
This fall Casey decided to
take on yet another activity and
join Chapel Choir. Choir direc
tor Dr. Sharon Gratto com
mented on her first meeting with
Casey. "She was enthusiastic to

audition for me and to be a part
of the group," said Dr. Gratto,
"I distinctly remember her per
sonal introduction, like me and
a couple of other choir members,
she was from Baltimore, a city
that is a source of a rather amus
ing accent."
Excited to get involved
with the events of the Chapel
and to meet Gettysburg's new
chaplain, Pastor Joseph
Donnella, Casey was the first stu
dent on campus to introduce
herself to him. Commenting
"she was an introspective soul
who was concerned with justice
and making sure that everyone
around her was being treated
well," Pastor Donnella had noth
ing but fond thoughts of Casey.
On October 10th, Casey
gave her own homily at Candle
Light Communion. "Casey had
a firm belief in who she thought

God was and she liked to share
it," said Assistant Chaplain Bill
Gohl, "that gives me real com
fort, because it shows that Casey
knew where she was going."
Full of light and vibrancy,
Casey was enthusiastic about
people and their lives. She was
a true individual whose presence
will be sorely missed on
Gettysburg's campus. A selfless
person, Casey would not want
anyone to sit around and grieve
for her loss.
In a recent letter to her
dear friend Julie Wilmer, Casey
closed with an important lesson
in life. "Smile, smile, smile, it
makes people wonder what you
have been doing," she said.
Now is the time to "smile,
smile, smile" for Casey, to en
sure her memory may live on in
our hearts.

SuperSKAIiiragilisticexpialidocious

-fellies-

by Scott Buhrman
Contributing Writer
I was trying to do some
homework, which turned into
another exercise of futility. I
usually wouldn't have cared,
but I was going to a Mighty
Mighty Bosstones concert that
evening and I knew I was go
ing to be tired when I got back.
Overcoming my struggle with
futility, I rallied to get ready for
the show. I got on my blue suit
and my black paratrooper
boots and went with a few
other people to the show.
The Bosstones had two
opening acts which were both
interesting in their own right,
but you could tell that the ma
jority of people there came to
see the Bosstones. Throughout
the first two bands, girls kept
coming up to me and asking me
if I was in the band and if could
sign their pieces of paper. I
wasn't really in a sporting
mood, so I quickly sent them
on their way.

It didn t take me long to
realize that the only reason that

these girls came up to me was
that I had a suit on. It doesn't
take a psych major to realize
that a lot of people are now
associating suits and popular
music with the Mighty Mighty
Bosstones. They feel that only
the band wears suits and can't
understand why an audience
member would do such a thing.
In seems that there is a
large portion of the listening
public that is not "in the know."
The truth of the matter is that
suits and ska music have gone
together ever since its origins
in the streets of Kingston. If
you look hard enough you
might even find a picture of
Bob Marley wearing a suit and
lacking his characteristic dread
locks. (Just a reminder, Bob
Marley and the Wailers were a
ska outfit that recorded such
tracks as "Simmer Down" and
"Put it On.," and this all hap
pened before he became the
internationally reggae singer
we know of today.)

This is the state of the
mainstream today. Now don't

get me wrong, I am not here to
knock on "trendies" (whatever
that means anyway)— I just
want to offer my opinion. Any
way, with bands like the Mighty
Mighty Bosstones being played
regularly on radio and MTV, it
seems that the ska genre is be
coming more popular as every
day goes by.
Even on campus, at
WZBT a new ska band named
Save Ferris (catchy name huh?)
and their cover of Dexy's Mid
night Riders song "Come on
Eileen" is enormously popular.
Some people don't even know
the song is a ska song, but they
play it nonetheless, perhaps
because of the nostalgia it gen
erates.
Regardless of the DJ's
musical knowledge, it is being
played, and yes, Rudy, it is a ska
song.

But these above men
tioned bands, as well as others
such as Reel Big Fish and Dance
Hall Crashers, are really just
the tip of the iceberg. All of
the bands named are ska-core/

ska-punk more or less. This
means that they incorporate
various elements of other mu
sic, such as guitar distortion,
frequent tempo changes, and a
differing drum pattern. It is a
bastardization of the
original ska music which came
out of Jamaica in the early six
ties, which doesn't make it in
ferior, but it does make it dif
ferent.
This growing trend of ig
norance concerning ska music
and its surrounding culture has
been a topic that has interested
me for quite some time. Am I
wrong to be angered when
people tell me that they listen
to "old-school" ska music and
have never heard of the
Skatatlites? Should I just ac
cept the fact that every genre
of music, once popularized, is
going to be somewhat lost in
the mass media? To be honest
I can't really answer these ques¬

tions. I would hypothesize that
the majority of people will stop
their ska adventures with what

is on the radio or MTV. This is
not surprising, for the major
ity of music listeners tend to
stay on the surface of music,
never looking for minor bands.
I remember that during the pre
lude to the Toasters concert last
fall, people were mad at the
concert committee calling the
band "mediocre." These people
associate record sales and video
play with talent, which is a big
mistake. The Bosstones and
Save Ferris are talented bands,
but there are a host of other
"minor" ska bands that have as
much talent, if not more, than
the popular ones.
So to sum up: ska popu
lar; people ignorant of ska his
tory and culture (but that's ok);
normal facet of pop culture;
don't think talent comes with
a price tag.

If you are actually inter
ested in some "minor" ska
bands, I'll give you a few
names. Check out the Toast
ers seventh release Don't Let
the Bastards Grind You Down
on Moonska records.

Bring a little Sunrise into your life

by Justin Etheredge
Staff Writer True romance is one of
life's most elusive, hypnotic
sensations. It's what love is
before it becomes love; often,
it never has the chance to be
come anything more. And only
rarely does a movie capture
romance so honestly, that it
makes you understand the real
magic behind the word.
Before Sunrise is a charm
ing story of romance as it, in
many cases, truly exists: un
planned, unintentional, and
totally irrational. Jesse (Ethan
Hawke) is an American on the
last day of his travels through
Europe.
On the train to Vienna to

catch his flight home, he meets
beautiful Celine (Julie Delpy),
a student at the Sorbonne on
her way back to Paris. They
talk, they laugh, and immedi
ately they discover a special
chemistry.
Jesse has no money for a
hotel, and his plan was to walk
around Vienna until his morn
ing flight. With his heart in his
hand, and a sense of sweet ur
gency, he convinces Celine to
join him. They grab their bags
and leave the train.
It's mid-afternoon when
they begin wandering. Most of
the movie is dialogue, discus
sions about love, dreams, child
hoods, family, and so on. They
trade secrets and desires, share

intimacies long before they
ever touch. And as they be
come closer as friends, they
cannot deny that there is some
thing more there.
The strength of the movie
comes in the sincerity of the
delivery. The conversations are
natural and engaging, never
trite or contrived.
In one amusingly awk
ward scene, Jesse and Celine
stand inside the listening booth
in a record store. The music
playing only echoes their un
spoken feelings for each other.
In any other movie, they would
look into each other's eyes,
kiss, go somewhere and have
sex, and we could assume that
they fell in love.

But alone in that booth,
reality kicks in, and things
aren't that simple. It's like re
membering the first time we
could have, and probably
should have, kissed the girl, but
didn't, either because we were
too nervous, or we weren't sure
she felt the same way, or what
ever. Heads turned, they wet
their lips in anticipation, but it
never happens. As one looks
over, the other looks away;
unbearably drawn out, the
moment is lost.
Written and directed by
Richard Linklater (Slacker,
Dazed and Confused), the
structure of the movie mirrors
the mentality of the lovers:
without direction, without des¬

tination, finding meaning along
the way. You have to wonder
if making a movie could actu
ally be so simple, and question
howsome movies like this
could fall so far short.
In the end, Jesse and
Celine know that their time
together was not love, but nei
ther was it just a one-night af
fair. Their romance existed
completely on its own terms,
in a circumstance that has hap
pened a million times before,
but may never happen to them
again. Being together was the
only thing in the world that
mattered to them, and that is
what made their night, and the
movie, so special.




A part of you has grown in me
Together for always and never apart
Maybe in distance, but never in heart

You are the one who makes each day fun
You are the one who gives me your kind love
You seem to be the perfect friend
So I know we'll be friends to the end
For no matter what, you're always there
And no matter what, you always care

These pages are given to the memory ot Casey, with
love from her sisters in Alpha Xi Delta








Down the tube

by Mark Berg
Contributing Writer
Some of the students in
the London Interdisciplinary
Program Abroad in England
had never been to Britain (or
even Europe) before, and their
image of London was formed
by reading novels such as
Charles Dickens_'s Pickwick
Papers.
Canterbury, population
34,500, which we visited later,
better fit their idea of an En
glish city. Bath is another good,
old-fashioned, English city.
In London, they were a)
pleasantly surprised at what
they found: a vibrant, exciting
city, and/or b) a little over
whelmed by the size and pace
of it all.

Okay, so London has
changed a bit in 100+ years.
First of all, it is big, bigger than
Gettysburg. Bigger than Adams
County, it has a population of
7 million. It takes a lot of sub
ways (the underground, or
tube), buses, and cars to move
these people around.
Most visitors to London
seem to prefer the tube. There
are 11 different lines which
cover (or, really, underlie) the
city, with many, many transfer
points.
The tube map is easy to
read (unless you're colorblind),
and you can almost always tell
where you are on the maps at
the entrances: there is a big
spot worn off where people put
their fingers to plan their jour
ney.

But there are problems
with the tube: it's hot in sum
mer and winter; it's almost al
ways crowded, even very late
at night; there are occasional
delays ("There is no service on
the Central Line west of St.
Paul's due to a person under a
train"); some dangers (an
nouncements to "Mind the
gap!" [between the car and the
platform]); but worst of all, you
can't see any of London. Your
impression of the city becomes
one of a group of disjointed
places; when you walk or ride
the bus, you get a feel for the
city as a whole.
The buses, on the other
hand, are like low-cost tour
buses, especially if you ride on

the top deck of a double-decker
bus. The front row of the top
deck is particularly exciting:
since you're at the very front
of the bus, even farther forward
than the driver, you often get
the feeling you're going o hit
the bus in front of you.
True, bus maps are not
easy to decipher, but how lost
can you get when you can al
ways get off and take the tube?
No matter what bus you take,
you're sure to see the architec
ture, the street life: the very
fabric of life in London. That
is, unless the bus gets stuck in
traffic, in which case you can
always get off and take the
tube. Which leads us to cars.
Traffic in London is horren
dous, and cars are a significant
danger for the unwary pedes
trian—actually, for any pedes
trian.

Of course you know that
they drive on the "wrong" side
of the road, so you really have
to think about which way to
look before crossing a street.
Fortunately, at most major in
tersections, "Look Right" or
"Look Left" is painted in large
letters on the street a foot or
so from the curb.
The real danger is not
actually the cars; it's the driv
ers. First of all, they drive very
(I think) fast for the city when
they're not stuck in traffic, even
though the speed limit is 30
mph. Worse yet, they seem to
hate pedestrians. You can al
most see the hate in their eyes
as they bear down upon you
whenever they think you have
encroached on their territory.
Maybe this is because they pay
$4.00 per gallon of petrol.

My suggestion is, either
take the bus (let the bus driver
scare the pedestrians), or,
whenever possible, walk from
place to place. Just be sure to
carry your London: A to Z map
book, because even the locals
don't know where even nearby
streets are.
Just be sure to watch out
for those cars.

Red Comer one to be avoided

by Jon Froehlich
Staff Writer "I know what I did and
did not do." - Jack Moore
It is difficult to pick out
and name the most disappoint
ing thing about Red Corner. It
wasn't the questionable acting,
or the fragmented storyline, or
the glaring ethnocentric
themes. No, it wasn't any of
these. The biggest letdown of
this latest movie from director
Jon Avnet (The Mighty Ducks,
Fried Green Tomatoes) was

that it could ve been so much
more if those who made this
movie had taken more time
to think it through and work
out the many kinks that make
it seem so minor league.
As corporate attor
ney Jack Moore, Richard
Gere (Internal Affairs, Pretty
Woman) delivers yet another
border-line performance play
ing the only type of role that
he seems even remotely capable
of: a high class, smooth talk
ing big-shot who always thinks
he's in control.

The plot of Red Cor
ner consists of a few discon
nected events that seem to
serve only the purpose of mak
ing China look bad. Moore,
in China to see to the closing
of a television deal, has a one
night stand with a fashion
model and wakes up the next
morning only to find her dead
and himself the main suspect.
As Moore is slapped
around and threatened with
execution, Red Corner, in the

tradition of movies like Mid
night Express, plays on our
fears of foreign, and what we
might consider barbaric, pun
ishment. While it has yet to be
seen if this movie will be criti
cized for the expressly negative
impression that it gives of
China as a nation, Red Corner
reeks of an ethnocentric atti
tude. Though one of minor char-

m umbles "™
something about how, if the
situations were reversed, the
United States wouldn't want
China muscling in, China's side
is left mostly untold.
Not only is Red Cor
ner socially questionable, but
the fact remains that it is sim
ply not a very good movie. It
lacks direction and focus and,
as a result, has many other ba
sic problems.
The language barrier, for
one, is a major problem with
this movie. Though undeniably
realistic, all the translations and
subtitles make Red Corner seem
fragmented and, as a result,
hard to follow. Even though
the language difference would
be one of the major problems

if one were actually in this situ
ation, it doesn't seem that hav
ing more people speaking flu
ent English would have dam
aged the already debatable in
tegrity of this movie.
With the situation as is,
the plot is hard to follow and
sometimes mentally draining to
comprehend - let alone enjoy.
Though there are somescenes
that are entertaining, these are,
as the expression goes, few and
far between.
We also get to see in
Red Corner the predictable
semi-romantic relationship
between male client and fe
male attorney. Yuelin, played
by Bai Ling (Nixon, The
Crow), comes in as Moore's
faithful lawyer. Though she
does a far superior acting job
than Gere, Ling's role is
equally unrealistic.

As Moore, though not a
criminal lawyer, attempts to
defend himself, Yuelin (for
some reason) forgoes all tradi
tional Chinese law and strikes
out of the well-trodden path to
find the truth. In this we see
the usual courtroom story
where a brilliant, young, attrac
tive lawyer picks apart a huge
conspiracy and triumphantly
saves the innocent defendant
from certain death.
Even taking into con
sideration the few decent scenes
and the delicate topic that this
movie contained, it is an un
avoidable conclusion that Red
Corner is a movie one can prob
ably miss without regret.

Students return to
preschool

From staff reports
Some Gettysburg College
students are going back to pre
school.
Each year the College's
psychology department sends
more than 100 students into the
local community to work in
nearly 10 different early child
hood programs. And while the
daycare centers, preschools, and
elementary schools provide the
college students with an oppor
tunity to study child develop
ment, the students also provide
the community with a valuable

.
Students are giving back to
the community through this pro
gram, according to Marcia
Brilhante, director and owner of
Child's Garden Child Care, a
center located on Mummasburg
Road, just outside of Gettysburg.
"The students help a lot more
than by just putting in time," she
said. "The children are exposed
to a variety of people and expe
riences, and that really makes a
difference in their behavior. And
the students lend a helping hand
that allows the staff to do other
things."

"Teachers tell us that the
students are quite helpful in their
classrooms, especially because
they can give the children move
individual attention than might
otherwise be possible," said
Kathy Cain, an associate profes
sor of psychology. "For our part,
we are very grateful to the teach
ers, parents, and children for giv
ing the students this wonderful
opportunity."
Psychology department
faculty members have required
students to volunteer in local
programs since 1990, according
to Martha Arterberry, associate
professor of psychology. While
they are in the classrooms, many
Gettysburg College students
merely observe the children.
More advanced students per
form "studies"—structured

games that require one-on-one
interaction with children and
allow the students to assess
things like the child's memory or
understanding of appearance
reality (the difference between
how something looks and what

it really is).
"Students learn about
children's abilities, and they
learn how to assess children as
a developmental psychologist
would," Arterberry said.
Arterberry has also ob
served that many students do
better in their college classes
after they've worked in the
community, because they can
relate textbook and lecture in
formation to their observa
tions. "It's one thing to read
about something in a book and
another to actually see it,"
Arterberry said.
There are a few "rules"
to the program, including par
ents permission for a child to
participate, according to Cain.
Research conducted by the col
lege students typically involves
asking general questions rather
than finding individual infor
mation they learn about a par
ticular child in their classroom

is strictly confidential. And the
child has the option of stopping
the session at any time if he or
she in uncomfortable.
Most children, however,
enjoy working with the college
students, Cain said. In fact,
they find questions asked dur
ing student research entertain
ing and fun. Gettysburg Col
lege students also seem to find
their work with young children
particularly rewarding, and
many go on to pursue careers
that involved working with
youngsters, according Cam and
Arterberry.
"Many of our students
are interested in careers with
children before taking these
classes, but more than a few of
the others have changed their
career plans after their day
care/preschool volunteer expe
rience in order to pursue jobs
that will enable them to work
with children," Cain said.

"This day-care center is
offering me a very fun and lov
ing experience," said Suzanna
Nam, a sophomore who is
working at Child's Garden. "I
hope that I can do something
associated with children after
graduation, even if it is just a
side job."

In Case You Missed It
Polanski scores in
Chinatown

by Glen Beck
Staff Writer

intense (would we expect any
thing less of Nicholson?).
Compelling in such movies as
The Shining and One Flew
Over the Cuckoo's Nest,
Nicholson doesn't let us down
here. Jack steals the scene even
when he doesn't say anything.
For example the scene between
Mulwray (an informant) and
Gittes, neither actor says a
word but the dramatic tension
can be cut by a knife (just like
Gitte's nose).
Dunaway, who has ap
peared in such classics as
Bonnie and Clyde, through her
presence and intensity, relays
the fragility and desperation of
her character in every scene.
She is a trooper and, from what
I can tell, a method actress.
The filmmaking overall is
suberb. The director knew
how to manipulate the camera
to make the shots heighten the
action and the tension. The

"Forget it, Jake. It's
Chinatown." Well, don't for
get—actually go rent it.
Chinatown, directed by Roman
Polanski is one of the classics
of the cinema; a must see. In
addition to the multi-Academy
Award Nominations (Best Ac
tor, Best Actress, Best Film, Best
Director) and the multi-Golden
Globe nominations including
two wins (one for Jack
Nicholson, one for Roman
Polanski), the film is one of the
best acted movies ever made.
The story follows Jack
Nicholson, as J.J. Gittes, a pri
vate eye who makes money off
husbands who suspect their
wife is cheating on them, and
vice versa.
He insists it's an honest
living and enjoys all the pub
licity he receives, until a
woman pretending to be the
wife of the head of the water
company uses him to frame the
poor guy.

Faye Dunaway, as the real
wife, is mad as hell and threat
ens to sue Gittes. But he's just
as mad as she is that his repu
tation as photographer of
infedity could be tarnished like
this, and offers to help get to
the bottom of it.
The plot turns out to be
one of those kooky real estate
schemes, involving L.A.'s per
petual water shortage and a
bunch of orange groves the
water is secretly being rerouted
to. All in all, it's going to gross
the bad guys about $30 million.
Complicating matters
somewhat, Dunaway's husband
turns up dead after about the
first 30 minutes (drowned, of
course) and no one knows who
perpetrated his death.

Could it be Dunaway her
self, the femme fatale? Or
Dunaway's shady father (John
Huston)? Well I ain't going to
tell ya! (See the Internet Movie
Data base for further informa
tion). Nicholson is great play
ing, once again, an offbeat,
unglamorous role that subverts
conventional morality. He|

medium and close up shots
emphasize key facial expres
sions. It's obvious why Polanski
is considered the master of the
film-noir.

Go check out the film. . .
heck, if the Simpsons would
mock it ("Forget it Marge. It's
Chinatown.), you know it must
be good.

Curtain Call

by Glen Beck
Staff Writer

"In December 1962,
three members of Owl and
Nightingale accepted the chal
lenge of advisor and director,
Prof. Emile O. Schmidt, to
direct a group of scenes for
the _^ experience and joy of it.'
Scenes were chosen be the stu
dents from The Importance of
Being Ernest, The Glass Me
nagerie, and something which
bore the unlikely title of Big
Fish, Little Fish... One of
tonight's plays will serve as
the fiftieth offering under that
aegis. Fifty plays in five years.
Not bad!" - The Prompter,
December, 1967
Each November, stu
dents in the theater
department's directing class
present a series of one-act
plays varying in styles, set
tings, and playwrights.

Students from all over
campus audition, are cast, and
then work in collaboration
with the student director for
about a month's time to pro
duce a polished production.
Last year's festival of
one-acts set an all-time
record: 19 directors (from the
Fundamentals of Directing
Class) and 13 productions.
These included
Edmond, The Bear, Another
Way Out, For Whom the
Southern Belle Tolls, The
Danube, Life in Excellence
and a few others.
This year, 11 of those 19
directors moved on to Ad
vanced Directing, and are in
the process of producing 11
one-act productions.
The lab festival this year
has productions that are even
more wide-ranging in style,
staging, and choice of play
wright. Like last year, the
number of students involved
exceeds 50.

Shows include Kissing
Cousins, The Author's Voice,
The Maker of Dreams, Cham
ber Music, Snowangel, A
Slight Ache, Hello Out There,
20 Years From Now, The Mad
house, Hot -N- Throbbing,
and For All the Saints.

Conflict and Consensus
To the Editor:
the sheer fact

Put the college's best foot forward

Last year Gettysburg Col
lege was evaluated by The
Princeton Review, and I be
lieved the review poorly por
trayed our campus community.
The Princeton Review has no
standard with which it judges
a school; instead, it relies upon
opinions of students who sub
mit pertinent information.
When I first read the re
view I agreed with many of the
statements, and wrote a letter
to the editor attacking the
administration's poor handling
of the college's problems. Af
ter that, I did some research
and realized that random stu
dents had beend chosen, not a
fair sample of our student
population, and that there was
no standard with which to
cross-examine any submitted
information. As a result,
schools similar to Gettysburg,
like Dickson, and Franklin and
Marshall, all received similar
write-ups.
This seemed ridiculous to

me. Gettysburg, like so many
other schools, does have seri
ous problems with diversity,
homophobia, alchohol abuse,
rape, and other social issues.
But I do not believe that this
school is a horrible place to be.
We have the Center for
Public Service, the Women's
Center, the Intercultural Re
source Center, excellent aca
demic departments, and the
Residential College Program;
all these things make Gettys
burg a vibrant, challenging, and
wonderful place to be. I be
lieve that many students, like
myself, have become bitter and
upset with all the problems
which have gone unchecked
around us. As a result we have
expressed our bitterness in
writing, chastising our school.
I submit that we have
done nothing to help our col
lege beyond raising issues for
examination. The types of
people that are needed to
change the wrongs that plague

Gettysburg -- _intelligent
people, socially concerned
people, those that are willing
to change and challenge policy
— have been frightened off by
our horrible descriptions of
Gettysburg. This will do noth
ing to solve the problems our
bitterness has raised.
If you want to fix this
school, put your best foot for
ward. Invite in those that can
change and correct what de
stroys our community, and
show what makes our school
great as well as bad. Gettys
burg has been given the chance
to be re-evaluated by The
Princeton Review, and this time
let'sencourage those that can
help Gettysburg to enroll, not
frighten them away with bitter
ness and resentment.
Respectfully,

Charles Dittrich

A Note of Thanks:
The Staff of The Gettysburgian would
like to sincerely thank Akbar Rizvi,
Chesha Miller, Henry Fawell, Laura
Rooty Justin Etheridge, Scott Buhrman,
and everyone else who went above and
beyond to help with this issue in our
time of need. Without your support and
assistance, this issue might not have
been completed.

Consider this

This past weekend, a great
tragedy occurred within our
community. One of our own
took her life.
Whether or not you had
a close personal relationship
with the student, nearly every
one is affected by this tragedy.
As it seems with all adver
sity which a community must
face, there are lessons to be
learned, and as hard as it may
be to think about right now,
there are lessons here too.
Often , when tragedy
befalls us, there is an emotional
response of panic, confusion,
anger, and sadness.
Yet in spite of these emo
tions, there are always those
who are there for us in our time
of need—there to lend a hug, or
a shoulder to cry on, or perhaps
just a kindly smile or a caring
ear. All too often, college, like
life, becomes a fragmented ex
istence, one in which competi
tion is rampant, self interest is
predominant, and where caring
seems to be an emotion left for
only those closest to us.

This weekend, humanity
in its purest form was displayed
through a community coming
together in support of all its
members.
As a whole, the campus
community, from students to se
curity, faculty to counseling ser
vices, and chapel to college life,
all came together as a cohesive
unit. While the feelings of pain

will not fade quickly,
that someone is there to care, to
share the burden of grief, aids our
collective healing.
To the entire campus com
munity, all of those who took the
time to offer their support in any
way, a sincere and heartfelt thank
you. While we cannot change
what has already been done, we
can take measures to help try and
prevent something like this from
happening again.
Within the boundaries of
our community, there are a great
many individuals who genuinely
care, as evidenced by the wide
spread support over this past
weekend's events. How do we
find them on a regular basis?
To everyone at Gettysburg
College: reach out to someone.
Don't allow yourself to become
isolated, show someone you care.
We all have times when we
know we could have reached out
and didn't. Yet, if we all could take
that chance just once, to just go
and show someone you care un
conditionally, perhaps life would
be a little easier for all of us.

Believe in your own human
ity, take a chance on caring, only
good can come of it.
On a personal note, Casey,
you were one of us here at The
Gettysburgian. You served us as a
columnist, worked with us as a
colleague, brought us candy
Wednesday nights, but most im
portantly, you were a friend. We
will miss you in our lives and our
hearts always.

From the Donkey's Mouth

United States and China, a long road ahead

By Kelly Davis
We have all heard about
the arrival of China's Presi
dent, Jiang Zemin, to the
United States. For the past
week, you could not have
picked up a newspaper or
watched television without see
ing a nice photo-op of Presi
dent Clinton and Jiang waving
and smiling. This trip was ob
viously a big step in relations
between China and the United
States. It was the first visit to
Washington that the Chinese
president has made since the
massacre of pro-democracy
demonstrators in Beijing in
1989. It appears that this trip
was little more than a public
relations trip for China's presi
dent.

Scenes like Jiang ringing
the opening bell at the New

York Stock Exchange and visit
ing Independence Hall, show
the irony that exists within the
visit of the Chinas President.
China is by no stretch of the
imagination a democratic
country and for Jiang to visit
the birth place of democracy in
America is laughable. China
has an atrocious human rights
record and makes no excuses
for it. China is a place of reli
gious persecution, forced abor
tions, and political oppression.
When Mr. Jiang visited
the New York City he was boy
cotted by the mayor and the
governor of New York, but he
was greeted with open arms by
the business community. I
think these actions are symbolic
of US-Chinese relations. We
have become focused on the
economics of the situation.

China offers a huge market for
American businesses. It is dif
ficult for many industries not
to tap into this market regard
less of the state of human rights
in China.
Since Jiang began his
nine-day visit to the United
States in Hawaii, he has been
hounded by demonstrators
protesting China's human
rights record and its treatment
of Taiwan and Tibet. At each
stop on his trip to America, Mr.
Jiang was greeted with protests
from people appalled by the ac
tions of the Chinese govern
ment. Demonstrations were
held everywhere that the presi
dent went. From DC to
Harvard to Los Angeles, there
were protests led by US citi
zens, Chinese students, Chinese
scholars, and former political

prisoners. This was a great
opportvinity for these people to
express there dissent with the
Chinese government's prac
tices. It was a chance to voice
this to not only the Chinese but
to the US government. At this
point we have to wonder if this
voice was truly heard by either
party. When questioned about
the protests, Jiang told report
ers sometimes noises came into
my ears, but said the demon
strations would not affect
China's policies. What will
make the Chinese government
reform their policies? This
seems to be the million dollar
question that the US does not
seem to be to interested in an
swering. Although Jiang was
met with harsh criticism about
human rights issues from both

sides of the political spectrum
there was still no strong state
ment of condemnation or de
nunciation given.
Throughout his trip,
Jiang was evasive about answer
ing the questions about the
controversial issues that sur
round China. Rep. Nancy
Pelosi, a California Democrat
and leading critic of China, said
later, The questions were frank
but he wasn't frank in respond
ing. He was evasive but engag
ing. In other words, he re
sponded but he did not an
swer". These evasive tactics
seemed to be acceptable to the
politicians. It was as if the poli
ticians were making the obliga
tory censure of the Chinese
government but did not expect

by Erin Patterson and Kevin
Howard Public Relations Chairs - Panhel
and IFC This week the Gettysburg
College community was
shocked by the loss of Casey
Dunn. She will be in the
thoughts and prayers of the
Greek students here at Gettys
burg. Casey was an Alpha Xi
Delta sister and was very active
on campus. To say that she will
be sorely missed is an under
statement. Our deepest condo
lences go out to all of Casey's
friends and family.
All First Year students in
terested in rushing a fraternity
or sorority next semester need

to register for rush. Registra
tion will be held on Tuesday,
November 11 at 8:00pm in the
CUB Ballroom. Registration
costs $5.00 so dont forget to
bring your wallet, it'll be the
best five bucks you will spend
all year. In addition to regis
tering for rush, there is an
added bonus of hearing Matt
Supple speak on the benefits of
joining a Greek organization.
From what we hear, he is an
excellent speaker with a lot of
great things to say, so don't miss
it! This Friday, Delta
Gamma will hold their annual
Anchor Splash at 7:00 at the
pool which is located in the
CUB. All proceeds from this

fundraiser will benefit Aides for
the Blind. Come out and sup
port this worthy cause.
Many thanks are in order
to Kristen Hess. Due to unfor
tunate circumstances, Kristen
has had to resign from her po
sition as Panhellenic Council
President. Over the past year,
Kristen has had a profound
impact on Greek life here at
Gettysburg. All our thanks and
appreciation go out to Kristen
on a job very well done! Abby
Rodgers will take over for the
remainder of the semester.
First Year guys, that rush
booklet that we've been prom
ising you will finally arrive in
your mailboxes by this Friday,
so keep a look out for it. Once

again, it will contain informa
tion concerning each fraternity
on rampus. It will be a great
guide to help you out through
rush. Next Monday, November
10, Dave Westol - the Execu
tive Director of Theta Chi - will
be speaking in the Chapel at
9:00pm. He will be speaking
about the advantages of being
Greek, and is Nationally
known for his speeches. In
fact, he is arguably the best
there is about promoting a
Greek system on a college cam
pus. This is a meeting that has
been made mandatory for all
Greek men, and is highly rec
ommended for everyone else
on campus.

Gettysburg - get ready to
rock! On November 8, the first
ever all campus wide party will
be held directly behind Alpha
Tau Omega. If you don't know
where that is, get a map, or ask
a friend because it should'nt be
missed. There will be bands
playing and people every
where, so be sure not to be left
out. We want to make it clear
that this event is not limited to
certain people on campus -
EVERYONE is on the guest list!
There will be no negging at the
door, or walks around the
block. Everyone gets in, and
everyone parties for free. This
is not a BYOB event, in fact
there will be no alcoholic bev
erages within the party area so
don't bring any.



Conflict and Consensus
The Pachyderm's Pulpit

Elephant's on parade

by John Dunlap
The headlines seem to tell
the story, once again a GOP
sweep. In 1993, the Republi
can Party captured the Gover
norships of the State of New
Jersey and the Commonwealth
of Virginia, as well as taking the
mayor's office in the nations
largest city, New York. That
was a precursor for the Repub
lican tidal wave that rocked the
nation in 1994 when the Re
publican Party captured Con
gress for the first time in 40
years, while winning a major
ity of governor's races across
the country. Now as Demo
crats hope to retake Congress
in 1998, Republican victories
in election '97 must now dash
their hopes.

This week the Republican
Party was not only able to
maintain their hold on various
seats but also strengthen their
position. For the first time in
history the Governor, Lieuten
ant Governor, and the Attorney
General of Virginia will all be
republican, a first not only for
Virginia but for the entire
south. Republicans seem now
to have clinched their southern
base. With their hold on the
south, republicans had to con
centrate on the northeast
where President Clinton took
the entire region last year. This
past Tuesday, republican candi
dates were reelected because

they kept their promises.
Mayor Rudolph Guiliani was
the choice for the Big Apple
once again. In 1993, the
former prosecutor promised to
bring down crime and he did
just that. Crime has fallen by
half in New York City as Mayor
Guiliani used basic republican
principles in getting tough on
crime. He showed leadership
and in a city that has a 5 to 1
democrat edge, Mayor Rudy
defeated his democratic oppo
nent, Ruth Messinger 57% to

41%. In the race to fill Susan
Molinari's seat in Congress, re
publican Vito Fossella, crushed
the democrat, Eric Vitaliano
who early on had the lead in
the polls. The 32 year-old
Fossella took 62% of the vote
against the democrat New York
assemblyman Vitaliano. Once
again, democrats tried to attack
the Speaker of the House,
Newt Gingrich, but it failed just
as it did last year. The agenda
that Democrats have labeled

the Gingrich agenda is popu
lar; people want less govern
ment and fewer taxes. Repub
licans promised that and deliv
ered. The Speaker's personal
popularity may not be high but
his ideas and vision are winning
the day.
In the closest race of the
night in New Jersey, the people
of the Garden State gave Gov¬

ernor Christine Todd
Whitman four more years.
Governor Whitman narrowly
defeated her democrat oppo
nent, State Senator Jim
McGreevey, 47% to 46% but
the close race not only came
from Mr. McGreevey who
ran a great campaign but
from the right. The closeness
of the Whitman race shows
that while Republicans
should and must reach out
beyond their base they can
not forget those who put
them where they are, the con
servative religious element of

the party. A total of 7% of
the voters in New Jersey sup
ported two pro-life third
party candidates. Conserva
tives groups refused to sup
port the Governor and in the
last days of the campaign she
had to bring conservatives
home. Last year republican
candidates who lost were
those who forgot the base
and lost their most solid sup
porters. If you put
Whitman's 47% with the 7%
pro-life vote than even in
Democratic New Jersey con
servative ideas are doing well
on the local level.

When one looks at the
campaigns of the candidates
it is clearly visible that the
GOP message is still carrying
the day. It won in 1993,
1994, and even 1996 when

President Clinton joined the bud
get balancing, tax-cutting, wel
fare reforming bandwagon.
Taxes were the big issue this week
and the anti-tax feeling that has
existed since the Boston tea party
is still alive and well. Tax cuts
work, they grow the economy
and increase revenues into the
government. Virginia's Repub
lican Nominee for Governor, Jim
Gilmore promised to eliminate
the personal property tax on cars
and trucks in his campaign and
the voters rallied to his side.
When Mr. Gilmore began his
campaign he was behind his
Democrat opponent, Lieutenant
Governor Don Beyer but he set
the campaign's agenda and Mr.
Beyer's scare tactics of saying that
Gilmore would cut education
failed. Democrats try to scare the
people into electing them, what
they need is a positive message
or they will be out of power in
the states and in the Congress for
a long time.

For those who say that
Governor-elect Gilmore will not
be able to cut taxes, they need
only to go up the road where
Christie Whitman ran on a
pledge to cut personal income
taxes by 30% in three years. She
did it in two years and the rate
of growth in property taxes has
increased at a lower rate than
they did under the man she de
feated four years ago, Governor
Jim Florio, who gave the state its

largest tax increase in history.
What makes election '97
even more interesting is that
President Clinton campaigned
in every major race for the
democrats and everywhere he
went democrats lost. Today
campaign fund-raising scandals
have bankrupted the Demo
cratic Party. Democrats are in
debt and were unable to com
pete with the Republican's le
gal raising and spending of
money. The party is bereft of
ideas and that showed when

the former Virginia Democratic
Party chairman, Paul Goldman
upon seeing the democratic
rout in told the Washington
Post, "The high command of
the Democratic Party, has cre
ated a party that doesn't debate
the issues, that is devoid of in
tellectual content." Republi
cans should not be afraid of
their agenda; the GOP does not
have to cater to the liberal spe
cial interest groups, when Re
publicans cave they lose. Presi
dent Bush when he raised taxes
is evidence of that.

Through Election '97 re
publicans have their playbook
for 1998, cut taxes, fight crime,
keep your promises, and unite
the party. That is the recipe not
only to hold on to Congress but
also to increase the republican
majority in both of house of the
Congress as well as in the
states.



Donkey

anything to come from it.
Why is the American
government only paying lip
service to the subject of hu
man rights violations? Unfor
tunately it seems that the dol
lar has become more impor
tant than our moral integrity
as a country. Cuba has been

guilty of extremely similar hu
man rights violations and the
United States has taken a strong
stand in opposition. We have
refused to support the oppres
sive regime there. Why the
contradiction? Policy toward
China has been largely shaped
by a US business lobby eager to

continued from page 12
tap that enormous market.
If we as a nation have
become unable to stand up
for our beliefs, then we have
lost a great deal of strength
as a nation. If we, as the sole
remaining world-power, are
unable to stand up for what
we believe in then who will?

Jiang has stated that It is natu
ral for our two countries to hold
different views on some issues.
The concepts on democracy, hu
man rights and freedoms are rela
tive and specific ones," he said.
Human rights are not a relative
issue. There are certain rights
that every human being is en¬

titled to regardless of citizen
ship. The United States needs
to be more active and asser
tive in its actions to improve
human rights conditions both
domestically and globally. As
part of that, it is necessary to
stand up to and pressure ob
vious human rights violators

College drafts new
sexual assault policy

by Daniel Larkin
News Editor

Over the past few weeks, the College has proposed a
revision to the current policy concerning sexual assault.
These proposed changes resulted from a campus-wide
"Day of Dialogue" held in the spring of 1996 to discuss con
cerns about sexual assault on campus.
There had been increasing incidents of sexual assault
on campus and students were particularly concerned about a
number of issues. These included campus policies regarding
sexual assault, communication and support issues, and the need
for increased educational programs.
These discussions resulted in a number of new programs.
An anonymous report form was developed to make the re
porting of incidents more likely. A rape defense for women
was initiated. And passive educational efforts, such as the
Red Zone Posters, were increased significantly.
But the most import change was the revision of the ex
isting Sexual Assault Policy.
The current policy, as written in the Student Handbook
states "Sexual assault is defined as threats of or deliberate
physical contact of, a sexual nature which is against another
person's will or consent."
The proposed draft of the new policy, called the "Posi
tive Consent Policy," makes a number of significant changes
to the existing rules. The proposal was drafted by a commit
tee that included students Travis Kreider, Chris Killam,
Carolyn Holmes, and Kim Tracy.
Perhaps the most important change proposed to the
policy is the provision that "Verbal Consent must be clear and
affirmative."
This change would eliminate the idea that consent is
implied unless "No" is clearly stated. Positive consent re
quires a "Yes", or other affirmative statement.
According to Dean of the College Julie Ramsey, inci
dents of sexual assault are "often the result of miscommuni
cation between men and women."
Dean Ramsey feels that the proposed policy will elimi
nate many of the ambiguities that exist in the present system,
and help to create an environment of "consensual, responsible
intimacy."

Security to merge with College Life

by Henry Fawell
Staff Writer For the past several
months, Gettysburg College
has considered moving the
Safety and Security office from
its present branch of operation
the Finance and Administra
tion office, to a new, more rea
sonable branch, namely the
College Life Division.
The college felt that,
since the majority of the issues
faced by Safety and Security
deal with the welfare of stu
dents, integrating the office
into the Administration of Col
lege Life would make better
sense. In the past, Gettysburg's

I want my GCTV!

Student group
by Laura Root
Staff Writer , _
After years of inactivity,
the Gettysburg College Televi
sion (GCTV) station is being
launched back into action.
A committee led by stu
dents Matt Bange, Mike Wooden,
Jen Misluk, and Jason Bresky has
taken on the task of installing a
cable television station network,
with hopes of putting shows on
the air by the beginning of the
spring semester.
The group began working
on its idea last September. They
started by investigating the past
history of a television station at
Gettysburg College.

Their detective work re
vealed that the College does have
a cable television installation
available on Channels Four and
Five, although it is currently in
active. They also uncovered a

relaunches College television station

small amount of equipment, in
cluding an editor, television cam
eras, and cable lines.
The minimal equipment
only causes one hindrance in the
station's growth - programs will
not be able to be seen at any place
not located on the gettysburg
College campus. This includes
Paxton and Criterion Halls, Lamp
Post, fraternity houses, and apart
ments.
The problem does have the
potential to be quickly remedied
, though. Student support of
GCTV can raise money so that
its creators will be able to buy
more equipment.
Currently, six students and
five faculty members head the
GCTV Revival Committee. The
Committee held its first meeting
last Monday, and 45 interested
students attended.

Concerned students have a
chance to run for positions on the

Executive Board of GCTV. The
Executive Board is comprised of
a Station Director who directs the
Executive Committee and keeps
track of the budget; a General
Electrician who gives mainte
nance to the equipment, pur
chases the equipment, and trains
new members of the board; a Pro
duction Manager in charge of
keeping track of the comings and
goings of the equipment; a Train
ing Director who trains new
GCTV members; a Review Com
mittee Director who is respon
sible for the coordination of the
different teams of GCTV; a Pro
duction Coordinator in charge of
the television station's schedule;
and a Public Relations Director
who is responsible for the
station's relationship with all
other campus organizations.

GCTV will begin opera
tions by organizing its members
into teams. Each team will un¬

dergo training and produce its
own program.
The programs do not have
to follow a specific subject - the
station isopen to any idea. Pos
sibilities include news shows,
professors' lectures, and sports
events. The output will be en
tirely student based.
"The best part about GCTV
is the creativity and freedom that
it allows," says Matt Bange, one
of the leaders of this new project.
GCTV plans to show its
first installment of programming
by the beginning of the spring
semester. The shows will be aired
between 7:00 p.m. and 10:00
p.m., which is considered to be
prime viewing time for students.
GCTV will hold its next
meeting on Monday, November
17 at 9:00 p.m. in CUB 260. Any
interested students are welcome
to attend.

Security -
from page 2

Safety and Security office has
worked closely with several dif
ferent branches within the Col
lege, particularly College Life,
despite its affiliation with Fi
nance and Administration.
Therefore, beginning June
1, 1998, the Safety and Security
office will begin operation under
the Dean of the College. Mike
Webster, who previously super
vised a similar transition at West
ern Maryland College, has been
hired by Gettysburg to help en
sure that Safety and Security's
transition between the two offices
runs smoothly.
Jennie Mingolelli, Vice
President for Finance and Admin
istration feels that, "Through this
restructuring, the staffs of Secu
rity, Residential Life, Facilities
Services and Risk Management
will be able to achieve a more in
tegrated approach to providing a
safe campus environment."

Timon Linn,-the former
supervisor of the Safety and Se¬

curity office, will stay on at
Gettysburg College, but in a new
position.
Beginning January first,
Linn will assume the duties of the
Director of Environmental Safety
Services, which oversees envi
ronmental safety, fire safety pro
cedures and a number of other is
sues. The College hopes to find
a new Director of Safety and Se
curity Services by the January
first transition date.
Gettysburg College has
also emphasized that no layoffs
will be made during the transi
tion period, nor will the College
alter any of the procedures pres
ently used by the office of Safety
and Security.
If the transition proceeds as
envisioned, Mingolelli believes,
"this realignment of responsibili
ties will provide a more robust
institutional safety program." 1

from page 1

The proposed drarf
also states that "Verbal Con
sent is an ongoing process.
If the amount or kind of
sexual intimacy changes dur
ing an interaction (i.e., if two
people move from kissing
while fully clothed, which is
one level, to undressing for
direct physical contact,
which is another level), the
people involved need to ex
press their clear and verbal
consent before moving on to
the new level."
The draft also aims to
clear up the ambiguities in
the policy concerning alco
hol and drugs. It states "If
you have sex with someone
who is intoxicated or
drugged, even if they stated
yes, you may still be charged
with sexual misconduct."

The proposed policy
has been brought forward for
debate and discussion to
many student groups includ
ing Student Senate, several

residence halls, and each
Sorority and Fraternity.
According to
Ramsey, student reaction to
the policy has been mixed.
Some students have wel
comed the proposed
changes, while others have
been "skeptical and defen
sive," she said.
Dean Ramsey called
the proposed policy "pretty
progressive." Most colleges
have policies comparable
with Gettysburg's current
policy, though some
schools, including
Georgetown and Antioch
have implemented simi
larly progressive policies.
The policy will likely
undergo many revisions
before it is finally imple
mented. Ramsey stated
that she believed any
changes that will be made
will not become policy un
til the Fall of 1998.

tyrate, or GHB.
Only recently has GHB
has come to the public's atten
tion. Both Rohypnol and GHB
are sedatives increasingly being
used as date rape drugs. They
both act as an anti-depressant
in the body. The rapid rise in
cases of date rape by the use of
GHB has fueled much attention
to the drug lately. It is to the

point where even Oprah did a
show about it a few weeks ago.
GHB is a white, odorless
pill that dissolves quickly into
drinks. It's also known as Liq
uid E, Gamma-OH, and Easy
Lay. It has much the same ef
fect on the body as roofies.
When ingested, it is known to
cause sleepiness and vulnerabil
ity. It has even been dubbed
"liquid ecstasy." It's highly con
centrated street form is avail
able, as a liquid, in small plas
tic bottles about the size and
shape of a hotel shampoo
bottle. One dosage is usually a
capful. There are approxi
mately 9 hits per bottle, and at
$10 a bottle, not only is this
drug potent, but it's very cheap,

too. It has many of the same
effects upon the body as alco
hol. It lowers inhibitions, im
pairs motor skills and thought
processes. It is considered
worse to drive when using
GHB than after drinking.
If ingested in too high a
dosage, it has the same effects
as alcohol on the body. Spe
cific examples are blackouts,
amnesia, and difficulty speak
ing. Originally used as an an¬

esthetic, it is usually sold in
small tablets.
Like roofies, it turns col
orless, odorless, and is salty
tasting when mixed with a liq
uid. Part of the reason it is so
dangerous is because you can
not see or smell it in the drink.

No hal
lucinations occur that
would sug
gest some
thing is
wrong, and
the effects of
the drugs can
take effect in
twenty to
thirty min
utes. The ef
fects can last
up to four

hours after
the initial
dosage.
On its
own, GHB
can be dan
gerous, but
when mixed
with alcohol,
the effects are
doubled.
Since both
are sedatives,
mixed to
gether they
can lead to

unconscious
ness, comas,
and in the
worst cases,
death. A few
weekends

A slip of the wrist is all it takes to drug an unsuspecting victim.

ago on the campus of Syracuse
University, what appears to be
a GHB related rape occurred.
Allegedly the girl in
volved woke up several hours
after a party to find herself
wrapped in plastic outside of
a dorm without any knowl
edge of what had happened to
her. Unfortunately, GHB
completely breaks down in a

few hours. After that there is no
trace to be found in the body.
Trying to prove a case without
this crucial evidence is almost
impossible.
This happens frequently
with GHB due to the blackouts
and coma-like state it induces.

Victims might be unable
to identify the events surround
ing the rape. Is it also difficult
to know how to stop the drug
from taking effect, since it acts
so quickly.
This widespread use of
date rape drugs, and more spe
cifically, GHB, has led legisla
tors to introduce several bills
that would impact the status of
GHB.

Many states have moved
to criminalize GHB, as Florida,
Georgia, and Rhode Island
have already done. In these
states the manufacturing or
selling of GHB is punishable by
a fifteen-year sentence and a
twenty thousand dollar fine.

Presi
d e n t
Clinton signed a
measure in
1996 called
the "Drug
Induced Rape Pre
vention and
Punishment Act of
19 9 6."
This act im
poses a

prison sen
tence of up
to twenty
years for
distribution of this drug
to anyone
without his
or her con
sent and
knowledge
in order to
commit sexual as
sault.

U n -
fortunately,
it is very dif
ficult to
completely
rid the
country of
this drug

because information on it and
how it is made are readily and
easily available. There are even
ingredients and recipes avail
able on the Internet.
Many people also push to
keep GHB in the country be
cause it does have some ben
eficial qualities. It is useful to
certain extents in psycho
therapy, muscle development
and an anesthesia.

Though this drug may be
safe under strict supervision, it
has such an exact dosage that
it is dangerous anywhere else.
This is why the drug has never
been legal for use within the
United States.
The FDA has put out sev
eral warnings about GHB in the
last few years. They tell of how
GHB can be linked to a blood
disorder, and how the drug has
not been approved.
Nothing seems to allevi
ate the problem, because it can
still be bought in catalogues,
body building gyms, and even
health food stores.
Lawmakers have tried
successfully in many situations
to categorize GHB in the same
ways as alcohol. Under the in
fluence of GHB, both sex and/
or sexual contact is illegal.

The premise behind this
is that under the influence of
both alcohol and GHB, the per
son is impaired mentally as well
as physically. In a comatose
state, the victim has no defense
whatsoever.
These facts can seem very
scary. To think that someone,
at any given time, could slip
something into your system
that would make you com
pletely defenseless, is terrifying.
Fortunately, there is good
advice about dealing with these
drugs. Investigators of date
rapes committed with the use
of GHB or roofies say that the
best defense a person has
against being a victim is them
selves.
Trust your own instinct,
and if something seems to be
going wrong, it probably is. In
tough situations, call on a
friend or make as much of a

scene as possible. Never leave
a drink unattended, and do not
accept drinks from people you
do not trust completely.
The chances of being
raped with the use of drugs are
minimized if one uses their own
intuition and common sense.



Olmos delivers in a lifetime of work

by Jon _Froehlich
Staff Writer
Born on February 21.
1946, Edward James Olmos,
this year's Fall Convocation
speaker, has become one of
America's most influential His
panic actors.
Though Olmos made his
entrance into the public domain
through his starnng role as
Lieutenant Maitin Castillo on
the hit TV cop show Miami
Vice, there were many other
important projects both before
and after this that made Olmos
the person and actor that he is
today. Growing up in Boyle
Heights, a Hispanic neighbor
hood in East Los Angeles,
Olmos experienced a pro
nounced Mexican heritage of
many generations. As one can
see from many of Olmos' roles,
his strong ethnic background
stuck with him throughout the
years.

At the age of 13, Olmos
became convinced, through su
per-stars like James Brown and
Little Richard, that he was des-

For rules, see the off campus bulletin board
at the Student Union or call for information

tined for a career involving
singing and dancing. Unlike
many teens with similar aspi
rations to dedicate themselves
to the performing aits, Olmos'
dream became a reality in 1968
when his band, Eddie and the
Pacific Ocean, became the
house band at private Sunset
Drive club, The Factory.
Somehow knowing that
the success of his band would
not get him where he wanted
to go, Olmos began attending
classes at California State Uni
versity during the day and still
performed with his band at
night. Though at first inter
ested in the social sciences,
Olmos eventually moved to
wards what seemed his destiny
- theater and dance.

Tiding himself over un
til his inevitable big break,
Olmos, while also delivering
antique furniture on the side,
picked up small roles in shows
like Hawaii Five-0 and Kojak.
After another token part in the
1975 movie aloha, bobby and
rose, Olmos got the chance to
play what was to be a life-

changing role.
At age 31, Olmos was of
fered a role in the street play
Zoot Suit. Opening in 1978 to
last only ten days, Zoot Suit
went on to have a run that
lasted over a year and a hall
until finally ending with a short
stint on Broadway. Proclaimed
by Olmos to be "the first real

A-

play about Latinos," Zoot
Suit earned a Tony nomination.
Olmos' life took another
interesting turn when he was
offered the role of a Native
American high steel worker in
the movie Wolfen. Though he
at first turned the part down,
insisting that the director cast
a true Native American, he
eventually took it after getting
official permission from The
American Indian Movement
(AIM). This act not only
earned Olmos an AIM humani
tarian award, but it points out

Olmos's extreme concern for
the preservation on ethnic and
national identity that he applies
to his own heritage and cultural
life. Much of the next few
years of Olmos's life were
taken up by Robert Young's
1983 movie, The Ballad of
Gregario >Cortez - a true story
of a Mexican farm hand falsely
accused of murder in Texas.
Through massive promo
tion of this film, Olmos not
only helped to be sure that this
story was told properly, but he

also did much to heighten His
panic pride throughout the
United States.
The next big project for
Olmos came with Miami Vice.
Also starring the smooth- talk
ing Don Johnson. This, one of
Olmos's most famous roles, ran
for five years and earned him
an Emmy and a Golden Globe
for Best Sup¬

porting Actor
in a Continu
ing Drama
Scries. Mi
._^ a in i

also offered Olmos his direc
torial debut with what is often
considered the very best epi
sode of the whole series -
Bushido.
Olmos would go on to
direct other films after this TV
episode, such as the story of a
Hispanic family, American Me,
in 1992.
Perhaps one of Olmos's
most loved and important roles
was his portrayal of Bolivian
born math teacher in the 1988
film:

Stand and Deliver
"You already have two
strikes against you. There are
some people in this world who
will assume you know less than
you do because of your name
and your complexion. But
math is the great equalizer." -
Jamie Escalante
From the first scene of
Stand and Deliver, Olmos's se
riousness and dedication to
both acting and teaching are
apparent. The movie hit audi
ences hard and fast with a pic¬

ture of Hispanic pride that has
been, and continues to be, a
strong theme in Olmos's life.
Olmos offers a genuine
and enthusiastic performance
in the role of math teacher
Jamie Escalante. In the same
genre as such movies as Dan
gerous Minds and Lean on Me ,
Escalante enters a new job in
the under-funded and disre
spected Garfield High School.
Set in East L.A., both the
school and neighborhood in
Stand and Deliver are similar to
those that Olmos faced grow
ing up.
As he is ready to break all
the rules, Escalante takes it as
his personal mission to take his
basic math class far beyond
what is expected of them by
preparing them to pass the Ad
vanced Placement Calculus
test.

In the process, he not
only teaches his students math,
but also the ethnic and personal
pride that he knows they will
need to succeed.
The movie takes on real
meaning when Escalante him
self is faced with failure - as his
students, after many dedicated
hours of summer school, have
all passed the AP test, but are
accused of cheating.
But when the students
have enough confidence to re
take the test, it is clear that
Escalante has actually suc
ceeded.
However, Stand and De
liver focuses its attention on the
students as well as the teacher.
With one of the biggest
names being Lou Diamond
Phillips, who starred in La
Bamba (another movie con
cerned with Hispanic life),
Stand and Deliver probes the
lives of Escalante's students
who face obstacles at home as
well as at school.

This latest movie from
director Ramon Menendez
(Money for Nothing) contains
excellent performances by both
Olmos and Phillips and offers
a serious but fun story which
communicates an up-lifting
message.




Cheerio. London: Hello. Essex

by Mark Berg
England Correspondent
The study abroad pro
gram in England began in late
August with a seminar called
"Mad Women, Fallen Women,
New Women, and Other
Women: 19th Century British
Women," taught by Professor
Temma Berg.
Appropriately, the fifteen
students lived in the George
Hotel in Cartwright Gardens,
a crescent of Georgian build
ings near Russell Square in
Bloomsbury.
Bloomsbury is in a (rela
tively) quiet section of London.
The hotel is two blocks from
the tube and several bus lines,
close to the Euston and King's
Cross train stations, one long
block from a Safeway super
market and gourmet mini
mart, near fish and chips res
taurants and several pubs, and
around the corner from that

most essential establishment, a
laundromat.
And then the program

moved to the University of
Essex.
The University of Essex is
in Wivenhoe Park, near
Colchester, an hour's train ride
from London, but worlds
apart. Wivenhoe proper is a
small village on the River
Colne, with a small port, a train
station, and (what else?) several
pubs. The pub is the neighbor
hood social center, where you
can nurse a pint of ale until
closing time. I think one of the
reasons there are so many pubs
is the strict law against drunk
driving in Britain; there's al
ways a pub within walking dis
tance. Colchester, the oldest re
corded city in England and
once the largest civilian city of
Roman England, has a popula
tion of less than 100,000, but
has lots and lots of shops, and
many pubs.

At the University, each of
the Gettysburg students took
four courses of his or her

choice, while Professor Berg
taught a class called "Roman
tics to Moderns" in the Depart
ment of Literature. Even I'm
sitting in on two history
courses.
The approach to teaching
here is very different from the
American approach. Most
courses consist of a lecture once
a week, followed by separate
classes, which may or may not
take place immediately after
the lecture.
The lecture is exactly
that: a monologue by the pro
fessor, who rarely asks or takes
questions from the students. In
my history courses, each class
contains about half of the stu
dents and is interactive, with
the professor stimulating the
discussion by asking questions
related to the lecture.

The University of Essex
was built in the 1960's, a time
when the British university sys
tem expanded considerably. It
is small for a university here,
with 5,550 students, a large

number of which come from
about 110 other countries; you
can walk around campus and
not hear a word of English.
That's not entirely accu
rate; it's just that you can't un
derstand even the British stu
dents sometimes. Example: in
Professor Berg's class, a student
said that a poem was
"pahstrool." After further dis
cussion, she realized he had
said "pastoral."
The campus is on 200
pahstrool acres. The academic

buildings, however, do not live
up to the setting. It was a bold
design: 5 open courts created
by linked buildings descending
down a slope.
But it's too much con
crete (no bricks at all), much
too cold. And, because the
buildings are interconnected,
the room numbering scheme is,
well, let's just say I wonder
what they were smoking when
they came up with it. For ex
ample, one of my history lec
tures is in 5N3.7, and the class

that follows is in 2.403. You
can walk from one to the other
without going outside; I just
follow the professor.
On the sides of the courts
are a post office (which also
handles dry cleaning and film
processing), a student travel
agency, banks, and "the largest
Students' Union Bar in East
Anglia" (legal drinking age
18). The residences, north and
south of the academic build
ings, consist of six 14 or 15
story towers and a number of
2 or 3 story dormitories.
There is also a mini-mart
on one of the courts, but for
real food shopping, it's Tesco,
sort of like a huge Weis/Giant.
It is, however, about a mile
away, by walking or by bus,
depending on how much you
have to buy and the weather.

And because Wivenhoe
and Colchester themselves are
about 2-3 miles away in oppo
site directions, we've all be
come acquainted with bus
schedules.


Time to call the Orkin man

by Jon Froehlich
Staff Writer
To put it simply, Starship
Troopers is an entertaining
movie.
I know what you're
thinking and, to answer you,
yes, Starship Troopers is the
movie about the over-sized
bugs at war with a futuristic
human race. But you'll notice
'
this movie as "good." The truth
, , talking
about movies, we use the words

"good" and "entertaining" in
terchangeably. But, there is a
profound and important differ
ence. Much of the time, for a
film to be considered "good"
by those who make it their busi
ness to review movies, it has to
be The Piano or The English
Patient. Starship Troopers is
neither of these. It is not artis
tic, it isn't terribly insightful
and it is definitely not going to
be up for Best Picture this year.
But, it is undeniably "entertain-

Beginning and ending
with a surprisingly creative
farce of an armed services re¬

cruiting commercial that one
might see on futuristic Monday
Night Football (which with any
luck will still be around by the
time big bugs begin taking
over), Starship Troop- ^^^^
ers plays it smart by _HJU
not taking itself too I
seriously. From the I
very beginning, audi- I
ences will most likely I
Starship
Troopers is really a I
.
This is not to I
say that it utilizes I
slapstick comedy as I a
in movies like The I m
Naked Gun, but it I I
does have a subtle I I
humor to it. By mak- I _^^
ing viewers laugh at _^^^H
the pure absurdity of _^^^H
many of the situa- _^^^M
tions, it makes it easy
for us to just sit back and enjoy
the movie for what is - and not
what it isn't.

The fact is, when taken at
face value, Starship Troopers is
a pretty good movie.
The plot is fairly simple
and, if you think about it too
much, you will most likely

question why you spent your
money to see this. So my ad
vice is, don't think - just watch.
Basically, a new race of
large arachnids is taking over
the uni¬

verse and threat
ening human life as we know.
Though an alien species
threatening Earth is by no
means a novel concept, direc
tor Paul Verhoven (Showgirls,
Robocop) does a pretty good
job making it seem almost revo
lutionary.

Using special effects that
will make audiences feel that
they've stumbled into a two
hour Epcot Center exhibit,
Starship Troopers seems a fresh
and fun movie that recog¬

nizes that what it proposes
to viewers is, like many sci
ence fiction movies, not
even close to conceivable.

i*\ with Johnny Rico as

IVn "«""" _;
|H L_^_l slightly less
whiny ver¬

sion of Luke Skywalker,
all we really get is a Baywatch
lifeguard with a military uni
form slapped on him.
Nevertheless, audiences
will more than likely find Rico
to be, though a little cheesy, an
amiable star for this movie.

Through Rico and co-star Neil
Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser
M.D.), Starship Troopers takes
a quick look at many of the di
lemmas faced by a young man
during war time.
Though Van Dien is pres
ently an unknown, he will no
doubt cash in on his good looks
in the near future with the three
projects he has planned for
1998. After all, he has co
starred on Beverly Hills 90210
- he's already half way there.
Though it is easy to be
snobbish about a movie that
contains battle cries of "Bugs!
Bugs!," Starship Troopers can be
enjoyed if considered with the
right attitude.
Though in some of the
battle scenes the weightless at
mosphere doesn't seem to be an
issue and we see soldiers run
ning around unhindered by
bocce -ball sized holes in their
bodies, it is still easy to have a
good time with this movie.

If Starship Troopers is
watched with the outlook
which was meant for it, it will
no doubt be a huge crowd
pleaser.

You were a stranger to my eyes
But I know you touched a lot of lives
I wish I had a chance to hold your hand
To be with you in your difficult times
No one knows why you took your life
I do not question, no reasons why
I pray to God for you every night
For families and friends you left behind
Wherever you may be right now
Remember you left some tears behind
Within the hearts of your friends and peers
Those that cared and loved you dearly
Take care and rest in peace.

Be Your Own Best Defense

Being responsible for
by Jay Spiese
Contributing Writer
No matter how hard I
pray, no matter how much we
want to deny it, no matter how
many times it happens before,
someone on this campus will be
raped this year. As a freshman
last year I and my classmates
learned about the previous
springs events. Knowing that
a rape had happened made
many of us sensitive for the first
month or so. Afterwards the
possibility of rape was a threat
as intangible as the ghost sto-
ries I tell. Last year at this time
i was rudely shaken to hear
from a close friend that she had
been raped at a fraternity party.
Two days later another woman
wrote anonymous emails
claiming she had also been
raped. And the tragedy went
on.

Over much of this semes
ter I have thought about how
and why this can happen on
our campus. Before sitting
d,own to write this article I con
sulted with many people from
administration on down to stu
dents. Everything I see and
hear points to one conclusion.
The education end is not lack
ing, it's the action end that is.

yourself is the best solution

8 C r Each year the Freshmen
class is bombarded with rape
education programs. CHEERS
does one during orientation
week. Wellness classes cover it
to varying degrees. Special
speakers come in and occasion
ally classes are required to at
tend their lectures. Our hall
ways bare posters warning
about the chance of rape. I can
go on citing organizations, in
dividuals, and programs which
provide the information on
rape. Clearly education is not
lacking and I must applaud

_^ na ' cr '
_^
ca that. But our weakness in this
fight is on the action side. I
have found that in every case I
know of on this campus, cer
tain characteristics are com
mon. The woman and often
the attacker as well are intoxi
cated. No one is looking out
for the victim when sKe's at a
party. The woman believe they
were unable to fight their at
tacker. I put together six abso
lute truths about rape that if
taken to heart will decrease
your chances of being raped.

1.) Rape DOES happen
here. We often live in a bubble
on campus. Occasionally we
hear that it can happen here. I

am telling you it does. I know
at least three people personally
who were raped here in the
past two years. I am sure I
know many more who were
raped but do not let it show.
Sadly, before Christmas break
I can guarantee many freshmen
will find out a friend of theirs
was raped.
2.) Rape can happen to
you. Only the attacker knows
who is being targeted. You
don't know if this guy you met
at a party can be trusted. You
don't know if he slipped some
thing in your drink. Woman

must accept that they can be
come victims. It doesn't mat
ter how popular you are or
what sorority you belong to.
You are still a potential victim.
3.) You need to keep your
wits about you to avoid becom
ing a victim. Anything that
numbs your wits and slows
your reaction is dangerous. Act
responsibly when you drink. If
you want to have a drink go
ahead, but don't drink with the
intention of getting drunk.
Also drink with responsible
friends. Even better if you go
to a party designate someone
who won't drink but will watch
out for the others. I heard from

one woman how she and some
of her friends went out to a
party. They were going to
watch out for each other. Af
ter a few minutes and a few
drinks, they became more con
cerned about their personal
enjoyment. Unfortunately for
her, no one noticed when she
was grabbed by a drunk and
pushed into a room.
4.) The best defense is a
strong offense. This is a real
ity in life and in football. This
campus offers courses in self
defense at little or no charge.

There _aje two organized mar
tial arts clubs on campus,
Cuong Nhu and Tae Kwon Do.
In the bare year that I have
taken Cuong Nhu I learned
that size and strength cannot
match skill. So do not think
you aren't big enough or strong
enough. There are always op
tions. Additionally the RAD
program is offered. RAD
teaches ways to strike vulner
able points on the male body
allowing you to escape. Which
ever you choose, I must advise
you go into it with a full com¬

mitment.
5.) You are the only per
son who can prevent a rape
There will not always be a gal

lant knight waiting for a cry of
distress. No one will come to
your aid unless you take the
first steps. Make noise. Fight
back however you can, when
ever you can, with whatever
you can. Gouge eyes, pull hair,
punch, kick, just don't give up.
The moment you stop fighting
is the moment you will be
raped. I can't describe how
appalled I am to hear that
women are being taught, "If I
fight back he will only hurt me
more."
6.) There are stronger
ways of saying no than just say
ing "no". According to some of
the people I consulted, many of
the rapes on this campus are
not intentional crimes. The
attacker is usually too drunk to
understand that a woman really
doesn't want to have sex. In a
state like this he needs a clear
unambiguous no. Remember
a swift kick to the groin says a
lot very quickly.

I hope that some people
will take this to heart, but in
reality Gettysburg is very apa
thetic. No one attempts to
remedy a problem until it is
public and serious. By then it
is too late for someone.

by Erin Patterson and Kevin
Howard Public Relations Chairs Panhel
and IFC We just want to thank
everyone who came out and
registered for rush this past
Tuesday. We hope you could
find it in your budget to cough
up the five bucks, but we prom
ise it will be very much worth
it. If for some reason you for
got about registration, don't
worry, we figured there would
have been a few of you out
there, so there will be another

rush registration sometime be
fore Thanksgiving break.
TiberFest '97 was still a
great time although indoors.
We think everyone can agree
that it was still a blast and that
Chin Ho was great. We want
to take this time to specifically
thank all of the organizations
who helped make it all happen.
We especially want to thank the
Greek organizations who were
able to support TiberFest - Al
pha Xi Delta, Alpha Tau
Omega, FIJI, Theta Chi,
Lambda Chi Alpha, Sigma Chi,
Alph Chi Rho, Phi Sigma

Kappa, Delta Gamma, Gamma
Phi Beta, Sigma Nu, IFC,
Panhel, and of course Dean
Murphy.
This past weekend Fiji
held their third annual Run for
Leukemia to aid the Leukemia
Society of Pennsylvania. Every
year Gettysburg's Fiji chapter
teams up with Dickinson's Pi
Beta Phi sorority and runs the
game ball from Dickinson to
Gettysburg to be presented at
halftime. This year, the ball
was given to Rachel Stein, a
local girl who has been diag
nosed with Leukemia. This

year's efforts were the most
successful to date, the total
amount raised was nearly
$2,900. On behalf of of both
Fiji and Pi Beta Phi, thanks to
all who participated and helped
support the cause.
If you haven't heard
about it yet, don't forget to par
ticipate in the annual jail bail
sponsorored by TKE and Delta
Gamma. Basically the idea is
to raise money amongst friends
and place a warrant out for
someone to be arrested for the
amount of money you contrib
uted. The person who has been

placed in jail, has to bail them
selves out by raising that same
amount of money. This event
is always a lot of fun and a great
fundraiser for both of these
organizations.
Congratulations to those
recently inducted into the Or
der of Omega Honor Society.
Order of Omega is a national
Greek Honor Society, and con
tains the elite members of
Greek organizations across the
nation. The initiates were:

Conflict and Consensus

From the suggestion box

We've all been there:
it's noon on Wednesday,
you just got out of your
11:00 class, and all you
want to do is eat your lunch
and relax with your
friends. To your dismay,
however, you find that
Servo is packed with
people, all seemingly want
ing the exact same food
that you want. The
crowded space allows only
crawlspeed movement,
frustrating you even more.
To top it all off, everyone
has this 'I'm the only one
in Servo' attitude, not al
lowing any courtesy or
niceties, unaware of the
people around them, even
going so far as to stop traf
fic just to talk about last
night's ventures with a
friend. This could be a
commercial for Zantac 75.

Well, Chris Johnson
and I have come up with a
plan to help alleviate some
of the problems" we all ex
perience in Servo. Some of
the problems are due solely
to the layout of the build
ing and cannot be helped,
but at least we can make
the best of what we have
to work with.
Our first goal is to
have every first-year stu
dent go through an hour
long seminar/training

course in Servo Navigation
and Customs during orien
tation. This course would
familiarize the new stu
dents with the layout of the
food distribution area,
available seating arrange
ments, and so forth. It
would also teach the stu
dents some rules in how
one is to conduct oneself,
both in the food distribu
tion area and seating areas.
Since these rules have not
yet been established, Chris
and myself would like to

share with you some of our
ideas. 1. One-way traffic
around fhat big pillar. People
going from the entree side to
the sizzler side should go be
tween the salad bar and the pil
lar, people going from sizzler
to entree should move around
the silverware side of it. This
eliminates those awkward
bumps when two people try to
go through that tiny little space.
2. An entree line that mir
rors the Sizzler line. Follow
me, here, folks. The sizzler line
goes from left to right, so that
after people get their food, they
can immediately and easily go
to the drink area. The entree
line never forms that way, so
that people who have to get
their drinks after they get their
food have to go through the
line, increasing the risk of
dropped trays and crass com
ments. It just makes more
sense.

3. No stalling at the sil
verware distribution area. Be
lieve it or not, folks, it is pos
sible to obtain your silverware
AND look at the menu at the
same time, thereby reducing
the number of standees in front
of the troublesome pillar, help
ing traffic flow. Remember,
one-way traffic around the pil
lar, so you should go to your
left as you leave the silverware
area. However, exceptions can
be made for those who find the
entree and grill choices nause
ating. 4. No talking while in the
food distribution area. This is
a big one people. I know it will
be difficult, but if people would
simply wait until they got to
their tables to discuss the press
ing national concerns of the
day, a lot less stagnant traffic
would exist.
5. Eliminate those stupid
ice machines. This may require
the help of Servo people, but
this rule or a modification

thereof may seriously aid the
traffic flow problem. Even if we
used the ice bins, and you filled
your glasses before you got to
the drink machine, more
people would be spending less
time waiting for drinks. Be
sides, the drinks are already
cold anyway. The next rule
logically follows from the pre¬

one:
6. If there's a long line at
the drink machine closest to the
desserts, DON'T GO THERE!
How many times have you
tried to get to the entree line,
only to be blocked by a myriad
of people waiting for drinks?
Try to vary the drink machines
from which you get your
drinks, so that not everybody
is at the same machine.
Obviously, there would
have to be some kind of en
forcement for the first few
weeks that the new rules go
into effect, so perhaps someone

could volunteer to be a Servo
Nazi. ("No soup for you! You
went the wrong way around
the pole!!") Or, maybe, we
could implant electronic zap
ping devices in everyone's
heads, so that when they do
something wrong, "ZAP!", you
get "punished". Getting seri
ous, though, signage can go up
indicating traffic flow around
major obstacles, not only to
remind us of the rules, but to
aid visitors and guests, who,
although we appreciate and
understand their situation, in
variably clog up the system.

Chris and I do not claim
that these rules will solve all of
the problems, so we will wel
come any editions of these rules
or suggested new rules. We
firmly believe that educating
new students about Servo pro
cedures will help in the long
run. Sincerely, Chris Johnson
and Steve Harrell


Consider this

The new sexual assault
olicy has been presented to
lany campus groups over the
ast month with mixed reac-

10ns. The Positive Consent
J olicy clarifies many ambigu
ties 1 that marred the former
_>olicy.
For example, formerly
vhen a victim came forward
vith a charge, the burden of
>rot>f fell upon the weakened
shoulders of the victim.
The policy is simple to
mplement: talk before pro
ceeding to a higher level of
iexual intimacy. On a campus
)f supposedly well-educated

>eople where discussions are
mcouragedj • communication
hould not be an issue.
How will the policy affect
he campus? In an ideal world,
his policy would discourage all
vould-be assaulters from at
empting to. take advantage of
mother person. But in reality,
he policy would not reduce the
juber of sexual assault crimes
_iccuring on campus; at best it
vould only increase the num
>er of cases reported and hope
r ully punish any one found
milty.

Will the policy cause a
;ender division? While females
n general support the policy
vithout revision, some males

take offense to points that seem
to be directed at them. In or
der for the policy to be effec
tive in any way, everyone must
undrestand and agree on the
principles its sets forth.
While the goal of the
policy is not to dictate how
people interact, it does set up
guidelines to protect both par
ties. No longer will there be
the gray area of assumed con
sent that 'causes delays in deci
sive action.
But what is the decisive
action? There is no punish
ment, or even a range of pun
ishments, outlined for offenses.
The only way for a policy
to be effective is for its creators
to definitively state the conse
quences of one's actions.

Regardless of whether
this policy is implemented or
not, it is important for the cam
pus community to understand
that, as adults, we are all called
upon to take responsibility for
our own actions.
As a whole, when pre
sented with a situation, each
individual needs to be respon
sible enough to communicate
the acceptable bounds and be
an active participant in their
own security.
In short, no policy can do
as much as exerting your own
free will.

From The Donkey's Mouth

_College students and democrats, a perfect:t

by Libby Main
Staff Writer The Democratic Party is
more responsive than the Re
publican Party to issues that
effect college students. This
fact is evident in the policies of
the current administration,
from an historical perspective,
and even on our own college
campus.
Examples of Democratic
Party policies that address the
concerns of college students
include student loan reform,
increase in environmental pro
tection, creation of volunteer
programs, and efforts to make
voter registration easier. Presi
dent Clinton challenged Con
gress to make $10,000 of col
lege tuition tax deductible each
year and to expand work study
programs and Pell grants. He
includes passage of the Student

Loan Reform Act in his list of
accomplishments. This legisla
tion allows for flexible repay
options for college loans and
the cutting of red tape in the
loan process which saves mil
lions of taxpayer dollars. Un
fortunately, the 1996 House
Republican budget plan coun
teracted Clinton's efforts by
cutting 2.5 million students
from direct student loan pro
grams, and eliminating funding
for Perkins loans and the
Americorps program.
President Clinton has
openly expressed a concern for
leaving the environment safe
and clean for the next genera
tion. He has fought Congres
sional attempts to ease EPA re
strictions on safe food, in
creased protection of national
parks, and created a new ini
tiative called the Presidential

Forest Plan. Since 1993

match
twenty-one toxic waste sites
have been cleaned up in Penn
sylvania alone compared to
only twelve in the twelve years
previous to 1993 combined.
Hum, didn't President Bush
side with logger interests and
endanger the spotted owl?
This is of interest to college stu
dents because persons between
the ages of 18-25 are three
times as likely as their parents

to consider the environment an
important political issue.
President Clinton created
the Corporation for National
Service in 1993 which allowed
200,000 students to earn
money for college by partici
pating in formal volunteer ser
vice. The motor voter bill was
also passed in 1993. This leg
islation mandated that states
include voter registration forms
in the drivers license applica
tion and renewal process which

increased the franchise of per
son 16-25 years old.
As I stated previously, the
Democratic Party has estab
lished a precedent of looking
out for the interest of college
age persons. President
Roosevelt created the Civilian
Conservation Corps and the
Tennessee Valley Authority as
a part of his New Deal to pro
vide constructive work, food
and shelter for 18-25 year old
males during the Great Depres
sion. The G.I. Bill, which gave
countless veterans the ability to
go to college courtesy of the
federal government, was a
Democratic creation. President
Kennedy was also a proponent
of young adult involvement in
politics and he established the
Peace Corps specifically for
young adults.

The specific inclusion of
young adults in the political

process is a goal of the Demo
cratic Party as a whole. The
House Democratic Leadership
Committee specifically in
cludes information for students
on their Web page. In addition,
chapters of College Democrats
are active on college campuses
across the country.
Gettysburg's own chapter is in
the process of applying for Sen
ate re-recognition and national
affiliation. In the interim they
have participated in debates,
brought speakers to campus,
and hosted a political career
planning workshop. Persons
interested in getting involved
can come to the meetings ev
ery first and third Wednesday
of the month at 6:30p.m. in the
upstairs CUB lobby in front of
the Registrars office or contact
the current Gettysburg College
Democrats President, Andy
Zysk (he can add you to the e
mail alias).



An omn letter to President Haaland

On April 21,1997 Student Senate endorsed a letter brought to them by Students
for Ethical Action, addressed to Provost DeNicola concerning the
discriminatory policy for international students who study off campus. During
the 1995-1996 academic year, Alfonso Leon approached Student Senate about
the same issue. Because changes have still not occurred to this policy, Student
Senate endorses this letter to President Haaland.
Student Senate still feels that a revision is needed to the current policy that
disallows international students, unlike other students, from transferring their
Gettysburg College financial aid to affiliated, non-major off-campus programs.
The current policy inhibits a certain group of students, based on their national
origin, from this matchless opportunity which is often encouraged to Gettysburg
College students.
As the voice of the student body, Student Senate does not condone the current
policy. Student Senate does not want the international students of Gettysburg
College to look or feel like diversity tokens. Please reevaluate this policy with a
humane outlook. Also, please remember that the first page of the College's
1997-1998 handbook states, "It is the policy of Gettysburg College not to
discriminate improperly any matriculated student... on account of... national
origin..." Senate looks forward to hearing directly from you in a short time.

To the Editor:

Casey is gone. Her life
has been celebrated in
many wonderful ways this
past ten days. However we
should not forget all those
who went before her; those
students who died in auto
mobile and other accidents,
untimely losses like the
Biser boys, and faculty, stu
dents, staff and administra
tors who have died from
terminal illnesses or by
their own hand. Also on
Veterans or Armistice Day,
we cannot forget our Vets
who fought for us and
some of whom gave their
lives and did not return.
What about all the

other folks we know, fam
ily and friends, who suffer.
Shouldn't we celebrate
Casey's life by reaching out
to these folks before it is
too late? For many of us
Thanksgiving Break pro
vides our first big opportu
nity. Thanks 'Burgian staff
for a great last issue and to
all those who helped us
deal with our grief and
pain. Casey I know would
be proud of you as you gave
selflessly.

The Pachyderm's Pulpit

Coming soon, a primary that means something

by John Dunlap
Staff Writer Last week the Gettysburg
College Republicans heard
form Charles Gerow_, who is a
republican candidate for Con
gress right here in the nine
teenth congressional district of
Pennsylvania. What is interest
ing about Mr. Gerow's candi
dacy is that this district already
has a republican congressman,
Bill Goodling. In the last elec
toral cycle, Mr. Gerow chal
lenged Congressman Goodling
and received a surprisingly
good 45 percent of the vote.
Now Charlie Gerow is back
and Bill Goodling is worried.
Today a battle is raging
inside both political parties
over their individual identities.

In the Democratic Party, as
President Bill Clinton attempts
to make his party become more
moderate he finds 80 percent
of the Democrats in Congress
abandoning him on trade and
siding with the left-wing labor
unions. In the GOP, New Jer
sey Governor Christine Todd
Whitman was almost defeated
earlier this month because 7
percent of the electorate who
was pro-life abandoned the
Governor for third-party can
didates because of her ardent
pro-choice stance. The ideo
logues in both parties are still
driving the parties and while
sometimes they may hurt in a
general election, they can not
be forgotten because they are
the foot soldiers in both major
political parties. Here in south
central Pennsylvania a battle is
will occur next spring over
what direction willhardcore

Republicans follow, a more stri
dent conservative approach or
the more moderate to conser
vative approach.
This primary will for all
intents and purposes decide
who will represent York,
Adams, and Cumberland
Counties in the United States
House of Representatives. Re
publicans have an almost two
to one registration edge and
Goodling won last year with
63% of the vote against his
Democrat challenger, Scott
Chronister. The last time this
district sent a democrat to
Washington was in 1964 when
Congressman George
Goodling, the father of the cur
rent incumbent, was defeated
in the Lyndon Johnson land
slide. Two years later George
Goodling took the seat back
and since then only he and his
son have held it. When George
Goodling retired in 1974, his
son, Bill, succeeded him.

Before Bill Goodling
came to Congress his life was
that of an educator. He was a
teacher, coach, and administra
tor. Eventually, he became a
York County School Superin
tendent. Goodling's life has
been teaching and in the Con
gress education issues are his
main areas of interest.
For years the congress
man was part of the Republi
can minority in the House. He
and his colleague's main duty
was defending Republican
Presidents of the United States
and fighting the Democrat ma
jority. Year after year, York,
Hanover, and Gettysburg sent
Bill Goodling back to Congress

with no trouble at all. In 1992,
however, Congressman
Goodling hit trouble when he
was part of the House check
bouncing scandal. He was still
reelected in a competitive
three-party race with 47per
cent of the vote. In 1994, the
role that Bill Goodling played
in Congress changed as the re
publican party won control of
Congress for the first time in
40 years. Goodling who ran
unopposed in '94 became the
Chairmen of the House Com
mittee on Education and Work
place. Goodling was part of the
republican team led by House
Speaker Newt Gingrich that
enacting the most comprehen
sive domestic reforms since the
1960_'s.

This year it was Bill
Goodling who received na
tional attention for his battle
with President Clinton over the
Administration's national stan
dardized testing plan. Last
week an agreement was
reached with the President to
hold off any testing for now.
Goodling, has had to defend
the Republican education and
labor agenda which have meant
that the liberal unions have hit
him hard.
For almost three years
chairman Goodling has stood
resolute. He is one of many Re
publicans who over the years
have moved to the right,with
the country and both major po
litical parties. Goodling under
went what I call the Reagan
change. In 1980, Bill Goodling
chaired George Bush's presi
dential campaign in Pennsylva
nia, but as we all know Ronald

Reagan swept the country that
year. Ronald Reagan moved
the whole country right, and he
went from being called extreme
to defining what was main
stream. Goodling was not
alone, three of Reagan's pri
mary opponents in 1980
moved rightward and to this
day sing the 40th President of
the United States praises,
George Bush, Bob Dole, and
Howard Baker.
On certain issues, Bill
Goodling stands alone among
most republicans. On educa
tion while he has lead the fight
against President Clinton's na
tional education agenda, he at

the same time believes there
should be a very limited federal
role in education. That is why
he opposes the abolishment of
the Federal Department of
Education. Other republicans,
such as Jim Gilmore who last
week was elected Governor of
Virginia are now adopting
Goodling's approach. Gilmore
instead of talking about cuts
talked about reforms and he
won resoundingly. Goodling
also differs with most of the
GOP on the death penalty. He
opposes the death penalty out
of conscience, which is an is
sue I respect him on since I
agree with him.

On most other issues, Bill
Goodling is your standard re
publican. He supports tax cuts,
reducing the size and scope of
the government, and is pro-life
on abortion. However, it is
that handful of issues along
with his 24 years in Congress
that Charlie Gerow is blasting
him on.

This race is close to home
since Charlie Gerow today is
teaching here in the Manage
ment Department. Some of his
fellow professors have raised
eyebrows over a candidate for
Congress being hired just as he
begins his campaign. Beyond
teaching, Gerow heads the
Pennsylvania Citizens Against
Government Waste. Charlie
Gerow is an articulate, commit
ted conservative and I respect
him for that. The College Re
publicans have met both and I
have come to spend a lot of
time with Chairmen Goodling.
He has spoken before our
campus's Student Senate and
has hosted the College Repub¬

licans in Washington. I have
come to like and respect him.
If Bill Goodling is un
seated in the primary than that
is a defeat for House Speaker
Gingrich and congressional re
publicans. The GOP will be
pushed even further right and
while I have not been happy
with republicans this year in
their failure take on the Presi
dent, I do understand that the
GOP must work to bring Bill
Clinton closer to our side if we
want to accomplish anything.
What Republicans do not need
now is an internal battle that
distracts from their agenda of
cutting taxes, balancing the
budget, and enacting common
sense education reforms. Since

a primary battle will occur all
around us then I look forward
to following it and, hopefully,
participating in it.

Cross country team keeps on trucking....

by Peter Huminski
Staff Writer The heavy rains and
hilly course could not slow
down the Gettysburg College
cross country teams at the Cen
tennial Conference champion
ships on Saturday at Ursinus
College. The men's team had a
strong showing,they finished in
third place with 70 points.
Haverford won the team title
for the sixth consecutive time
scoring 22 points. F & M fin
ished second with 58 points.
Leading the Bullets
was junior Kris Weum who fin
ished sixth in a time of 28:56.
Weum's finish earned him first
team all-conference honors.
"It was an outstanding
meet for Weum," said Bullets
coach Robert Condon. "They
did a great job as a team. I
don't see how they could have
done anymore on that day."

The Bullet men also
had two other runners earn
honors on Saturday. Seniors Ja
son Smith and James Smith
earned all-conference second
team honors. Jason Smith fin
ished ninth in a time of 29:05,
while James Smith finished
number 13 in a time of 29:26.
Rounding out the Bul
lets top seven were Brendon
Clark (16, 29:32), Jon Catlett
(27 30:01), Dave Gary (29,
30:12), and Brian Rusignuolo
(37, 30:41).

"Jon gave a great ef
fort, despite coming off of an
injury," said Condon. "Brian
(Rusignuolo) has been making
steady progress and improve
ment, which is what he needs
to do. He has been pushing
harder in the workouts and he
may have been a little tired on
the hilly course."
Without their top two
runners because of the GRE's
the Bullet women were not able
to fair as well as the men fin
ishing in eighth place with 194
points. Dickinson won the
women's team title with 32
points. Leading the Bullet
women was senior Joyce
O'Neil. O'Neil finished 18 in
a time of 20:31.

"I was pleased with
Joyce," said Condon. "She re
ally ran well. She was up in the
top five for most of the race,
and then I think that the hills
caught up to her at the end.
That it was a nice solid effort,
she didn't sit back and play it
safe. Come regionals I think
she will be able to hang in there
and finish high up there."
The Bullets next fin
isher was Karen Helmick who
finished the tough 3.1 mile
course in Hunsberger Woods in
a time of 20:59. Her time was
good enough for placing.
Rounding out the rest
of the women's top finishers
were Kristin Mills (45, 21:55),
Kelley Lord (48, 22:01), Tracy

Swackhammer (53, 22:10),
Kim Heimerl (54, 22:11), and
Jen Wise (55, 22:16).
"We had a couple of
women sick,"said Condon.
"Kim Heimerl was really sick
on Monday. She had a sub-par
performance because of it.
When you are sick, and run
ning in the rain, and on a hilly
course it takes a lot out of your
performance."
The Bullets next race
is on November 15, when they
head up to Dickinson to com
pete in the NCAA East Re-

pnoto Dy MarkAstrom
All-World volleyball player Cat Schott (15) says, "Not in my house," to the opposing spike.

gional meet. In the guys race,
the top two teams qualify for
Nationals which will be held in
Boston. For the women, the
top four teams qualify.
Condon is optimistic
about his teams chances at the
meet. "We are looking forward
to the regional because we
know we have some room to
move," said Condon about the
guys team. "One of our goals
is to beat F&M. If we do that,
we should be in the running to
beat Carnegie Mellon, the team

right ahead of them. I think
we will be one of the top four
teams in the region."
In the girls race,
Condon is looking forward to
getting Wendy Johnston and
Martie Callelo back. "When we
get our top two runners back,
I think we will finish in the top
10 teams," said Condon. "I
also think that if we keep run
ning like we are, we could have
a couple of runners qualify in
dividually for nationals if we
don't qualify as a team."

As college basketball season begins, we reflect on the
Loss of a legend

by Peter Huminski
Staff Writer October 9, 1997 marked
the end of an era in college bas
ketball. This is the day that
Dean Edward Smith retired as
head basketball coach from the
University of North Carolina.
There is only one word to
describe Dean Smith: class. For
36 years he graced the sidelines
as coach in North Carolina. He
won 879, games more than any
other coach in college basket
ball history. He lead North
Carolina to two National
Championships, 11 Final Four
appearances, and 33 consecu
tive top three finishes in the
ACC (the Atlantic Coast Con
ference, the premier confer
ence in college basketball).
These statistics are amaz
ing, but the thing that is even
more amazing is that he did it
without ever having an NCAA
violation claim against him.

To his players Smith was
more than a coach, he was a
father figure and a mentor.
"He's a father figure to a lot of
players and a lot of people,"
said Michael Jordan. "That's
how he's always been, very
genuine in his attitude toward
the players."
Jordan became the star
player we all know today
thanks in part to Smith's tute
lage. Jordan led the Tar Heels
to their first NCAA title under
Smith in 1982. Jordan, then a
freshman, hit the game winning
shot to beat the Georgetown
Hoyas. Jordan came back to
Chapel Hill and won NCAA
player of the year for 1983 and
1984. Showing his unselfish
love for his players Smith ad
vised Jordan to leave school

after his junior year. He
thought that my skill level was
ready for the pros," said Jor
dan. "He felt I needed a big
ger challenge and advised me
to go."
Smith set up a scholarship
fund for his former players who
left UNC early to pursue a ca¬

reer in basketball. He knew the
true value of a college educa
tion. In his retirement press
conference, Smith said that it
is sad that the school did not
make this big a deal over a
Nobel laureate retiring.
Coach Smith had to be
convinced to return to Carolina
last season, becatise he was al
most embarrassed about break
ing the legendary Adolph
Rupp's record of 876 career
coaching victories.
In a show of his unself
ishness and his respect for the
game, Smith did not want to
break the record. People close
to Smith convinced him that his
success was the wrong reason
to leave the game, so Smith re
turned. On March 15, 1997, m
the Tar Heels defeated The
Fairfield Stags in the first round
of the NCAA tournament to
give coach Smith victory num
ber 877.

Tar Heel fans need not
worry about falling from the
top of the college basketball
world just yet. Smith has
handed over the coaching
reigns to his long time assistant
Bill Guthridge. "He
(Guthridge) has learned well
from the master and he is ready
and eager to do the job," said
UNC athletic director Dick
Baddour.
Guthridge, who was
Smith's assistant for 30 years at
UNC, has a lot of talented play
ers returning. Guthridge has
the support of the players so
UNC should be up to its old
winning ways down on To
bacco Road.
"It's like you're losing
your father, but he's being re
placed with your uncle," said
Tar Heels center Antawn
Jamison.

"He's not as soft-spoken
as he looks," said Ademola
Okulaja. "He's very active, es
pecially at practice, and he's got
everyone's respect because of
his knowledge of the game."
Guthridge was Smith's
first choice as his successor, and

Smith made sure his long time
assistant was rewarded with a
long term contract.
Guthridge's hiring epitomizes
Smith's loyalty and unselfish

Sophomore scoring standout JasonVishio attempts to cross up a would-be defender.

class. "Coach Guthridge is one
of the great coaches," said
Smith. "He's turned down
head coaching jobs before, and
now he's got one."

Smith will always be
missed not because of his ac
complishments on the court
but for his respect, loyalty, and
friendship off it.

nation. This victory pretty
much assures the Bullets a bid
to the national tournament.
The first half of play was
muddy and both teams needed
to control their ball posses
sions. Where the F&M squad
fell short the Bullets were re
lentless. The Bullets recorded
17 shots in the first half and
broke out to a 4-0 lead. Greg
Stevcic scored two goals, his
second being off an impressive
corner kick. Chris Pryor also
scored two goals in the first
half. Both Chris Pryor and

This win adds to the Bul

The second half of play
was equally impressive for the
Bullets. As the Bullets began
to substitute fresh legs into the
game, such as John Malcom
and Brian Fisher. With the help
of these guys the Bullets scored
another three goals to jump out
to a 7-0 lead.
These goals were scored
by Brian Hill, Jason Vishio, and
Chris Pryor. The Gettysburg
defense again was led by the
play and example of Jim Green
and Matt Kelly. Jon Katerba
recorded his fourth shut out in
a row. The game ended with a
very _rAuch astonished F&M
squad and a victorious Gettys

"GOLDEN GRAHAM"

by Ben Wolf
Contributing Writer/ B.A.S.S
member Name: Mike Graham
Age: 20
Sport: Football
Major: History
Minor: Education
Year: Junior
Hobbies/Interests: Sports
& Movies Mike Graham is a jun
ior transfer student playing
middle linebacker for the Bul
lets football team this season.
What is different about Mike
is that he happens to also be
born and raised here in the
Gettysburg community. So,
this semester is a new beginning
in familiar settings for the Get
tysburg defenseman.

Mike began his ath
letic and academic career at
Gettysburg Area High School.
There, he played both football
and basketball, and was the
team captain of each team as
well. While at Gettysburg
High, due to his personality
and his ability to work well
with others, Mike was advised
to pursue a career in education.
(Even though, his original hope
was to attend film school, due
to his fondness of movies.)
During this time in his
childhood and young adult
hood, Mike had the opportu
nity to play with and become
friends of one Brandon
Streeter. Mike can still recall
meeting Brandon's father,
Coach Barry Streeter of the
Gettysburg Bullets football
team, around sixth or seventh

grade. This relationship with
Coach Streeter would end up
helping Mike in the future.
After finishing high
school, Mike looked at several
colleges, including Gettysburg
College, but chose
Susquehanna University. Mike
based his whole coHege deci
sion on the best financial aid
package that he received. That
decision would eventually
come back to haunt him in the
future. After two years of
school and football in
Susquehanna, Mike decided
that he needed a change. He
described it as, " ...the situation
just didn't feel right. After two

nences at Gettysburg College
are much better than those at
Susquehanna.
When comparing the
schools, he believes that the
college community is much
more personable, the campus is
kept up better, and the academ
ics are more challenging.
Mike is also enjoying his
football career a lot more . In
contrasting his two college
football teams, he feels the Bul
lets are closer and more orga
nized than his old Susquehanna
squad. Mike also favors the

Gettysburg football program's
dedication to guide its players
athletically and academically.
Mike Graham has seen
his college move as, " A new
beginning for me." This view
happens to also be the reason
why Mike now sports a shaved
head for new college experi
ence in Gettysburg. As for his
plans for the future, Mike
could actually see himself liv
ing and teaching in Gettysburg.
(Even though he insists, "I am
not afraid to go anywhere
else!")

years, I felt as though I had to
do something else."
As Mike began exploring
his options, Gettysburg College
became his clear choice. In ad
dition to it being not so foreign
to him, he already had personal
relationships with some of the
faculty, including Coach
Streeter. Mike had no problem
going to college close to his
home, because he feels, "A
myth about college is that
people believe 'the further
away, the better'; but in all ac
tuality, fifteen minutes away
could be like going to college
in another state."
So far, Mike's new expe-

Mike says he has matured
a lot since his earlier days in
Gettysburg, and hopes that
Gettysburg College will con
tinue to make his transfer de
cision worthwhile.

WHERE IT'S AT...

With all of her talent, and skills to hoot, this BECK(y) is anything but a loser.

Field hockey has been a
way of life for senior Becky
Griffith for as long as she can
remember. AH through el
ementary school Becky went to
field hockey games with her
mom, Kris, who was a field
hockey player in high school.
Even Becky's baby-sitter played
field hockey. When Griffith
was finally old enough to join
her own team it seemed the
natural thing to do.
Griffith began her field
hockey career in the seventh
grade. "I played on the fresh
man team," Becky said, "they
put all the seventh and eighth
graders on that team." Being a
part of a team was not new to
Griffith, who had been playing
soccer since third grade.

By Chesha Miller
Staff Writer

Becky continued to play
soccer in the spring and field
hockey in the fall through out
her four years at Cedar Cliff
High School in Camp Hill,
Pennsylvania. In addition to
playing field hockey and soc
cer, Griffith was a gymnast for
ten years.
In high school, Becky
longed to play forward, but
since so many others also
wanted to play that position,
she stepped back. "I played
link," she explained, "it is just
like midfield- [the position] I
played in soccer." In 1994,
when Becky came to Gettys
burg ,she was finally able to live
out her dream and play for
ward. Griffith followed her

mother to her alma mater, Get
tysburg, but insists it was not a
family tradition. "I didn't even
want to go to Gettysburg," said
Becky, "but, when I came to see
the campus, took a tour and
meet coach- I loved it."
Becky has had quite an
impressive field hockey career
in Gettysburg. She was a
starter for all four years and
started and played in every
game since her freshman year.
As a junior, Becky broke the

record for most assists in a sea
son (15), along with the record
for most assists in a career (25).
As a forward who con
stantly scored, Becky broke the
record for most goals in a sea
son (14) her senior year, and
was just shy of attaining the
record for most goals in a ca
reer. Griffith scored 39 goals
in her career, four goals short
of the record 43.
Becky, a "scoring ma
chine", as Gettysburg field
hockey coach Carol Daly calls
her, has also won a number of
honors for her excellent play
ing. Griffith was named as a
first-team Centennial Confer
ence All-Star as a sophomore
and junior, and will probably
receive the same honor this sea
son as a senior (the teams have
not yet been chosen).

Despite all of her awards and accomplishments, Becky Griffith is a big fan of humble pie.

As a sophomore, Becky
was selected as a Regional Ail
American, and her junior year
she was named a National All
American, an honor she will
most likely repeat this year.
This week Becky learned
that she made the North/South
Division III All-Star Game. She
will play at the University of

Connecticut on November 21st
in connection with the Division
I National Championships. In
addition to this huge honor,
Coach Daly nominated Becky
for the Centennial Conference
Player of the Year, a nomina
tion which is in itself a great
accolade.
A two-year team captain,
Becky displays her leadership
skills both on and off the field.
"Becky demonstrates her lead
ership through her playing and
[her] work ethic," explained
Coach Daly. "It is hard to dif
ferentiate between a game and
practice with Becky."
"In practice I always want
to do my best," explained
Griffith. "I try to impress my
coaches so that they know that
I am always trying."
Coaching Becky has been
a delight for Coach Daly. "It is
a pleasure to coach a kid with
a game face on every moment,"
said Daly.

We have been very lor
tunate to have her, she has been
a large help to the success of
our team." Becky was always a
large threat to any opponent.
For Gettysburg field hockey,
Becky played many key roles.

"She was a rusher on de
fensive corners and a hitter-out
on offensive corners," ex
plained Coach Daly, "[she also]
often took the penalty stroke."
Becky's athletic
ability_.though great is not her
most memorable trait. Her
sportsmanship and humble na
ture stand out most. "She is a
very high caliber athlete," com
mented Coach Daly. "Becky is
one of the finest hockey play
ers to go through our program
and she handles it all very hum
bly. [She] is very unassuming."
"We focus on one game at
a time and that got us where
we want to be," said Griffith,
talking about the field hockey
team making the ECAC tour
nament this past weekend.

Griffith was very excited
with the opportunity to play in
the post season playoffs. Go
ing into the game she had the
chance to break the record for
most goals in a career, but as is
her nature Griffith was not
worried about that.
"Getting the goal record
is not something I would like
to focus on," she said, "I don't
want to put that kind of pres
sure on myself." Becky would

rather focus on the close knit
friendships formed on the play
ing field.
When she came to Get
tysburg, as a freshman, the field
hockey team was much closer
than her team had been in high
school. "I really looked up to
all the seniors my freshman
year," she said, "we still talk
about that season."
Becky was impressed
with the mutual respect on the
team and how the upperclass
men took the time to teach re
spect to the freshmen. "Now I

really enjoy teaching that [re
spect] to the underclass,"
Griffith noted. This season
Becky was especially excited
that Kristen Stuckel joined
Gettysburg's field hockey
coaching staff. Stuckel was a
senior on Gettysburg's team
when Griffith was a freshman.
Becky works very hard in
all aspects of her life. A health
and exercise science major,
Griffith puts a lot of time and
hard work into her academic
work. "I try as hard as I can
and take school very seriously,"
she said, "I have to work hard
for my grades."

In addition to her great
role on the field hockey team,
Becky finds time to be a mem
ber of Chi Omega, and to be a
part of the Senior Scholarship
Committee. Griffith is also em
ployed by Campus Recreation
where she works at the infor
mation desk, in the weight
room and does the statistics for
the men's basketball games.
"[Becky] is a true sports
man, I don't want her to gradu
ate," said Coach Daly fondly.
Becky will miss playing field
hockey just as her coaches and
teammates will miss playing
with her.
"It's hard to believe it's
almost over, some of my best
memories come from playing
on this team," said Becky. As
Becky goes into the North/
South Division III All-Star
Game and then out into the
"real world" those memories
will keep her happy.

Football cursed by Red Devils, burn 35-14

by Chris Lunardi
Contributing Writer
In a game that was built
up as a battle for pride, the
Gettysburg Bullets football
team lost to Dickinson, their
long time rivals from Carlisle.
Coming into the game, neither
team had a chance to win the
Centennial Conference as Get
tysburg and Dickinson had
records of 4-5 and 3-6, respec
tively. This traditional game is
about much more that records
or conference championships,
however, and both teams knew
the game would be a war.

Neither team scored on
an opening drive, but
Dickinson was the first to crack
the Scoreboard with a touch
down midway through the first
quarter. The two teams went
back and forth for much of the
second half, until Dickinson
threatened to score with time
running down in the half. With
only a few minutes to go, a Red
Devil receiver made a fingertip
catch in the corner of the
endzone to give the visitors a
two touchdown lead going into
halftime.
The Gettysburg offense

took the ball to start the sec
ond half, but put a bullet in its
own foot by turning the ball
over to the Devils. Dickinson
went on to score and take a 21
0 lead early in the second half.
From then on the two teams
battled, trading hard hit for
hard hit all through the rest of
the game. The Bullet offense
began clicking and the result
was a Paul Smith touchdown to
cut the lead to 14. The other
Buiiet touchdown came at the
end of a long drive in which
Smith carried the load, and
many Red Devil defenders, to
move the ball down the field.
Matt Helwig capped the drive
by getting into endzone on a
handoff from the QB Dennis
Flaherty.

Despite the Bullets best
efforts, the final score was
Dickinson 35, Gettysburg 14.
Although it was a disappoint
ing loss, there were some sil
ver linings on this cloudy day.
Seniors Kevin Gurski, Joe
Hodakoski and Junior Jason
Osborn had big days on de
fense, and there were some
outstanding performances
turned in on the offensive side

of the ball. Junior Jeff Closz
had ten catches for 137 yards,
and came up with many crucial
first down catches. Sophomore
Paul Smith continued his great
season by breaking 1000 rush
ing yards and 2000 all-purpose
yards with a 35 yard romp
through the Dickinson defense.
The most impressive statistic
about Smith this season is that
he currently leads the nation,
yes, the nation, in Division III
ail-purpose-yards.
These individual perfor
mances do not take the sting
away from this loss for the Bul
lets. The unfortunate thing
about football is that you only
get one chance to play a team
each year. This means that the
Bullets will have to wait an
other year to avenge this loss.
The great thing about football
is that you always get to come
back and play again next week
(well, not after this week, but
almost always). The team has
now turned its attention to this

weeks game with Franklin and
Marshall. F & M is
Gettysburg's oldest rivalry, and
also one of its most bitter. De
spite the ups and downs that

this team has gone through this
year, there is no question that
a win in Lancaster this week
will make this season for the
Bullets. In case you needed a
reason to come see the game
on Saturday, it will be the last

Freshman rocket-arm QB Dennis Flaherty looks downfield
for some running room. p_^to by Mark Astrom

time that this class of seniors
will lead the Bullets onto the
field. This writer will certainly
have a front row seat for the
game, and I would also like to
thank all the seniors for all they
have done. We'll miss you.


SENIORS SAY GOODBYE

Josh Eyler
Assistant Sports Editor
Good-bye. It is a word
that we have all said so many
times in our lives that we no
longer think about what it re
ally means. In fact we say it
everyday in some form or an
other. We've all said good-bye
to friends, family,
acquaintances,and people we
knew that we would never see
again. Most of the time it is easy
to say, other times it is not. The
Senior Bullets who have partici
pated on Fall Sports Teams are
arriving at one of the more dif
ficult times not as the season is
almost finished.
But how do you say
good-bye to something that

you have put so much time in
through the years. Something
that you've trained for day in
and day out. Something that
you've practiced since you
could remember. Something
that has made you rejoice in
victory and cry in defeat.
Something that has been
a part of you for so long that it
almost defines the person that
you are. It is not easy.
The time has passed that
these men and women will
wear the Bullet orange and blue
to score a goal, throw a touch
down, run a race, or spike a
volleyball.
So many different seniors
that I asked said much of the
same things when asked about
their time here at Gettysburg.
Many said that they would miss
the friends that they had made,

the closeness of the teams, the
wins. Some said that their re
spective sports had taught them
a lot about life, even the blow
out losses. I think that Rob
Sena, senior captain and defen
sive back of the football team,
expresses these sentiments the
best, though: "I don't know
what I'm going to do now that
I don't have it (football) to train
for. I've loved it, it has meant
the world to me, and nothing,
I don't think, will ever compare
to it." On behalf of all the se
niors, from the stars to the un
sung heroes, for whom this ar
ticle was written...
Good-bye.
"I do not fear tomorrow
because I have seen yesterday
and I love today."

Honor Commission elections, today and tomorrow

By Daniel Larkm
News Editor

December 1-5, Center for
Public Service will sponsor AIDS
Awareness Week at Gettysburg
College.
In conjunction with World
AIDS Day, celebrated globally on
Monday, December 1, the Center
for Public Service (CPS) will spon
sor a series of events aimed at in
creasing campus awareness of the
HIV and AIDS viruses.
The programming will begin
with an opening chapel service held
at noon on Monday.
Throughout the day on Mon
day, a candlevigil will be held in
the chapel. Members of the cam
pus community are encouraged to
come in throughout the day and
light a candle for people in their
lives touched by AIDS.
Tuesday will feature a pre
sentation titled "A Positive Life,"
presented by River Houston. Hous
ton will discuss what it is like to

live with the HIV virus, and how it
has changed her perspective of life.
She will address issues of discrimi
nation and stereotyping, as well as
we fight for her rights as a woman
with HIV and her sex-positive atti
tude. Houston will speak in the
Chapel at 8 p.m.
Wednesday will feature "A
Day without Art." In a program
sponsored by Allies and the AIDS
Awareness Week committee, works
of art around campus will be cov
ered from view. This is done to re
mind the community of the large
number of artists whose lives have
been lost to AIDS.
Also on Wednesday, the
'Women's Center will hold a lunch

time program, on the issue of
Women and HIV.
Thursday, as part of the
Common Hour lecture series, the
Center for Public Service will
sponsor photographer Carolyn
Jones. Author and photographer
of Courage in the Face of AIDS,
Jones will present a slide show
capturing people of all back
grounds who are living with HIV
and AIDS.
Her slide presentation will
illustrate the self confidence and
wisdom of ordinary people coping
with an extraordinary fate, facing
their mortality, questioning their
priorities, and living life to the full
est. The face and stories of these
people aim to show that AIDS
"doesn't look like anyone - it looks
like and ultimately is all of us."
Kim Westermann of the
CPS, who is coordinating the
week's events, said that "AIDS is
something that everybody knows
about, but we've stopped talking
about."

Olmos challenges Convocation audience

by Rebecca M. Schantzenbach
Staff Writer Fall Convocation, as Presi
dent Haaland says, "a time to lis
ten, learn, and be challenged."
The campus community gathered
together last Thursday, Novem
ber 13, at 11:30 a.m. to hear Ed
ward James Olmos speak.
Olmos' topic was "We're
All in the Same Gang." He ad
dressed the importance of lan
guage, community, and diversity.
According to Olmos, part of what
makes our country so wonderful
is that we have such a wide vari
ety of nationalities and languages
living with us.
Olmos' style of speaking
was both energetic and
unorthadox. Rahter than a

diadactic lecture, he conveyed his
message through andecdotes.
"Language and communi
cation are one of the greatest gifts
we have," said Olmos. He
stressed the importance of learn
ing to speak different languages
to keep up with the world.
To Olmos, English-only is
one of the biggest mistakes we
can make. It will only serve to
hinder the upcoming generations
-it will be giving them an oppor
tunity to skip out on learning for
eign languages.
"Culture makes America
great!" Olmos said. He believes
that we must not only talk about
diversity, but teach it as well. As
far as he is concerned, we will
never become a melting pot;
"we're a salad for the duration."

"The lettuce will always be
lettuce, the tomatoes will always
be tomatoes. They can't change
their identity, but when you mix
them together, it makes some
thing delicious! Part of being
human is the fact that we all be
long together." Olmos said.
Olmos spoke of the differ
ence between what he called the
"wise selfish person" and the
"foolish selfish person."
The foolish selfish person
he described as one who "goes to
work, comes home, say their
prayers, and go to bed."
The wise selfish man, he
defined as one who does the same
thing, but "before they go to bed,
they open their door and make
sure that their neighbors are
okay."

Olmos said that when he
woke up Wednesday moring "I
looked across the street to see
if Getttysburg was okay."
Olmos noted that he was
probably the first Convocation
speaker of latin descent to
speak at Gettysburg.
Olmos feels that ulti
mately, if we can become more
understanding of the people,
if we can learn about other
views and beliefs, we will be
able to create better commu
nities and living environments.
We must prepare for the
future, both ours, our
children's, and our children's
children.
Creating a safer, more
open, and diverse society will
give us exactly what we need.

quire spring tuition payments be
fore Christmas, and students at
some institutions cannot pre-reg

for the spring semester.
This is creating a dilemma

for students, who could be forced
to make an unpleasant choice: do
they pay tuition on time and lose
out on the scholarship money, or
register late and miss out on early

Other programs for AIDS
Awareness Week include the
showing of the films "And the
Band Played On," on Monday
and "Philadelphia" on Wednes
day in the Junction, and programs
in Residence Halls designed to
raise AIDS awareness.
Westermann said that she
was very pleased with the cam
pus response to the program
ming. "We had a lot of organiza
tions involved in the volunteer ef
forts," she said.
Westermann said that
AIDS is an important issue that
the campus needs to address.
"We need to do everything we
can to keep it in the forefront,"
she said.




HOPE- from page

access to courses?
The issue also poses a
problem for colleges, who risk
cashflow, paperwork and admin
istrative problems if they actively
urge students to delay payments.
However, the alternative is
for institutions to withhold the
information and, perhaps, alien
ate their students.
"They realize it could be a
huge public relations nightmare
if they don't disclose the infor
mation," said Noah Brown of the
Association of Community Col
lege Trustees, based in Washing
ton. Under the HOPE Scholar
ship, students can receive a tax
credit of up to $1,500 annually
for the freshmen and sophomore
years of college. The program's
main target is middle-income
families, and two -parent house
holds are eligible if they earn up
to $100,000 a year. Single-par
ent families are eligible if they
earn no more than $50,000 annu
ally. And despite this fall's
flurry of activity, students and
their families will not reap any
benefits until they file tax returns.
While payments after January 1
qualify for the scholarship, fami
lies will not receive the credits
until they file their 1998 returns
— which are not due until April
1999. Because HOPE targets the
first two years of college, stu
dents now in their sophomore
years are most at risk of losing
benefits if they pay before Janu¬

ary 1. The 1998 spring is the only
time they will qualify for HOPE,
since most students will become
juniors by the fall 1998 semes
ter. An informal survey by the
National Association of College
and University Business Officers
(NACUBO) found that about half
of colleges and universities have
due dates for spring tuition pay
ments before January 1, said
Mary Bachinger, program man
ager in the association's public
policy department.
Colleges with early pay¬

ment dates face a difficult finan
cial decision, she said.
The issue poses adminis
trative problems as _welK For ex
ample, a college that allows stu
dents to pre-register now and pay
in January must change its regis
tration process. Otherwise, com
puter systems may "kick out" stu
dents if they show no record of
payment by a certain date, she
said. Another topic on the minds
of many college administrators is
how—or whether—they should
inform students and their fami
lies about the problem.
"There are a number of
schools who have taken a hard
line against disclosures, but 1
think they're in the minority,"
said Larry Zaglaniczy, associate
director of the National Associa
tion of Student Financial Aid
Administrators in Washington.
While Some institutions
may do nothing to inform stu
dents, others have sent letter to
parents, and some amy waive late
fees, he said.
In Florida, one college is
encouraging students to pay tu
ition early but does not plan to
file these paymetns until after
January 1.
Daytona Beach Commu
nity College will escrow the
spring semester tuition money,
leaving it in reserve until the new
law takes effect.
"When students register,
we strongly recommend that they
pay and lock in their schedules,"
said Philip Day, the college presi
dent. So far, colleges and univer
sities have learned HOPE will
require some major
recordkeeping changes. For ex
ample, schools eventually will
need to send names and Social
Security numbers to treasury so
the federal agency can monitor
the program, Bachiner said.

Ultimately, however, it is
students -or their family tax ad
visers- who will need to assess
their eligibility for the HOPE pro
gram. "That's something col
leges won't be able to do,"
Zaglaniczny said.

Student Senate Highlights
Nov. 17.1997

by Laura Root
Staff writer The Student Senate held
its most recent meeting last
Monday, November 17, at 7.00
p.m. in CUB 260.
First on the agenda was
voting on recognizing the
Gettysburg College
Democrats. Andrew
Zysk, the president of the club,
gave a brief presentation on his
organization.
The majority of the Stu
dent Senate then voted to rec
ognize the College Democrats.

This means that the Democrats
will be recognized next year by
Gettysburg College and receive a
budget.
The probationary status of
the Freehealth Society was also
passed. This is a club whose pur
pose would be to cater to the
needs of students who are pursu
ing health-related careers.
The Senate then discussed
the results of the student survey
that it had
distributed. Those who
filled out the surveys were mainly
concerned ahout social activities.

Students expressed a de
sire for more non-Greek activi
ties on campus over the week
ends. Among the suggestions
were moie free bands and
dorm competitions. Academic
concerns were mainly centered
around the need for more vol
umes in the library on special
ized fields.
Next Monday, there will
be a student forum that will
address the problem
of alcohol abuse. All
students are welcome to at
tend.

Mmm ... _T\irkey

by Cara Masucci
Staff Writer There is an old saying
about Thanksgiving dinner: it
takes all morning to cook, and
you're done eating it within
twenty minutes. While this
holds true for your typical fam
ily get-together, it doesn't for
the Thanksgiving dinner served
here at the dining hall on Tues
day night. That meal took al
most a month to prepare.
The dining service was
not cooking a month ago, but
believe it or not, they were
working out arrangements for
Tuesday night's feast that long
ago. During October, the din
ing service was busy ordering
the one hundred and eighty
turkeys that it would serve for
the annual Thanksgiving din
ner.

At nine thirty Tuesday
morning, before many college
students are even up, dining
hall workers were busy starting
to roast the turkeys. Accord
ing to Gary Brautigam of the
dining services, what goes un
known to the students is the
amount of time it takes to pre
pare the meal, in addition to
the other two meals of the day.
Still, the faculty does the
dinner because "they are so
geared [up] by the students."
He also went on to say the din
ner is well received by the stu
dents themselves.
This became apparent
when anybody tried to get into
the dining center on Tuesday
night. Students waited for as
long as twenty to thirty min
utes to get into the dining cen
ter. Still, everyone decided to
bear the line for the meal.

Many upperclass students
had been looking forward to
this meal for weeks, remember
ing past years of enjoyment.
Those upperclassmen who had
missed the meal in past years
were psyched for that first time.
First year students were
also greatly anticipating this
meal. Having heard about it

from their upperclass friends
for months, the big night had
finally rolled around.
The meal was a tradi
tional Thanksgiving meal.
Each table has its own turkey,
along with dressing, pitchers of
gravy, huge bowls of mashed
potatoes, rolls, cranberry
sauce, corn, cheese and
breadsticks, pumpkin pie, and
bottles of Coke, Diet Coke,
milk, and water.

Students enjoy the Thanksgiving dinner at Servo Tuesday night. The meal provided a fun
break from the normal meal routine on campus.

Those students lucky
enought to sit in the faculty
side of the dining center got
the additional pleasure of us
ing the extra-special silverware
normally reserved for faculty.
It was also a special treat
for the students to walk in and
see Gordon Haaland, college
president, and his wife greet
ing them at the door. It pro
vided a real sense of together
ness at the college.
Students were seated at
tables, and were more than
happy to have the food
brought to them, instead of
doing the usual Servo-search.
Faculty brought the food,

bringing all of the seconds/
thirds/fourths that students
could want.
It was a treat to be served
by the faculty and administra
tion of the college. There was
also a man making balloon ani
mals for students as they waited
for the coveted table.
However, some students
were chagrined at the disap
pearance of the balloon man by
the end of the evening. There

were numerous students who
had been looking forward to
getting balloon swords at the
end of the evening. However,
as they walked towards the exit,
they were greeted only with dis
appointment.
It is every student's dream
to be served by their most infa
mous professor, the one they
had been hounded by all semes
ter. Attentive to the students'
needs, every server was great
though, and brought out what
ever was needed at each table.
All comments heard from
servers were positive. Bill
Deptula, of the College's An
nual Giving department, com¬

mented, I had a wonderful
time." Serving the tables though,
must have been a treat! At the
table I was sitting at (like many
others throughout the dining
hall), we went through two
dishes of corn, a whole turkey,
and five bowls of mashed po
tatoes.
Comments heard around
the table ranged from "Good,"
to "I'm impressed," to perhaps

Photo by Emily Glatfelter

the best comment of the
evening, "I'm going to turn into
a mashed potato!"
As far as conversation
goes, it resembled regular fam
ily dinners, when topics do not
seem to make sense, and one
end of the table does not un
derstand what the other is talk
ing about. Of course, this is
understandable, what with
each table seating groups 10 or
12 people.
Students had to round up
ten of their closest friends to
head over to the dining center.
However, if students could not
schedule dinner with that many
of their friends, the staff of the

dining center would put two
groups together. This is a great
way for students to get to know
people they never would have
met before.
The Thanksgiving dinner
is always a great time for stu
dents to grow closer and cel
ebrate in the midst of papers,
exams, and stress.
No matter how much
work was left to be done, no
matter how little time was left
before that ever-present due
date, students took the time out
to go to the dining hall and
enjoy Thanksgiving with their
friends. It has become a tradi
tion. The dinner itself, which
has been going on for fifteen
years, according to John
Myers, of the dining services,
seems to be a tradition that has
been left unchanged. However,
it was discontinued several
years ago and only resurrected
once again in 1992.

The dining center was
also quick to point out how
large an effort the dinner was
on the entire campus's part.
Housekeeping loaned out
extra chairs and tables, as there
would be a larger concentra
tion of people at the dining
hall. The service fraternity Al
pha Phi Omega ran a childcare
program for faculty who
wanted to serve, but had to find
a babysitter for their children.
In the Junction, thirteen kids
had a great time and some de
cided to come to Gettysburg
College!
Every aspect of the
evening took a lot of work
from everyone on campus.
Every comment heard was a
positive one, and upon exiting,
I heard a student say, "I wish
they would do this every Sun
day night."

For the tired feet and
backs of those who served and
baked, though, I think it is bet
ter to leave it a traditional, an
nual Thanksgiving dinner!

interval, and eat them in the
theatre, not just the lobby.
As for food, the British
often use the French name:
aubergine for eggplant, mange
tout for snow peas, and
courgette for zucchini.
Certainly there are differ
ences in pronunciation:
pahstrool (pastoral), literature
(lit-er-a-ture). Just because
someone is from Britain does
not mean they're understand
able to Americans.
There are also consider
able differences in advertising.
Billboards for cigarettes are re
quired to have the equivalent
of the Surgeon General's warn
ing in very large type below the
ad, so large it seems to be part
of the ad, affecting it in subtle
ways.

Question: Where in Brit
ain would you go to get toad
in-the-hole or bubble and
squeak? Answer: To a restau
rant, of course.
Unlike French or Italian,
British food itself may be bor
ing, but the names of the reci
pes are certainly different. I say
boring because outside of stews
and pies, like steak and kidney
pie, or fish and chips, restau
rant menus are rather limited.
And potatoes are always in
cluded.
One time, we ordered a
pie of one sort or another, and
the pie contained chunks of
potatoes, was topped with
mashed potatoes, and had a side
dish of chips (chips are French
fries, on which you sprinkle
vinegar; if you want potato
chips, you want crisps).

Speaking of "chips," there
are a number of other anoma
lies in this language that both
we and the British call "En
glish." Some words have differ
ent meanings. For example,
one of the Gettysburg students
here complimented a flatmate
on her pants. The student re
plied, "How can you see
them?" Pants are on the inside;
trousers are on the outside.
Your sweater? A jumper. And
cookies? They're biscuits.
And to avoid shock, if
you're asked for a rubber, hand
over your eraser. Get your
mind out of the gutter.
It may just be different
spelling; theatre, tyre, or
colour. And the grammar is
different; collective nouns are
treated as plural, as in "The
government are..." Also, you
live in a street, not on it: "Presi
dent Haaland lives in West
Broadway."
Sometimes it's a different

word. The generic vacuum
cleaner is referred to as the
Hoover; a round-trip ticket is
a return; the oven or range is a
cooker (although that makes
sense); and intermission is the
interval.
This reminds me with re
gard to the theatre, you have to
buy a program, and you can buy
snacks and drinks during the

One we saw said some
thing like "Cross over to taste."
A person was standing on one
side of a road, looking at a pack
of a particular brand of ciga
rettes on the other side. But
the words below the ad said
"Smoking kills," and the pack
was as big as a coffin. So at
first we thought the whole
thing was an anti-smoking ad,
and maybe it is.
Advertisements can be
much more overtly sexual here.
A large poster for WonderBra
in a store showed a woman
with a sly smile wearing the bra
and saying, "Of course. Can I
bring a couple of friends?"
And a perfume ad on tele
vision: a nude male model is

stretched out in front of an art
class. A female student walks
in late and passes by him on her
way to her easel. The model
sniffs her perfume. By the look
on his face and the giggles from
the class, we know that he is,
shall we say, aroused.
Incidentally, if you've
ever wondered what the differ
ence is between England, Brit
ain, Great Britain, and the U.K.
(United Kingdom), the answer
is: England is one of the three
countries on this Island, the
others being Scotland and
Wales. Together, these three,
plus Northern Ireland, consti
tute Britain/Great Britain/the
United Kingdom; take your
pick.

A Scream it ain't

by Jon Froehlich
Staff Writer / Know What You Did
Last Summer tells the story of
four teens who are, in essence,

being chased around by the
Gorton fisherman. If this
sounds like a dumb plot to you,
don't worry; it is a dumb plot,
even compared to those of clas
sic horror flicks

like Friday the\
13th . I
Starring
Jennifer Lovel
Hewitt (ofl

television's
Party of Five
and Dance!
Workout with
Barbie) as Julie,
this movie basi
cally involves a
beauty queen, a
whiny college
girl, an arrogant
alcoholic and a
who, accidently,
ran a man down
one night and

then tried to cover it up.
The rest of the plot goes
on to tell the story of a man no
scarier than a Scooby-Doo vil
lain hunting the kids down one
by one.
The other stars, including
Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy the
Vampire Slayer —the tv show
and Beverly Hills Family
Robinson), Ryan Phillippe
(White Squall), and Freddie
Prinze, Jr. (Detention - Siege at

Johnson High), proceed to go
their separate ways after the
accident until one fact brings
them back together - someone
knows what they did.
Even though we see the
four stars of this movie being
chased down by a hook wield
ing maniac, audiences will
most likely have trouble feel-

c

ing sorry for them because of
the marginal and transparent
acting that is presented.
Not only is / Know What
You Did Last Summer not es
pecially scary for a horror/
thriller movie (the "scary"
scenes even got a few laughs
from the audience; a college
student laughed throughout
the movie), but it is not very
well made or thought out ei
ther.

The cheesy ghost story
that the kids tell near the be
ginning of the movie is a good
preview for audiences of the
string of cliches to come.
This movie might have
been better off if it simply stuck
with the classic horror movie
blue-print instead of trying to
jazz it up with romance and
personal information

about the stars.
However, what is
a horror movie with
out that love aspect?
Though it
wouldn't be fair to

to let audiences part company
with any idea of what really
went on throughout the course
of the movie.
It seemed that this movie
relied too heavily on the repu

decessor, Scream, and didn't
really deliver to audiences as
expected.

Government in hot seat over global warming

by Kyle Heulitt
G.E.C.O. columnist
In the light of upcoming
gathering of countries in Kyoto
to adopt an agreement to pre
vent global warming, I figured
I would catch everyone up on
the subject.
What is it?
Global warming is the
rise in the average temperature
of the earth's climate due to the
buildup of greenhouse gases,
mainly carbon dioxide, meth¬

ane, nitrous oxide, and HFC's,
in the atmosphere.
In the past century, glo
bal concentrations of carbon
dioxide have increased by
about 30 percent, due to burn
ing coal, oil, and natural gas,
as well as deforestation.
America is responsible for the
lion's share of emissions - a
whopping quarter of the
world's total!
What does it mean to me?
Scientists predict that the

Earth's average global tempera
ture will rise by two to six de
grees Fahrenheit unless green
house gas emissions are reduced
substantially. This may not
sound like much of a rise, but
it could have a huge impact on
the ecosystem. Here are some
examples of what may be to
come: - more intense rainfall
and flooding in some area at
some times, and drought-like
conditions in others
- current rates of sea
level rise increasing by two to
five times due to both the ther¬

mal expansion of the oceans
and the partial melting of
mountain glaciers and polar ice
caps - in agriculture, predic
tions range from large drops to
large increases in crop yields,
depending on assumptions of
the temperature increase, po
tential benefits of increased car
bon dioxide, and adaptation
measures. One possibility is
that the viability of America's
"Bread Basket" may be threat
ened, as well as those farms that
depend on water from the
Ogaliata aquifer_.

- more frequent and
intense heat waves, which
would cause more deaths due
to the heat and aggravate local
air quality problems
- increase in the poten¬

tial geographic range and viru
lence of tropical disease
What can I do?
1) Buy energy-efficient
appliances and don't waste
electricity.
2) Buy cars with high
fuel efficiency, and don't drive
them unless you absolutely
have to.
3) Plant trees.
4) Weatherize your
home or apartment.
5) Tell your elected rep
resentatives what you think.
What is the US and the
rest of the world doing about
it? In 1992, the US and
roughly 150 other nations
signed the United Nations
Framework Convention on
Climate Change (FCCC) at the
Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro. The FCCC was rati
fied by the US in 1992 and has
now been ratified by ]66 na
tions altogether.

The main objective of
this treaty was the stabilize the
concentration of greenhouse
gas in the atmosphere at a level
that would prevent climactic
change.
The US and the other
most industrialized nations
agreed to voluntarily aim to
return their emissions back to
the 1990 levels by the year
2000.

However, the US and
most other industrialized na¬

tions are not on course to meet
ing this target: emissions in the
US are projected to be 13 per
cent higher in the year 2000
than they were in 1990.
Because these voluntary
targets have not been reached,
there is now widespread agree
ment that legally binding mea
sures are necessary.
This is the goal of the
talks in Kyoto, schedules for
December 1, in which repre
sentatives of countries through
out the world are scheduled to
gather and adopt an agreement.
Even though these nego
tiations are not far off, many
key elements of the agreement
remain unclear. The most im
portant topic of discussion will
be the amount of emissions to
be reduced and by when.
The plan President
Clinton announced was ex
tremely weak.

While the limits he called
for were legally binding, they
would not take effect for more
than a decade, and would only
serve to stabilize emissions.
Reductions would come much
later. Data obtained from

Conflict and Consensus
The Pachyderm's Pulpit
As if the first term weren't bad enough

by John Dunlap
Staff Writer 1997 has not been that
bad of a year for Bill Clinton.
He began his second term and
reached an agreement with the
Republican Congress over a
balanced budget, his approval
ratings have been relatively
strong, and the campaign fi
nance scandals have yet to
cause significant political or
legal damage. The President's
biggest trouble up until this
month has been the Paula
Corbin Jones sexual harass
ment suit and the president has
kept his distance while his law
yers challenge Paula Jones.
This month things have
changed for our 42nd Presi
dent. Three major defeats have
hit the Clinton Administration
and not only threaten his abil
ity to accomplish things over
the next three years, but put the

Democrats at a disadvantage
for the 1998 midterm elections.
The three defeats placed at the
Presidents hands just in the
month of November are his
defeat at the ballot box when
Republicans swept this years
key off-year elections, the de
feat of fast-track trade legisla
tion for Chile, and the rejection
of the president's Nominee to
be the Assistant Attorney Gen
eral for Civil Rights, Bill Lann
Lee. These three defeats not
only are evidence that the Bresi
dents reelection honeymoon is
over but has led political com
mentators to wonder if lame
duck status has hit Bill Clinton.
It seems that in the six
years since Bill Clinton first
became a Candidate for the
Presidency of the United States,
the only Democrat he has
helped is himself. Virtually
every other Democrat who he

has campaigned for has gone
down in defeat. The Demo
crats' hold on Congress was
broken and Republicans are
still winning in state elections
during the Clinton era. Things
looked like they might have
changed in 1997. The Presi
dent was the first Democrat to
have a second term since
Franklin Roosevelt, the
economy was strong and the
general feeling in the country

has been generally good. In
stead, every candidate _^^^
who the ~^^^^

President cam
paigned
for went
down to
defeat. In

cratic Nominee for Gov
e r n o r ,
State Senator J i m
McGreevy

Governor's race would help de
cide which direction the coun

behind this attack was that the

nally, in New York the Presi
dent visited to help the respec
tive Democrat Candidates for
Mayor of New York City and
for a U.S. House seat but the
Democrats lost in both races
overwhelmingly.
On Capital Hill Senate
Republicans challenged the
president's Civil Rights nomi
nee, Bill Lann Lee and now the
President is forced to either
withdrawal Mr. Lees nomina
tion or to fight for him in a
battle that he probably will be
unable to win. The Senate Ju
diciary Committee refused to
recommend Mr. Lee to the full

Senate over affirmative action
and quotas. Bill Lann Lee made
a big mistake early on when he
said that he would not uphold
lower court decisions regarding
quotas and set-asides. When he
made that remark the President
should have
dumped _^^^^^

_^^_r him.
The
purpose of
an Assistant
Attorney Gen¬

eral is to enforce
the law whether you
agree with the law or
not; if you fail to do that
than you should be replaced.
Democrats are charging Repub
licans with racism, which is
petty and stupid. I disagree
with Mr. Lee and the President
on principle not race and if the
Democrat Party is so devoid of
ideas that it must resort to piti
ful name calling then President
Clinton better get the minor
ity party in Congress in line or
trouble lies ahead come elec¬

tion day 1998.
Recently, the only thing
the Democrats in Congress
seem to be in line about is op
position to the President him
self. Bill Clinton's biggest
problems may not come from
Republicans but from within
his own party. On the fast
track legislation the President
joined Congressional Republi
cans while 80% of House
Democrats opposed the presi
dential position on free trade.
Free trade is good for America
because it creates jobs and al¬

lows for Americans to be the
first to enter new markets. The
economies of Latin America are
growing and by entering into
trade pacts with Chile and
other Latin American countries
than that allows us to get ahead
of our economic competitors to
get the goods into new and ex
panding markets. Organized
labor has taken over the Demo
cratic Caucus in the Congress
and the President of the A.F.L.
John Sweeney seems to have
more influence among Demo
crats in Congress than the
President of the United States
has. House Speaker Newt
Gingrich battled for the votes
on fast-track but the President
failed to deliver his side and
Chile and other nations south
of the Rio Grande will begin
looking elsewhere for eco
nomic trade.

Presidential second terms
have been historically worse
than first terms. President
Eisenhower faced a recession in
term number two, President
Nixon was forced to resign
over Watergate in his second
term, and President Reagan
faced Iran-Contra after his re
election. Bill Clinton may now
begin to face the trouble that
comes with a second term.
Now is the time that President
Clinton must cement his legacy
and up to this point it seems as
if scandals, the decline of lib
eralism, and the rise of the Re
publican Party is his hallmark.
If that remains so, than come
1998 and 2000 Bill Clinton
will be a liability on the Demo
cratic Candidates, and that
does not spell good news for
Democratic hopes of winning
back Congress.

Consider this

AIDS is a reality in all of
our lives.
As tragic as this illness is,
the fact that we continue to ig
nore the presence of AIDS in
our lives is far more unfortu¬

nate. Often, given our youth
and our relative inexperience,
we tend to think of ourselves as
invincible, choosing to block out
reality with the familiar and
comforting shroud of believing
that AIDS will never happen to
us or anyone close to us.
However, the harsh real
ity is that, every one of us will
know someone who will die of
this disease, and chances are,
many of us will know numerous
casualties of this disease.
As we go about our daily
lives, we are faced with a frus
trating dichotomy of being in
one of the most free times of our
lives, yet also being bound with
a heavy weight of responsibil
ity. While in general our stu
dent body is unjustly accused of
being apathetic, when it comes
to the reality of AIDS in our
lives, we are.

Most of the student body
knows what AIDS is, and given
our educational background,
most of us could give a list of
facts and figures about the dis
ease. However, it is only the ce¬

rebral statistics that we know
and not the emotional connec
tion that completely draws us
into a grim reality of the AIDS
epidemic.
We have to stop hiding
behind the cold hard facts, and
face the reality of AIDS. This
disease will pervade our lives,
affect our friends, maybe even
affect ourselves.
Since our generation is re
ally the first to get all of the facts
on AIDS, it is our responsibility
to take the initiative to continue
to learn and accept this disease.
Take the time to learn, a
little more about AIDS. Learn
more than just how it is trans
mitted and take the time to re
alize that AIDS is something hu
man, and its victims need our
support.

In short, take the time to
care. Don't wear a red ribbon
because it is fashionable, wear
it because you truly care about
AIDS and what it is doing to
those who mean something to
us. All of us are privileged to
be here at an institution of
higher learning, and we repre
sent the leaders of tomorrow.
Our time is coming. We can
teach others about AIDS, and
raise everyone's awareness.
Through our own education, we
can make a difference.

Conflict and Consensus

To the Editor:

I was very alarmed by
the content of "Be Your Own
Best Defense" by Jay Spiese,
an article in the November 13,
1997 edition of The Gettys
burgian. In some ways the
subtitle for the article "Being
responsible for yourself is the
best solution" sums up every
thing that was wrong with the
article.
I am grateful and
pleased that Mr. Spiese
brought attention to this very
important issue. It certainly
is a topic that has become a
reality for all members of the
Gettysburg College commu
nity. However, I am skeptical
of the research Mr. Spiese did
for his article. For example
the fifth "absolute truth" as it
states in the article is "You
[directed to the victim! are the

only person who can prevent
rape." This statement could
not be more false. Two people,
both the victim and perpetra
tor, can prevent a rape. Addi
tionally, this statement puts the
blame on the victim because it
sends the message that if it hap
pens to you, it is because you
did not do enough to prevent
it. Additionally, "absolute
truth" number five says that "I
can't describe how appalled I
am to hear that women are be
ing taught 'If I fight back he will
only hurt me more.'" Frankly,
Mr. Spiese, the reality is that
in a rape situation the perpe
trator often threatens the vic
tim with further violence
should the victim protest in any
way. Sometimes the best deci
sion is to fight back, sometimes

it is not. There are no "abso
lute truths" in highly volatile,
dangerous situations.
With the proposed posi
tive consent policy introduced
recently, Gettysburg College is
recognizing that both people
need to take responsibility for
their actions. Women are tired
of being declared the victim
and men are frustrated by ac
cusations that they are mon
sters. We need to make sure
that we remember that rape is
something that occurs between
two people, regardless of gen
der, and that communication
and responsibility of both
people is truly the "best solu
tion." Sincerely,
Lindsay S. Musser, '98

Conflict and Consensus

Sci-fi facist?

by James Shrader
Contributing Writer
Most people who have seen
Starship Troopers probably have
noticed a fascist tone to the futur
istic society of Starship Troopers
that is both dark and satirical.
Critics have blasted it, and some
viewers have reacted negatively to
it. In the movie, there were some
what comical newsreels interjected
throughout that would appear to
be there at least for satire, but
Verhoeven based some of these
newsreels on Nazi propaganda
films, such as the one where the
voice is asking citizen, "What have
they done?"
Beyond these newsreels
there are darker links to Nazism,

such as the fact that one of the
main characters, who works for in
telligence, wears a black leather
overcoat and other nazi-like para
phernalia (I remember overhear
ing someone who was leaving say
ing, "How ironic, they have
people who are in charge of de
stroying a race looking like the Ge
stapo!") . Many images in this
movie reek of a totalitarian state:
first and second class citizens, ex
tremely harsh punishment in the
military, such as using a whip for
corporal punishment, and con
stant linking of the army to regu
lar society (not only during the
war, before it too), and ultimately
violence being the solution to
problems.

Paul Verhoeven and the
screenwriters seem to have missed
the philosophy of what Robert A.
Heinlein was trying to get across.
However this would not be the
first time, as Heinlein's original
publisher refused to published the
work, citing the fact that
Heinlein's principles of a futuris
tic society were fascist. This
caused Heinlein to drop the pub
lisher and go with a new one. This
instance seems to be the first in a
long chain of misinterpretations
that have culminated in
Verhoeven's translation of Starship
Troopers.
The underlining philosophy
of Starship Troopers was not about
a fascist government as Utopia.
What Heinlein was trying to get
across in Starship Troopers were
the ideals of responsibility, duty,
and sacrifice, which by themselves
are in no way fascist. In the novel,

through his narration and dia
logue, Heinlein argues repeatedly
for these principles. For instance
one of his characters bemoans
welfare, argue in essence no one
should get a free ticket, and instead
should earn what they receive.
This is not surprising coming from
a man who, much to the chagrin
of fellow science fiction writers,
was a conservative.
Heinlein was strongly
against totalitarian governments.
For instance, he was against gun
control because he believed guns
were a useful deterrent to an op
pressive government. In his nov
els The Moon is a Harsh Mistress,
and Revolt in 2100, citizens revolt
against tyrannical governments
One of my favorite quotes was by
Heinlein on censorship, "Don't
make the adult drink the milk be
cause the baby can't eat the steak."
These facts alone should be
enough to dissuade any critic that
Heinlein was a fascist.

Probably one of the biggest
ironies of accusing Heinlein of
being a fascist, is the fact that the
revolutionary novel Stranger in a
Strange Land became an icon of
the sixties movement and pro
moted such ideals as acceptance,
love, and linking people and God
("Thou art God")
In the end the sarcastic por
trayal of Heinlein's vision only
ends up collapsing upon itself.
There is nothing wrong of course
with responsibility, duty, and sac
rifice, and it would seem
Verhoeven's portrayal and critics'
responses to Starship Troopers are
paranoid responses to anything
close to fascism, no matter how re
mote. Heinlein's ideals should be
looked upon like required commu
nity service, like in my highschool,
which in part made me a better
person while helping those in
need.

I suggest people read
Starship Troopers, not only be
cause it is an excellent novel, but
also to draw their own conclu
sions. I also suggest reading other
Heinlein novels, such as Stranger
in a Strange Land, none of which
promote fascism in my opinion.

Advances in computer architectures
and networks are bringing parallel
computing to more than the typical
users of supercomputers. Unfortu
nately, programmers quickly find that
writing and verifying correct parallel
programs is a much more difficult
task than writing sequential pro
grams. One of the most important
challenges in parallel computing is
providing programmers with software
tools like the tools they currently
enjoy for sequential programming. In
particular, there is a lack of software
testing tools for this paradigm of
programming. In this talk, we will
examine how the intrinsic nature of
parallel programs complicates the
task of providing software tools to
parallel programmers. A brief
overview of the state-of-lhe-art will
be presented. All students and
faculty are invited.

His shoes were made for running
... AND THAT'S JUST WHAT THEY'LL DO

By Chesha Miller
Staff Writer Putting his all into every
thing he does, senior Jason
Smith generates great results. As
a three season athlete, running
cross country, indoor and out
door track, it is a wonder how
Jason finds the time to partici
pate in all his activities. For the
second consecutive year Jason,
who is fondly known as Jay to
his teammates and friends, is a
Residence Assistant.
He is also a member of
Students for Ethical Action
(SEA), Bacchus and Allies. "I try
to get involved with as much as
I can and am supportive of the
groups [on campus] I believe
in," he commented. In addition,
Jason is a Teacher's Assistant for
a math and a computer science
class. Smith, who has been a TA
since his sophomore year, really
enjoys being able to help out in
the classroom.

When it comes down to it
though, Jason's favorite activity
has been running. "Running is
something I always need to do,"
he explained, "I love what I get
from running; it soothes me and
is a stress relief, and I am able
to be with the team I love." He
also loves the feeling of being in
shape and of constantly improv
ing and competing against him
self. Smith began his running
career as a seventh grader and
has continued to run ever since.
In high school Jason ran for
Council Rock High School,
where he struggled to make the
varsity team. Gettysburg Cross
Country and Track and Field
coach Robert Condon attributes
Jason's struggle to overtraining.
When Smith came to Gettysburg
in 1994 his luck began to
change.

Running half the per week
mileage he had run in high
school, Jason was running at the
top of Gettysburg's varsity team.
During Smith's first year, the
team, which he was a key part
of, qualified for the National
Division III Cross Country
Championships. That season
Jason was named to the All-Re
gional freshmen team.
As a sophomore, Smith
finished 15th and 25th, respec
tively, at the Centennial Confer¬

ence and Regional Cross Coun
try Championships. The follow
ing year he improved his perfor
mance, in a conference and re
gion which becomes more com
petitive each year, to 13 and 22
place, respectively.
During his junior year, Ja
son, who was a captain of the
cross country team, was awarded
the Captain Michael D. Scotton
scholarship award. The award is
given annually to a junior run
ner who demonstrates a high de
gree of extracurricular activity
and diligence to his academic
work. The recipient is chosen by
the coach and athletic director.
Jason was also honored that fall
for having had the highest GPA
among athletes in the spring of
1996, an honor which he shared
with teammate George Torgun.
Because of his superior academic
and athletic performance, Smith
was named to the coaches asso
ciation Academic All-American
team his sophomore, junior and

years.
This season, his final for
cross country, Smith ran at the
top of Gettysburg's tight pack of
runners. At the Centennial Con
ference championships, Jason ran
with his whole heart through the
treacherous rain and mud.
Smith's performance was one of
his best, he finished second for
Gettysburg and ninth in the race.
He earned second team All-Cen
tennial Conference honors for
hisaccomplishment.
This past weekend at the
Regional Championships held at
Dickinson College, Jason moved
his way up from the third to the
first runner on Gettysburg's
team. Smith, who had a very
good cross country season, ended
on a positive note finishing 34th
in the region.

Prior to the regional race
Smith said, "I would like to fin
ish regionals and be proud of
what we've done. I don't con
centrate on winning, I don't like
to label goals. I'll be psyched if
we do the best we can." Jason
has every reason to be psyched.
Smith is also looking forward to
the upcoming track season. "I
had a great season last year," he
noted, "and I'd like to do that
again, I'm really excited about
it." Condon has been really im¬

pressed with Smith's running.
"He has run number one on a
team with a lot of comparable
talent," Condon commented.
"I _always know Jason
Smith is going to run really well."
With cross country behind him,
Condon must now look towards
the track season. He has high
hopes for Jason to continue to
be a presence on the team and
to have a rewarding, worth while
spring semester.
"I hope Jason is able to see
some more personal records be¬

fore he leaves. I know we
haven't tapped into all of his abil
ity yet and I'd like him to leave
saying he's done the most he
can." Condon also believes
Smith to be one of the best lead
ers and captains the team has
ever had. "He is a good leader
because he is a positive person,"
explained Condon. "Jay has a
high energy level and is funda
mentally happy. He knows if you
want to be happy, you have to
be happy first and then figure
your problems out."

For Jason, part of figuring
his problems out is finding the
time to balance all of his activi
ties. Condon believes Jason is
able to focus and achieve so
much because of his "keen and
focused intelligence." Condon
said, "[Jay] focuses on the impor
tant issues at hand and because
he is bright he is able to work
fast. He also has very good time
management skills."
Jason does not think about
how he manages to have the time
to do all he does, he simply does

it. "It's never been that hard to
do," Smith explained, "It's set in
my mind practice is from 4 until
6:30 every day and Saturday is
always for running, it's not us
able time. I have always been
able to get everything done." Ja
son also explained how he puts
all of himself into everything he
does. "I hate to short change one
thing for another. I am very fo
cused and I want to do the best I
can do. "[Running] has been a
lot of fun and a great part of my
experience at school," Jason
commented.

It has given me so many
memories. Some of my best
friends are on the team, that is
something really significant."
Though Jason is going to miss

the team very much, he is now
moving on to bigger things.
Smith, who is physics
and math double major, with
a minor in computer science,
is looking towards graduate
school. He would like to get
his Ph.D. and apply all he has
learned in math, physics and
computer science, as that is
what he loves to do.
In the meantime, most
importantly, Jason is busy
planning his June wedding
with fiance Helen DeVinney.

machine.

Smith's outlook on life ema
nates upon his fellow team
mates and coaches.
He will be sorely
missed. In talking about
coach/athlete relationships,
Condon said, "I don't know
how much he really needed
from me. It is entirely pos
sible he's affected me more.
He is a real joy to coach and
I will miss him."
Condon does believe
Smith will continue to influ
ence the cross country and

track teams after he has gone
because of what he has instilled
in the younger runners. "He
will leave a legacy on the team,"
said Condon.

The hardest running man on campus

by Rob Thompson
Contributing Writer/ B.A.S.S
member Name: Alex Franyo
Age: 21
Sports: Cross Country
& Track
Major: Theatre Arts
Year: Junior
Hobbies/Interests: 70's
& 80's Music, Sports
(especially college)
From across one of
Gettysburg's quads you may
hear a distinctive voice calling
out a familiar phrase: "How
ya doing buddy?" Instantly you
know it's the voice of the run
ning machine, "Big Al" Franyo.
Alex is a member of both the
Cross Country and Track
Teams, and loves to compete in
long distance races.

Alex first became inter
ested in running when he was
a freshmen in high school at St.

Paul's in Baltimore. Always
being interested in sports, he
would frequently visit coaches
and talk to them about their
teams. Once, when speaking
to the Cross Country Coach, he
was asked if he would be inter
ested in being the team's man
ager. After a year of helping
the team with water and tim
ing, he new that the following
year he'd be running too.
Last year was Alex's first
chance to compete at the col
lege level due to an injury prior
to his first year at Gettysburg.
Unfortunately, early in this sea
son, he reinjured his leg, hav
ing a stress fracture in his left
tibia. Right now he's staying
in shape by using a step ma
chine where he does a cardia
vascular work out. Soon he
plans to start running short dis
tances and gradually move up
to longer distances once more.
Recently Alex has be
come very involved with the

theatre program, even declar
ing Theatre Arts his major.
Alex draws many of his running
experiences to the theatre and
vise versa. "They're both simi
lar in that both acting and
sports are entertaining, you're

always in the spotlight. Both
are a motivation for life," Alex
says. "Running is an art," he
proclaims.
Alex hopes that his train
ing in both running and the

theatre will help him accom
plish his goal in life, being a
sports broadcaster on ESPN.
Look to see Big Al in the fu

Cross country runs all over the competition

By Peter Huminski
Staff Writer Determined is one word
that is often used to describe a
distance runner. This adjective
is a good word to be used in
describing the Gettysburg Col
lege cross country teams.
The Bullet cross country
teams' seasons, which began in
August, came to an end Satur
day when both the men's and
women's teams competed in
the NCAA Mid-East Regional
Meet at Dickinson College.
Having to overcome in
juries, illness, and the weather
both teams competed hard.
The men's team finished 8 in
the 41 team field; while the
women finished 14 out of 43

.
Leading the way for the
Gettysburg women was senior
Wendy Johnston who finished

18. Her finish earned her a spot
on the All Mid-East Regional
cross country. Her time of
19:53 was just eight seconds off
of qualifying individually for
the NCAA championships to be
held in Boston this weekend.
"I thought that going into
it that since we were coming off

of some illness, if we stayed in
the top 15 I would be happy,
and we did that," said Bullets
coach Robert Condon. "We
had some people that have
been ill and that hurts. We
aren't ten people deep, so we
can't afford to have important
people sick for these kinds of

meets.
Suffering from a back in
jury senior Martie Calello fin
ished second for the Bullets and
65th overall in a time of 20:56.
Rounding out the rest of the
Bullet harriers were Joyce
O'Neil (88, 21:29), Kelley
Lord (152, 22:37), Karen
Helmick (168, 22:54), Kristin
Mills (172, 22:59), and Kim
Heimerl (195, 23:39).
In the men's race, senior
Jason Smith started out in the
middle of the pack and worked
his way up to lead the Bullets
with his thirty-second place fin
ish. He covered the 8000
meter course in 27:24 good
enough for a spot on the All
Mid-East Regional team.
"Jason Smith was really
strong for us," said Condon.
"He started out in the middle
of the pack and came on really
strong at the end. He did a
great job for us."

Kris Weum was the Bul
lets number two finisher com
ing across the line thirty-sixth
place in a time of 27:31. James
Smith (48t, 27:46), Jon Catlett
(61, 28:05), Brendon Clark
(70, 28:14), Dave Gary (98,
28:39) and Brina Rusignolo
(180, 30:42) rounded out the
Bullets top seven.
"Jon did a really great
job," said Coach Condon. " I
was really happy with his per
formance, considering he had
been laid up so long with inju
ries." Catlett's finish place him
on the All Mid-East Regional
freshmen team. He was the
seventh freshman to cross the
finish line.
"On a decent day we
would have been in the top
five," said Condon. "I can't
fault guys who are sick. They
ran hard and I am happy about
that."

After big win, the men's soccer team will host NCAA's

From Gettysburg Sports Release
What started out as 40
teams in pursuit of the NCAA
Division III national title in
men's soccer is down to eight
teams still in the running for
the ultimate prize. Gettysburg
Gollege is one of the remain
ing eight.
After going 14-3-2 during
the regular season, Head Coach
Dave Wright's squad defeated
Johns Hopkins 5-4, and
Muhlenberg, 2-1 in overtime.
With this win the Bullets cap
tured the Mid-Atlantic Re
gional and advanced to the
quaterfinals of the 1997 NCAA
Division III Men's Soccer
Championship.
The Bullets oppenent will
be the College of New Jersey,
the defending Division III na
tional Champion. The game
will be played Saturday (No
vember 22) in Gettysburg,
starting at noon.

The Bullets enter
Saturday's game riding a 15
game unbeaten streak, the
longest in school history. With
a victory on Saturday, they
would tie a school record for
wins in a season.

Sophomore forward
Chris Pryor (Lawrenceville,
NJ), scored both of the Bullet's
victories at regionals to boost
his team-leading total this sea
son to 17 goals. He has ac
counted for the game-winning
goal against Muhlenberg, scor
ing 2:02 into the second over
time. Senior midfielder Gre
gory Stevcic, (Medford, NJ) has
supplied the Bullets with 12
goals and 15 assists so far dur
ing the 1997 campaign. He
holds numerous school
records: goals in a season (21)
goals in a career (45), assists in
a season (15) and assists in a
career.
Senior Midfielder Brian
Hill (Odenton, Md) and
sophmore forward Jason
Vishio (Reading, Pa), have con
tributed seven goals.
Midfielder Jeremy Shapiro,
(Leonia_, NJ) is the leading
scorer among freshman with
four goals and three assists.

Junior goalie, Jon
Katerba_, (Scotch Plains,NJ), is
closing in on the school record
for carrer shotout. Including

Bullets get ball rolling

From Gettysburg Press release
With no less than 12 let
ter winners and all five starters
from last years 13-12 team,
Gettysburg College head
women's basketball coach
Mike Kirkpatrick has a bright
future.
The only draw back that
he faces in the opening basket
ball, tournament this week at
Frostburg State is the fact that
two players just joined the team
from the women's NCAA
bound soccer team, and several
are still studying abroad and
won't be back until January.
Gettysburg will compete
in the McDonald's Classic at
Frostburg, facing host
Frostburg Friday afternoon in

the 4 p.m. second game.
Kenyon will play Montclair
State in the 2 p.m. opener. The
consolation game will be
played Saturday at 2:00 p.m.
followed by the 6:00 p.m.
championship game.
Junior Megan Malloy has
returned from overseas, but has
missed several weeks of work
outs. She paced the Bullets
with 11.2 points and 9.9 re
bounds per game a year ago.
Courtney Marotta, will
not return until January. The
three remaining starters should
be ready to go this weekend.
They include Jaime Dawson,
Jen Dravis, and Julie
Hawthorne. All of this ladies
played a signifigant role last
season and will continue this

season.
Jen Dravis averaged 13.1
points per game, while twin sis
ter Steph came off the bench
to average 9.8 tallies a contest.
Waiting in the wings _alons with
Dravis will be sophomre
Lauren Frankford, sophmore
Carrie Kulp, and senior Beth
O'Boyle.
This year's schedule
should also help Kirkpatrick in
the early season preparation of
his team. Following the tour
nament, Gettysburg plays three
of it next four games on the
home court before breaking for
Christmas. When they return
on January 9 and 10, the Bul
lets will host the annual Days

TKE renovations to begin

Brothers set to move back into house in fall semester

By Laura Root
Staff Writer After months of prepa
ration, the Tau Kappa Epsilon
fraternity is ready to begin re
pairing its house.
Alumnae donations are
adding up and the renovations
are planned to begin this
spring and continue into the
summer. TKE brothers are
planning on moving in next
fall. Currently, all fraternity
members are living in off
campus locations.
When $50,000 worth of
damage was done to the fra
ternity house lastspring, it was
immediately closed down.
The damage to the
house was caused last semes
ter during final's week, when
a number of Tau Kappa Epsi
lon brothers caused a great
deal of damage to their own
residence.

Renovations for the
house had been scheduled pre
vious to the incident, but were
pushed back because of the
amount of damage done to the
house.
The repairs include add
ing sprinklers, fire escapes,
and improving the quality of
the rooms inside the house.

Because of the incident,
which forced TKE to close
down its house, the fraternity
brothers have been looking into
' ways to deter such destructive

behavior.
Brothers have undergone
interviews with the national
chapter of TKE. National lead
ers of TKE have suggested new
rules and codes of conduct for
its Gettysburg College chapter.
Additionally, punish
ments for poor behavior will be
enacted more harshly than they
have in the past.
The problems that TKE
has had have tarnished its repu
tation both on the local and na
tional levels. However, the
members are working hard to
change the perception that
people might currently have of
it. Professor John
Commito, the faculty advisor to
TKE, is working hard to keep
the academic performance of
its members exemplary. Danny
Smith, TKE president, and the
rest of the fraternity have been
working hard on service
projects for the Gettysburg
community.

"We are trying our hard
est to repair the damages," says
Smith, "and all the brothers
will be happy to move back into
TKE next fall."

Living with HIV

Early treatment the key to living longer with the virus

by Darcy Daniels and
Miranna Smith
Contributing Wuters
You were worried about
HIV. You had a few close en
counters. You got tested and
you found out that you are
HIV positive. All of your
worst fears have been con
firmed. You are afraid, you
fee] alone, and you don't know
where to turn. What do you
do now? This news can be
very shocking, but it is impor
tant to face this crisis and learn
how to live with HIV.
The subject of AIDS and
HIV is a very personal, confi
dential topic. It is also very
scary. There is a large support
network that you can turn to
that can help you sort out your
feelings.
If you don't feel com-

I fortable discussing this with
your family or friends, there
are people on campus that
are available to discuss your
fears with you. Their names
have been printed in this is
I sue of the Gettysburgian.
You can also call your local
HIV/AIDS service organi
zation, because they can re
fer you to a physician or
, clinic experienced in the
[ care of HIV/AIDS patients.
You now have to live
your life differently. Many
people live long lives once
they find out they are HIV
positive, but the key to long
life is early intervention.
You need to find out what
combination of treatment
may be right for you. You
need to go see a doctor to
discuss your options.
Besides seeing a doc¬

tor, there are more personalized
steps that you can take such as
eating a balanced diet. Good nu
trition can help your body fight
infections.
Rest is also essential for the
body to renew strength, resist ill
ness, and relieve stress.
Exercise, good hygiene,
and avoiding drugs and alcohol
are three important steps to help
you lead a healthy lifestyle.
Finding out that your are
HIV-positive is critical to your
relationships with others. HIV is
spread through blood, semen,
breastmilk and vaginal fluid.
This means that it can be
spread to others during sex, by
sharing needles, or during preg
nancy. You can reduce the risk of
transmittal to others by using la¬

tex condoms, every time, if you
decide to have sex. Though they
do not eliminate the risk of infect
ing someone else, it highly re
duces the risk.
Other important prevention
factors include never sharing
needles, razors or toothbrushes,
not donating blood, and telling
your partner and your health care
providers about your infection.
You are not alone in your
crisis. You have a lot of informa
tion, a lot of support, and a lot of
love from your family and
friends. Hopefully, a cure is in
sight, but in the meantime, be re
sponsible for yourself and others.

Celebrating in style

by Cara Masucci
Staff Writer After the last dishes are
cleared from the table on
Thanksgiving, everyone is
looking forward to the upcom
ing holiday season. Whether
it is for Christmas, Hanukkah,
or Kwanza, decorations are
hung from all corners of the
house. Walking down the
street, one is greeted with
bright lights and well-known
symbols of the holidays. Gifts
are exchanged, and families
gather together to give thanks
for their happiness. It becomes
a custom to every person,
young and old.
Christmas is probably the
best known holiday of the year,
due to the fact that a majority
of the country celebrates it. It
is the day that Christians cel¬

ebrate the birth of Jesus Christ,
the Son of God, who was born

into the world to save people
from original sin. It is a day of
great rejoicing across the world
for many Christians. Many
families gather together to cel
ebrate by going to services
and gathering for large
meals on the twenty-fifth _^
of December. _^
One of the major H
facets of Christmas is _^M
the Christmas tree. _^^^H

On campus, a
candlelight Christmas
service will take place
on Monday at 9 p.m.
in the Chapel. The
College and Chapel
Choirs will also be
performing on Satur
day and Sunday at 8
p.m., in the Chapel.
The campus can also
gather together on
Tuesday for the all
campus Christmas


party. Hanukkah, a celebration

ebrated every year on the
twenty-fifth day of the Hebrew
month of Kislev. It is an eight
day celebration with one candle
lit each night on the menorah,
or hanukkiyah.

The celebration of Ha
nukkah also includes the ex
changing of gifts, as well as the
giving to those who are less for
tunate. The celebration also
includes a well-known Hanuk¬

kah game of chance called
Dreidle. The Dreidle is played
with a four-sided top, each side
marked with a Hebrew
character that ends up k
spelling the sentence (9

Although each holiday is

I want to talk about the
constant taste of vomit I've got
in my mouth because my pills
make me sick, and about the
constant nausea I carry with me
right next to the thought, "I am
dying." I want to talk about the

fact that she didn't look sick,
didn't say she was sick, told me
she loved me, then gave it to me
(or me to it?) anyway.
Oh, you don't want to
hear about that, either? How
about the fact that my hope
rises and falls with my T-cells,
and that to me, vitamin C is no
longer "nature's candy" but an
unreliable lifesaver? Avoid cer
tain death by avoiding the com
mon cold.
Every week I have to take
a stool sample to my doctor and
try and ignore the fact that
people are staring at my thin
ning hair and my lesions.
Sometimes, I can't even hold it
when I have to go to the bath
room. Are you still going to tell
me that putting a piece of rub
ber on your penis (his penis,
whoever's penis) is embarrass
ing? It ruins the mood? So will
your funeral, because sex with
a dead body isn't much fun.

If I asked you right now
if you were like me, how sure
would your answer be? Are you
safe? Are you healthy? Are you
dying? Let's face it, any of us
who's fooled around, who's
"done it" with any opening,
who's tasted the "forbidden
fruit" (among other things) is
healthy purely by chance. How
sure are you?
I was sure, but when I
scratched off my lottery ticket,
it said I had it, I won. I played
Russian roulette with my geni
tals and I caught the bullet. All
things considered, I'd rather
have had the consolation prize.
Now I get consolation. Have
you joined my winner's circle?
How sure are you?

In October, I went on a
service learning project to New
York City. I spent some time
laughing, some time shopping
and a wonderful evening at a
Broadway show.
I also spent a great deal

of time with people who don't
do much of any of the above. I
prepared food for an organiza
tion that exists solely to deliver
meals to AIDS patients who can
no longer leave their house,
except for their obligatory
doctor's visits.
I saw what it's like to be
completely dependant on oth
ers. I understood what it's like
to be panic-stricken over ruin
ing a bowl of lettuce by sneez
ing openly in its vicinity (all
food prepared for the clients
must be kept completely germ
free). I learned what it feels like
to brighten an eight year old's
day (who, incidentally, knows
that he's dying) by giving him
an extra helping of dessert.
I have seen the faces of
the dying patients, and no mat
ter how beautiful I have come
to view them as, they are still
tragic. It is in their honor that
I write this, but they are still
dying. Are you? How sure are

you? These days, to say that
someone is "positive" is not to
describe his or her outlook on
life. Positive certainly doesn't
describe the death that the per
son is facing.
Get tested, be safe. Live
life freely, have sex cautiously,
play carefully. And if you know
someone who's got AIDS or
HIV, hug them—hard. Think
of it as giving them an extra
dessert.

Plugging for studying
abroad

by Mark Berg
England Correspondent

THE FOLLOWING IS A
COMMERCIAL ANNOUN
CEMENT:
I was back in Gettysburg
briefly (the fares are low in
November, and my wife had
papers to grade and research to
do) and noticed, on the bulle
tin board, an announcement of
a meeting on December 5 to
explain the College's program
in London and the University
of Essex next Fall.
Since none of the current
students can attend, I thought
that if you are interested in the
program, I'd give you my per
ception of the program and
how the students have benefit
ted. When I attended a simi
lar meeting, I — and I think
some of the other attendees —
came away thinking the previ
ous students had been on one
long vacation. To some extent,
that's true.

A lot of this year's stu
dents have been to Scotland,
Ireland, Holland, Belgium,
France, Germany, all around
England, and elsewhere, singly
or in groups. Clearly, one of the
benefits of being in Britain is
its proximity to the Continent;
and being students, the cost of
travel is about as low as it can
be. There was also much talk
about student life at the Uni
versity of Essex: the drinking
age in Britain is 18, there don't
seem to be as many quizzes and
tests in the classes; and because
they're there for only half a
school year and most courses
are a year long, the professors
were lenient in grading the
Gettysburg students.

That, at first, is definitely
true, but I don't believe the
Gettysburg students in Essex
now feel like they're coasting.
Of course, you can travel to
Europe without being in the
program; I've been told that
some students under 21 at
Gettysburg have been known
to drink beer; and not having
as much school work to do
without worrying about your

grade (if in fact true) may ap
peal to a few students.
But what I have observed
in the students, the change I
have seen in them since we ar
rived, is, well, I guess it could
be called sophistication as de
fined in the dictionary: sophis
ticated character, ideas, tastes,
or ways as the result of educa
tion, worldly experience, etc.
That education, that worldly
experience, is not due to just
traveling in foreign countries,
but day-to-day living and learn¬

ing in another culture, having
formal and informal contacts
with other than waiters or tour
guides.
It's as simple as recogniz
ing that the British don't drive
on the wrong side of the road,
they drive on the other side.
Or, in the case one of the
Gettysburg students, having a
great meal prepared by and in
the company of the visiting
parents of a Greek flatmate. Or
another with a French flatmate
who likes to cook.

What's not as obvious,
and perhaps unexpected, is
that they are learning in their
classes how the rest of the
world views America, and how
its history and actions are in
terpreted by others.
From their classmates and
flatmates, they gained an un
derstanding how others view
their history, and how our
knowledge of other societies
and cultures may are not be
accurate. Given especially the
make-up of the student body of
the University of Essex, drawn
from more than 110 countries,
multi-culturalism is far from
being an abstract idea; here it's
around you all day, every day.
Gettysburg students, meet the
world, so to speak.

So, not matter what you
may hear at the meeting, if you
are open to being "altered by
education, experience, etc., so
as to be worldly-wise; not na
ive," - and have a great time
while doing it - this is the pro
gram for you.
Just remember, there may
not be a Gettysburg teacher's
husband to bring back boxes of
Kraft Macaroni & Cheese.

Reel Hits & Misses
Resurrected Alien a clone

by Jon Froehlich
Staff Writer
"You can't stop it; it's in
evitable" - Ellen Ripley
Though Ellen Ripley,
played, yet again, by Sigourney
Weaver (Alien 7-7/7, Dave) was
referring to the alien force that

she knew would
eventually kill ev
eryone on board
her ship, her state
ment is also ideal
for describing the
movie Alien IV -
Resurrection.
After parts
one through three
of Alien were so
successful at the
box offices, it
should come as no
surprise that a
fourth movie was
made. The discus
sion of this movie
is one of the sim
plest in a long

. are
no deep characters, no com
plex story line and no gut
wrenching emotion. There is
just four times the chases, four
times the flesh ripping, drool
covered aliens and four times
the big guns.
Basically, what it all
comes down to is whether or
not you enjoyed Alien I through
III. If you liked those, you'll,
most likely, not be let down by

Alien TV - Resurrection.
With this being director
Jean Pierre Jeunet's first major
American movie, he had to get
creative to make it work. He
saw what needed to be done
and did it.
In order to get this movie
off the ground, two things

needed to happen - the aliens
had to come back and so did
Ripley. Considering that both
Alien and Ripley met their de
mise in a pit of flaming lava at
the end of Alien III, this task
was not an easy one.
Jeunet continues the
Alien saga two hundred years
later through the use of a shady
military experiment. The op¬

eration, ol course, goes horri
bly wrong, and the action
comes in when Ripley is forced
to stand up and face her old
enemy again.
Though the cloning of
Ripley and of the aliens may
sound incredibly contrived,
and even a bit desperate, we
can let that go because of

what kind of a movie we're
dealing with. Jeunet does,
however, earn a little
more credit for his cre
ative input of a slight
maternal connection
/j\V between Ripley
jnil and the main
_,UH alien.

A Thanksgiving in the Pilgrim's homeland

by Mark Berg
England Correspondent

sels sprouts, parsnips, and, of
course, cranberry sauce.
For dessert, we were of
fered a choice of apple pie or
pecan pie (but not like Ameri-

the Brits, with no comparable
Thanksgiving, knew when to
start their holiday shopping.
The answer: November 5, Guy
Fawkes Day. Guy Fawkes Day

ready to start counting the days
until we leave.
It's either that, or the fact
that the days are now so short,
with sunset before 4 p.m., mak
ing it a little gloomy. We cer
tainly cannot complain about
the weather; it's been below
freezing only a few nights, and
until this morning, we've had
hardly any rain. And, witness
the students in Paris, there are
still some places we plan to
visit. Though we have been
here for a few months, we
haven't gotten to see all of Eu
rope, and our time is running
out. As one student said, "it's
a bittersweet feeling; we have
seen a lot, we have had experi
ences we will never forget, and
most important, we now have
friends here. Still, we're ready
to go home."

Thanksgiving in Britain
was just another day; no big
football games, no family gath
erings, no traditional holiday
greetings from students ("My
ride is leaving early").
But most of us (a few ac
tually preferred to go to Paris
with their art history class)
wanted to be together and cel
ebrate in the spirit of the holi
day. So, 31 Americans (some
from other schools) and 22
Brits (in the American Studies
program) joined for a Thanks
giving dinner.
We met at the Greyhound
Pub in Wivenhoe. After drinks
in the pub, we went to a pri
vate room on the second floor
for the actual feast. The meal
consisted of turkey (white meat
only) with gravy, stuffing (of a
sort), roasted and mashed po
tatoes (they do like their pota
toes here), peas, carrots, brus-

"This celebra
tion has capped
our experience
here."-

can pecan pie, more like an
apple pie with a layer of
chopped pecans) topped with
either whipped cream or cus
tard. I did note, however, that
some of the American students
(not the Gettysburgians!) and
the Brits used their utensils Eu
ropean style; how unAmerican.
I wondered aloud how

is the anniversary of the day
that Guy Fawkes tried to blow
up the Houses of Parliament.
Though not widely known out
side of England, it's actually
something of a big deal there.
All agreed that it was a
very good meal in excellent
company. But it also seems as
if this celebration has capped
our experience here, and we're

This is the last of the re
ports from Mark Berg in En
gland. The students will be
back in time for our finals.

Fools won't rush to this
movie

by Glen Beck
Staff Writer "You are everything I
knew I always wanted" —
"Whatever you do, don't tell
them I picked you up outside a
restroom." Who ever thought
you would hear those two lines
in the same movie? They can
be heard in director Andy
Tennant_'s 1997 film Fools Rush
In. The film only lasted a short
time in the theater, but if you're
in a sappy, sentimental mood,
I think it is an enjoyable film.

Granted, if you're not
high on life at the time of
watching the movie-you'll find
many a problem with the plot
and the situation itself. Panned
by other reviewers as one of the
forgettable movies of the year,
the film is saved by one thing:
Salma Hayek, who portrays
Isabel Fuentes. She is a breath
of fresh air and gives one of the
most believable performances
I have seen in a long time.
Matthew Perry {Friends) also
stars. He is quite

Chandleresque, which is fine
for this film, but I hope he
learns to play another type of
character. Actually, he provides
the much needed comedy
through the overly long film.
The major problem is the
storyline is rather predictable.
After a chance meeting in Las
Vegas and a night together at
his place, a young American
construction supervisor, Alex
Whitman, leaves Mexican pho
tographer Isabel Fuentes preg
nant. She finds him a few
months later to let him know
what happened. In the rush of
the moment, he follows her and
they decide to get married. Af
ter that, a clash of customs and
ideas develops in their families
and in their relationship be
cause of their different cultural
and national backgrounds.

Now, I don t know if you
believe me or not, but I did
watch the movie twice in two
different mind sets and believe
me, if you're in a good mood
you will enjoy it. Otherwise,
stay away.

Conflict and Consensus

Condoms Lessons from abroad

don't cover it

by Jay Spiese
Contributing Writer
On this past Monday we
all received little red ribbons in
honor of AIDS awareness
week. Included with this was
an envelope containing
condoms. On the way back to
my house, I thought about
what this was saying to people
on campus.
I see students walking
across campus wearing these
little ribbons. They take pride
in wearing them. It shows they
are socially concerned. Besides
it's fashionable. There is some
thing false in these ribbon cam
paigns. We wear them because

we want to raise awareness
about AIDS on our campus. I
tell you that if there is anyone
on this campus who doesn't
know how you get AIDS, then
they have been living in a plas
tic bubble for eighteen years.
Also, I ask you, how does wear
ing a ribbon educate, let alone
prevent the transmission of
HIV? It doesn't. It is just an
other example of a culture
where symbolism is valued over
action. Besides, both you and
I know that the same people
wearing these ribbons all week
have no problems sleeping with
the first person to walk by at a
party.

As for the more difficult
question of condoms. The
Health Center has them avail
able to students free of charge.
It takes at most ten minutes to
go in, pick one up, and head
back to your dorm. Instead
someone decided that this was
not enough. Condoms must be
distributed through the campus
mail. There is nothing naive or
Puritan in my views. I know
that there is a segment on cam
pus that will have sex no mat¬

ter what. Neither do I have a
problem with consenting adults
doing whatever they want.
But, in addressing this I am
going to break one of Gettys
burg College's taboos. Where
in all of AIDS week does absti
nence come in to the discus
sion? There is a significant
number, though not majority,
of students who have chosen to
abstain from sex until marriage.
Let us face it, this is not an en
vironment that supports that
decision.
In our freshmen year, the
Health Center comes around to
the dorms and gives a program
on contraceptives. If they men
tion abstinence at all it is only
in passing. These profession
als treat it as an abnormality or
a joke.

Socially these brave indi
viduals who abstain are pres
sured by their friends. Sex on
this campus is often a way to
social acceptability. We all
know women who start sleep
ing with men to become popu
lar. I know a woman who pa
thetically enough, slept with a
man anytime he wanted to just
so she could say she had a boy
friend. She knew he used her
only for her body. Sometimes
she would be in tears because
of something he said or did.

But come the weekend she
would put out just to have
someone she could say loved
her. Even when he slept with
another woman she didn't
change.
Perhaps I am alone on this
issue. I don't know and I don't
care. Someone needs to say that
abstinence is a legitimate and
honorable choice. Since no one
else will say it this week, this is
for everyone who believes in
abstinence: You made a great
choice.

Student finds questions and answers in Japan

To the Gettysburgian: I
appreciate the copies of the
burgtan sent to me by the Study
Abroad office. I know there are
a number of fellow students
studying all over the world that
appreciate it too. I wanted to
write to you in the hopes of
relaying one of my invaluable
experiences while studying
abroad in Japan. Gettysburg
College offers wonderful op
portunities to spend some time
away from Gettysburg, and I
hope incoming students can
benefit from those that have
already "been there, done it."
It is hard for me to be
lieve that my stay in Japan is
almost over. I came halfway
across the globe hoping to find
some answers to the numerous
questions I had about Japanese
people, their culture, and their
history. I wanted to dispel
myths-draw my own clear im
age about what it is to be Japa
nese. Naive, I know, but the
effort was made.

I looked for it by open
ing an old book to a page long
forgotten. A four-leaf clover,
memento of some exuberant
afternoon in the grass, falls to
the floor and reminds me that
life is both long and short, that
love fades and luck changes.
Somewhere south of Nara, in
a farfetched corner of the
Yamato Plain, is a little six
teenth-century temple town.
Imai-cho, once a rich and pow
erful city surrounded by over a
mile of moat and a 12 ft.-high
wall, is now a quiet backwater
town with a maze of streets too
narrow and people too careful
to accommodate much twenti
eth century nonsense. That this
wooden, tile-roofed town has
stood nearly intact for over 400
years makes it a historical phe
nomenon rarely found in all of

Japan, and one of the Kansai
district's best kept secrets.
The history of Imai-cho
goes back even further. When
the emperor Kammu moved his
court from Nara to Kyoto in
the eighth century,'he refused
to allow the ambitious temple
priests of Nara to accompany
him. As compensation, he
awarded large tracts of land to
these priests, one of which was
in the Yagi area in the center of
the Yamato Plain. The Yagi
tract was strategically located
at the crossroads of two major
highways and was from the
start a village of wealthy land
owners. The powerful
Kofukuji Temple in Nara
wasted no time in imposing a
stifling tax on their smaller
neighbor. A rebellion took
place in 1532 which left the
village in ashes.
Ever since Imai-cho

gained recognition 20 years ago
as an important historic town,
the people of Imai have taken
the future of their formerly
obscure habitat as a matter of
life-and-death importance.
With streets too narrow for cars
(much less buses), they decided
to build parking lots and an
information hall outside the
borders of the town itself. Dis
inclined, however, to have their
town turned into another tour
ist attraction, the people of
Imai require that people seri
ously interested in seeing their
homes apply by telephone will
in advance. This decision has
kept Imai-cho from suffering
the ravages of the mass-tourist
industry that has plagued cit
ies like Kyoto for so long.

Although changes and
additions have been made to
some of the houses that are in
compatible with the traditional
style of the town, many of the

new buildings reflect an in
creasing awareness among lo
cal residents of the significance
of its historical atmosphere. As
long as the people of Imai-cho
continue to value the classic
beauty of the view that awaits
them just outside the doorstep
each morning, this town will
remain a very special place.
Imai-cho is just one of
many places that I have visited
in Japan, but the one that has
had the most profound effect
me. Many Japanese, as do
many Americans, spent their
lives with mysteries. We are
embedded in, and look out on,
a universe that is as mysterious
as it is vast, and if that weren't
mystery enough, we have our
own personal mysteries: Who
am I? Where am I? Why am I?

Our reaction to the mys
teries has been twofold: we cre
ate religions, all of which say
in one way or another, "There
is something bigger than I;"
and, in our quest to find our
selves, we establish and support
programs and institutions such
as Study Abroad and Gettys
burg College, where a new gen
eration is taught what we al
ready know, and equipped with
the tools and inspirations to
continue the grand quest. For
many of us, Gettysburg College
is the place where we begin the
grand quest. To my surprise, I
will leave Japan with even more
questions than I had before I
came. Come see for yourself,
bring a friend. The Study
Abroad office is located in the
College Union building, second
floor. I.E. Fletcher


Consider THIS!

Conflict and Consensus

I can't help it if people
are stupid. My job is sim
ply to inform the campus
community of the actions of
their peers. And I must say
that I have had an excellent
time doing just that.
I have served as Edi
tor-in-Chief of this fine stu
dent newspaper for three
semesters, and adventures
have abounded.
The first issue that I
was in charge of was printed
out of my apartment in
Apple. We had been
flooded out of our office in
Plank Gym and had to move
most of our equipment to
my dining room. That
should have been my first
clue about what I was get
ting myself into.

Less than two months
later, the Gettysburgian was
the first newspaper in the
country to cover the death
of the Brian Peterson baby.
On a hunch, we contacted
the Review at the University
of Delaware and unknow
ingly stumbled upon one of
the biggest news stories of

1996. Through out the year,
the 'Burgian battled college
policies in our Opinions

pages; covered everything
from outsourcing to squirrel
attacks in the news; brought
you the best in Bullets sports
coverage; and entertained with
numerous interesting features.
We changed our style of
layout, increased our coverage,
our subscriptions and our ad
vertising—all while celebrating
our 100th anniversary. We
learned a great deal-and had
even more fun—at national
conferences. We were recently
awarded tops honors in the
world of student journalism
we are finalists for the presti
gious Pacemaker Award.
But enough memories.
As Editor, I have often had to
hide my true opinions in the
interest of the newspaper. The
truth is, the Gettysburgian is
one of the best college news
papers in the country, and any
one who thinks differently is
an ignoramus. We strive for
fairness and have never, never
knowingly gotten a story


wrong.
I am proud to be an
American where the press is
free. Without a scrutinizing,
analytical media, democracy
cannot exist. The first amend
ment is arguably the most im
portant part of our great Con¬

stitution. The fourth estate is
an unofficial check on the bal
ance of all power in this nation
and on this campus.
I am not sorry for any
thing that I have done over the
past year and a half. Sure there
are some things I would change
if I had it all to do over again.
Over all, I am proud of the
Gettysburgian, its history, and
most of all its people. It is com
monly believed that reporters
constitute their own kind of fra
ternity, forming close bonds of
friendship between those who
cherish truth and cynicism. The
reporters, editors, visitors and
staff of the Gettysburgian are
some of the best people I have
met on campus. The love and
respect that I have for these
people can not be measured.
Despite the numerous times
that they have been fired, they
all continue to give every effort
possible-an admirable trait that
weekly inspires me.

I will miss the Gettysburg
ian, but I know that it is time
for someone new to take the
reigns, continue to improve the
paper and make her own mark
on the newspaper and the col
lege. Rebecca K. Babbitt


Consider this...

In the spirit of the up
:oming holidays the staff at the
_Gettysburgian would like to
>resent its Christmas list for
:veryone_'s consideration.
1) Dental dams. Why is
t that AIDS is the disease which
iffects everyone, and does not
liscriminate, yet, through the
h'
stribution of condoms only,
ve discriminate against a por
ion of the population which
:annot possibly use them? It
eveals an underlying ho
nophobia on this campus.
2) Less apathy. Thiscam
>us has too many complainers

ind not enough people of ac
ion. Do more than whine,
how some pride in your col
ege and yourself.
3) An effective and re
ponsive administration.
_fhink before you act. Stop hir
ng consultants. Stop out
ourcing our problems. Listen
o the students, it's our college.
4) Reporters, Photogra
> hers, and Writers. We here
vork very hard, and we know
here are many others who
lave the talent to be here_,
'lease join us in the production
)f your newspaper.

5) Communication. We
11 can communicate we just
on't seem to do it very well_,
ake a little time and let some¬

one, hell, everyone what you
are thinking! For example, the
recent proposed changes in the
sexual assault policy are cen
tered around communication.
Perhaps if we all communicated
better in the first place, such a
policy wouldn't even be neces
sary. 6) We want our goat
back. 7) Lower tuition. We re
alize this would take a miracle
on North Washington Street,
but it's Christmas so we might
as well ask, you never know.
8) A tenure process that
makes sense to the students and
the faculty. Enough said.
9) A rematch in the chair

races. 10) Maturity. There is
more to social life than drink
ing and fraternity parties, and
there are so many people you
haven't met yet.
11) Safe and Happy Holi
days for the entire campus
community. And as a special
note, to all the support staff on
this campus, those who clean
up after us, feed us, and help
the college to function every
day, and so often go unrecog
nized, you are appreciated.
12) And a partridge in a
pear tree.

Conflict and Consensus —
The Pachyderm's Pulpit

In 1988 DanQuaylewas
elected Vice President of the
United States. This should have
been a moment of triumph for
the 41 one year old Vice Presi
dent-elect, however disap
pointment must have befallen
Mr. Quayle. His selection as
then Vice President George
Bush's running-mate was hit
with criticism, his campaign
was a severe disappointment
and in the sole Vice Presiden
tial Debate, the Democratic
Vice Presidential Nominee,
Senator Lloyd Bentson won the
debate with a single line
pointed towards Dan Quayle,
"You are no Jack Kennedy." This
was only the beginning for the
nations 43rd Vice President as
the media was relentless in pub
licly shredding him, he became
the biggest target for comedi
ans looking for a laugh and
gaffe after eaffe befell him.

Oh Danny boy
by John Dunlap
Staff Writer

Four years later President
Bush and Vice President
Quayle were gone the Demo¬

cratic Ticket of then Governor
Bill Clinton and Senator Al
Gore came out on top, but the
outgoing Vice President must
have been happy, happy that he
had begun to repair his reputa
tion. Unlike 1988 when he was
not focused, in 1992 Vice Presi
dent Quayle ran a great cam
paign, one of the few bright
spots in the lackluster Bush
campaign. Unlike 1988 when
Senator Bentson got the best of
him, in 92 the Vice President
went after his opponent Sena
tor Gore and came off well.

With his attack of television
character, "Murphy Brown" for
glamorizing illegitimacy Dan
Quayle started a national de
bate that continues to this day.
His attack of the CBS television
program was mocked and
made fun of at first but by 1994
even President Clinton admit
ted along with most of the lib
eral media that had trashed
Quayle that yes, "Dan Quayle
was right."
His attack of illegitimacy
and his calls for a renewal of
family values won him strong

support among conservative
Republicans. His support of
life and issues that are impor
tant to the family have made
him a favorite among Christian
Conservatives. Today Dan
Quayle is a favorite campaigner
for Republicans running for
public office. The former Vice
President has been on the
stump campaigning with mod
erate Republican Governor
Christine Todd Whitman of
New Jersey to freshman after
freshman in the historic Repub
lican Congressional Class of
1994. He has written two
books and is putting together
a national organization. All
signs are pointing to a run for
the White House himself.
The allegations that Dan
Quayle is not intelligent are stu
pid comments themselves. He
is a great politician who was
able to win a U.S. House Seat

at the age of 29 and four years
after that in 1980, he defeated
longtime Indiana Senator Birch
Bayh, for Senator Bayh's Sen
ate seat. As Vice President his
work with the Competitiveness

Council was viewed positively.
There he fought big govern
ment and the regulations that
punish business. On the Space
Council he was given credit for
helping to restrengthen and
reenergize NASA and his calls
for tort reform and being
headed by the Republican Con
gress. Finally, unlike most poli
ticians, including the current
incumbent President, Dan
Quayle speaks his mind, and
when he does he says what
means and means what he says.
Dan Quayle is a politician
of conviction. In his first race
for Congress two issues that he
campaigned on were term-lim
its and the flat tax, both, espe
cially the latter will big issues
in 2000. Along with his wife,
Marilyn who is his strongest
advisor, and is pretty outspo
ken herself, the Quayles have
been in two national cam¬

paigns, they know what their
like and if they decide to give
2000 a try then Dan Quayle
should go beyond the expecta
tions that the media and the
political pundits will set for

him. If Dan Quayle wants to
remain in politics than he has
to run for President the next go
around. You can stay out of the
political game to long or else
you will be forgotten and the
Quayles know that but they
will strong competition. Some
of the former Vice Presidents
possible competitors include
the 1996 GOP Vice Presiden
tial Nominee, Jack Kemp, the
wife of the man on the top of
the 1996 Republican Ticket,
the President of the American
Red Cross, Elizabeth Dole, and
the son of the man who chose
him to be in the national spot
light and supported him while
he was there, Texas Governor
George W Bush. Beyond those
facing his numerous Republi
can opponents looms Vice
President Al Gore, the Demo
cratic front-runner, and I am
sure that Dan Quayle would
love to get a little revenge for

1992



To the Editor:

Some of our . favorite
things to complain about here
at Gettysburg are the apathetic
students, the uncooperative
administration, and the un
friendly community. AIDS
Awareness Week 1997 has
proven all of us who com
plained wonderfully wrong.
The following community part
ners, administrative and aca
demic departments and student
organizations gave their money,
time, support, and hard work
to make this week of AIDS
Awareness one of the "biggest

things to happen on campus in
a long time," in the words of
one administrator. Those
sponsors include:
The Center for Public
Service, The Office of College
Life, the Chaplain's Office and
the Chapel Council, the Get
tysburg Hospital, the Health
Center, Adams County AIDS
Community Resource Pro
gram, Allies, Student Senate,
Alumni Relations Office, the
Susquehanna Valley Names
Project, the Office of the Dean
of the College, the Office of the

President, Rotoract, ACTUP,
Adams County Family Plan
ning, Alpha Phi Omega, Greek
Organizations, CHEERS, the
Religion Department, the Phi
losophy Department, Global
Studies, Latin American Stud
ies, African-American Studies,
Women's Studies, the Women's
Center, the Biology Depart
ment, Residential College,
Residential College, Residential
Life, Office of Student Activi
ties, Greek Life, Counseling
Services, SAC, Bacchus, The

HIV Testing Support Network,
Walmart, and Kennie's Market.
Much thanks to those or
ganizations, and a special thank
you to the following members

McClelland, Judy Alder, Bill
Gohl, Connie Songer, and Su¬

san Butcher.
This week could not have
happened without the support
and help of every person who
made a contribution or with
out the student, faculty, staff,
and administrative support and
energy which made this week
a great success. Much thanks
to all of you.

Once upon a time long ago, a bridge
collapsed. The date was November
7, 1940, and the bridge was the
Tacoma Narrows Bridge. This
spectacular collapse was captured on
film, and resonance is frequently and
conveniently blamed for the disaster.
But what really happened on that
fateful day? What was the real
culprit? In this talk, we will take a
closer look at the fascinating story of
the Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse
and the ensuing controversy over its
cause. ALL STUDENTS AND

The Gettysburg College
Men's Basketball team has
started out with a sizzling 4-0
record. The team is led by se
nior Co-Captains Terry

The Bullets will look to several
returning players to make large
contributions this year includ

and Sophomore Ryan Napp.
Transfers Jon Bowman
and Bill Davidson, a junior and
sophomore, respectively, along
with sophomore Kevin Tonkins

close in the second half Pfiel
caught on fire scoring 13 of his
16. The Bullets played tanta
lizing defense to spark a big run
in the second half. While
Kueka was never in the game
the Bullets executed on offense
making several back-door cuts
that keyed dunks from Pfiel
and Tonkins.
In the Championship
Game the Bullets took on
Concordia College(IlL) The
Bullets were led by excellent
guard play by Bowman and
Napp each scoring 12. While
Kevin Tonkins dominated the
boards both offensively and
defensively with 13. The game
was back and forth but the Bul
lets played strong down the
stretch to clinch the title. Ryan
Napp was the MVP of the tour
nament while Tonkins and Pfiel
won All-Tournament Team
honors.

On Tuesday November
25, the Bullets battled a hard
nosed Messiah team to a 66
57 win. Messiah got on top by
10 early in the game. The tough
Gettysburg defense sparked the
offense as the Bullets fought
back with a series of backdoor
cuts and three point goals. Tied
at the half the Bullets fell be
hind again with 12 minutes left
to play in the game.
Again tough defense and

Bullets took control of the
game and won by 9.
On December 1 the Bul
lets returned from a happy holi
day to travel to York College.
The Bullets won the game be
fore a hostile crowd of 525,70
65. The Bullets offense came
out of the blocks fast with
points from Rothenberger,
Napp, and Tonkins.
York fought back and tied
the Bullets through halftime.
In the second half the Bullets
led by strong defensive efforts
of Napp and Davidson opened
up a lead. Tonkins who led all
Gettysburg Scorers with 20
paved the way on offense.

Davidson's solid play and
rebounding helped the bullets
down the stretch run. In the
closing seconds of the game up
by two, Jon Bowman came up
with a big steal to seal the vic
tory. After 4 games Napp leads
the Bullets averaging 15.8
points per game. Tonkins is
close behind with 12 followed
by Pfiel with 9.5. Davidson is
the leading rebounder with 7.5

per game but Tonkins follows
close behind pulling down 7.3
per game. Napp also leads the
team from the three-point
stripe shooting 41%. Napp
made the Centennial Confer
ence Honor Roll for the week
for his role in the Messiah
game. Through three games
Napp was the eighth leading
scorer in the Conference. Bow
man was second in the Confer
ence with a 66.7 field goal per
centage. Napp was ninth in

The Bullets dominate the
Conference in blocked shots

Tonkins(9). Tonkins is second
in the Conference in steals with
3.33 per game. Coach Dave

From Gettysburg Sports Release
Saddled with just a 3-3
record six games into the 1997
campaign, the Gettysburg Col
lege men's soccer team went on
a 15-game unbeaten streak that
not only landed the Bullets in
the NCAA Division HI playoffs
but carried them all the way to
the quarterfinals.
The 15-game unbeaten
streak, which included a pair of
ties , was just one of many
school records established dur
ing the season. The Bullets
broke the team record for goals
in a season by scoring 69 times.
The former mark of 62 was set
in 1995.
The 2-0 loss to New Jer
sey, in .the Division II
quarterfinals also brought an
end to the redord setting career
of Greg Stevcic. Stevcic was the
Bullets second-leading scorer in
1997 with 12 goals and 15 as¬

sists. Stevcic will leave Gettys
burg with the following
records: goals in a career (45),

goals in a season (21 in 1995),
assists in a career (33), assists
in a season (15), points in a
career (123) and points in a
season (49 in 1995). Kind of
impressive.
The Bullets' leading
scorer this season was stellar
sophomore forward Chris
Pryor. He supplied Head
Coach Dave Wright's squad
with 17 goals and seven assists.
Pryor's goal total was the sec
ond highest in school history.
In addition, to this feat, he

matched th,e school record for
assists in a game by assisting
three goals in the 5-0 victory
over Washington.
Senior midfielder Brian
Hill and sophomore forward
Jason Vishio each accounted
for seven of the Bullets 69
scores. Hill had seven assists
to go along with his seven
goals, while Vishio was cred
ited with four assists.
The leading scorer
among freshmen was
midfielder Jeremy Shapiro. In
his first season at Gettysburg,

Sophomore goals leader Chris Pryor tries to toss the ball downfield to one of his teammates.

Shapiro tickled the twine with
four goals and also tallied three
assists.
Junior goalie John
Katerba is on the verge of es
tablishing a new school record

for shutouts. He had seven
shutouts in 1997, boosting his
career total to 17. The record
of 18 is held by both Mike
Battagha and Tom Ashworth.
Katerba benefitted from

the best defense around in
three solid starters. Playing all
22 games for the Bullets were
backs senior Matt Kelly, junior
Josh Rubinich, and junior Jim
Green.

What a life? That is not
even the best part. Sometimes
you get to go to a sports event
for free. Even then, all you have
to do is stand on the sideline
with a microphone and tell the
awaiting fans at home the prog
nosis on Big Bubba Johnson's
ankle sprain. Oh yeah, and you
get paid to do this_,too
The best benefit however
is the women, or men, depend
ing on the gender of the sports
caster. Have you ever seen how
the women flock to ESPN's
Chris Berman, or Stewart
Scott? And Willow Bay, from
the "NBA Inside Stuff," has
men falling at her feet. Amaz
ing, simply amazing.

Have you ever watched
ESPN? Many people who are
involved with sports have.
They have this great show
called "Sportcenter," in which
these tremendously funny com
mentators present the high
lights and lowlights from the
latest sports action.
Well, this Christmas I am
writing a letter to the North
Pole, and I am gonna ask good
ol' Santa for just one thing. For
one day, I would like to be an
announcer on ESPN. I want to
make up my own script for
when Kobe Bryant jams right
in Patrick Ewing's face. I want
to be a part of the action.
How cool would that be?

unique blend of seasoned
veterans and talented
newcomers. Under the
tutelage of new coach Troy

acquired a record of 2-3 at
this point in the season.

Binnall, Scarpato, Beck,

bit of revenge for the Bullets

After this tn-meet the Bullets

for one of the most
competitive tournaments they

greater than that? Kicked back
in a lazy boy, with popcorn in

Just once, I would like to
be Stuart Scott and say, "John

sounds great. Or maybe I could
be ESPN's own Dick Vitale_,
and just scream at random into
a microphone, "He's a daiper

dandy baby, he's a high-riser,
he's awesome with a capital A."
I would do that for free.
Just give me a meal, a roof over
my head, and let me go to
town. So not only do they get
to watch all the sports high
lights they want; get to meet
interesting professional ath

also get "mad duckets" for do

That would make all my

Trustees allot $50,000 for social events

by Daniel Larkin
News Editor
The Gettysburg College Board of
Trustees has alloted $50,000 to fund
social events for the 1998 spring semes
ter. President Haaland and Dean
Ramsey announced this at the January
19 Student Senate meeting.
The new funding was the result
of a meeting the trustees had with a
group of six students at the end of last
semester about social life on campus.
Val Katzmar, one of the six stu
dents, said that the group was "pretty
blunt," in addressing the board.

Katzmar said that the students told the
trustees that social life on campus has
been suffering over the last two years.
Katzmar said that the restrictions the
current BYOB policy places on frater
nity parties has created a lack of social
outlets on campus.
Katzmar, a member of senate's
Social Life Commitee, said the students
asked the trustees for a possible bar or
dance club on campus. According to
Katzmar, President Haaland responded
by asking what the students would do
if they were given money to fund social
events.
The group of six students
(Katzmar, Becca O'Connell, Mark

Astrom, Jen Gillete, Rodwin Lowe, and
Marcelo Ardon) were chosen to be rep
resentative of diverse aspects of
Gettysburg life, including Greeks, Non
Greeks, Student Government, and mi
nority students.
These six students now compr ise
an ADHOC committee formed for the
purpose of administering the $50,000
to student groups interested in putting
on ad-campus social functions.
According to Katzmar money will
be granted to student organizations re
questing to hold all-campus social
events. The adminstration of these
funds will be handled completely by the
student committee.

Katzmar said that only three cri
teria are necessary for receiving these
funds: the event must be an all-campus
event, it must follow the BYOB guide
lines, and the committee will need all
receipts.
Katzmar urged students to "take
advantage of this large amount of
money," noting that another popular
campus event, the Snow Ball costs
about $3000.
Student groups wishing to gain
access to these funds will be able to ap
proach the committee in the coming
weeks. Katzmar said that there are al
ready "lots of good ideas in the works.'

Student vehicles vandalized during Winter Break

by Laura Root
Staff Reporter Eight cars were found vandalized
in the Bream/Wright/Hauser and Sta
dium parking lots on January 6. In each
vehicle, windows were broken. Some
car owners also reported stolen items
to the Borough Police. This makes the
crime not only vandalism but larceny.
Gettysburg College Safety and
Security responded to the situation right
away. The vandalized vehicles were
towed to a compound for safe-keeping,
and their owners were informed of the
situation. Unfortunately, most car
owners were not were not accessible
due to participation in Gettysburg
sports activities.
Gettysburg College has agreed to
pay for the broken windows. Car own
ers with missing items are in contact
with their insurance companies to help
pay for those damages.

Safety and Security does not yet
have any indication of who might have
committed the crime. Because the van
dalism occurred over the Winter Break.
Nor do they also do not know exactly
when the crime took place.
To prevent this from happening
again, Safety and Security is increasing
their patrol of all parking lots. There
is also a possibility of cameras being in
stalled in order to monitor probelm ar
eas more effectively also exists. Sergeant
Witt, a member of the Safety and Secu
rity team, also suggested taking the fol
lowing precautions in the future:
-report all suspicious activities to
Campus Security
-store valuables in the trunk
instead of in plain view
-keep doors locked/ keeping
windows up
-park in a well-lit area

/ want my cable TV

by Ann Marie Bielli
Staff Reporter Gettysburg College students
now have 36 new sources of pro
crastination. To many a
student's delight, 36 new cable
channels are now available for
viewing throughout most of the
College campus.
Previously students had 40
channels to browse through, but
now, due to recent changes, stu
dents can choose from 70 six chan
nels. This surprising but pleasant
change is due to the fact that
Gettysburg College's cable com
pany, GS Communications, has
changed, to a broader base through
out Adams County. Conse¬

quently, students at Gettysburg art
able to receive this benefit as well,
What makes this change sc
enjoyable is the fact that these ad
ditional channels do not cosi
Gettysburg College students a
single dime. Donald Kingston,
Director of Telecommunications
Information Resources, said the
College chose to go along with the
broader channel programming be
cause they "wanted to make the
channels available for students."
Some of the new and excit
ing channels now available for the
viewing pleasure of Gettysburg
College students include Home
Team Sports, TV Food Network,
VH-1, ESPN-2, Cartoon Net
work, Comedy Central, E!, The

Tom and Joan Norris, members of the
Class of 1960, will contribute / _s%
$50,000 this year if 40% of _^A/nrrj*
Gettysburg's alumni contribute to the / 1 / _^
Annual Fund by June 30,1998. This K_^ _/ _^ALUMNI
year, the Annual Fund's goal is $2.01 CHALLENGE
million. These dollars are used to
support financial aid, faculty salaries,
equipment purchases, student organizations, and much more.
Here's how we're doing as of December 31, 1997:

Learning Channel, The History
Channel, and ESPNews.
Kingston is also working
with a contractor and GS Commu
nications to install new fiber optic
cables from East Lincoln Avenue
near Paxton Hall to Pennsylvania
Hall. These new cables will enable
Channels 4 and 5, the Gettysburg
College television channels, to be
received at Crow, Edwards House,

past, these building have not
been able to receive the College

On February 14, GCTV

The only major problem

that some students must repro

Views from the outside

by Cara Masucci
Staff Writer Starting college is an ex
perience many people say they
will never forget. First year stu
dents are constantly bom
barded with advice. Older stu
dents describe what to expect
and the activities taking place
on campus, your parents tell
you that you need to balance
your social plans with studying,
and everyone warns you to es
tablish a good relationship with
your roommate. These are
some standard topics of discus
sion that a typical freshman is
likely to engage in.
However, one issue is of
ten left out: how it feels to go
back to where you came from.

Free:
6 months

Going back home is a unique
experience for everyone, and
visiting your old high school
can seem especially odd. Many
first year students return to
their high schools for the first
time over the winter break.
Talking to students, most
everyone seems to agree that
seeing the friends they left be
hind and visiting their favorite
teachers are the main reason
they went back to their old high
school.
For Anne Corrigan, a
freshman from Lancaster, PA,
the experience, was no differ
ent. Having left some of her
closest friends behind, who
were a year younger, she was
happy to return.
People had different reac
tions to her appearance at her
former school. Sometimes she
says she was looked at strangely
as people wondered what she
was doing there, but as soon as

people got over the initial
shock, they were really excited
to see her.
One of Anne's favorite
teachers sat her down and
made her relate every aspect of
her life at college. The teacher
even called her by the nick
name she had given Anne
when she taught her in class.
With the new addition
that had just been added to the
school, Anne felt a little over
whelmed at first. "One of my
friends had to show me
around!" she exclaimed. For
tunately, though, she was able
to see everyone and everything
she had hoped to see.

For many sophomores,
juniors, and seniors, high
school is a distant, fading
memory. When speaking of
"last year," they are no longer
referring to a time before col
lege. Many students have, by
this time, grown away from
things connecting them to their
hometowns and high schools.
College friendships replace
high school buddies, distance
separates high school sweet

^¦^¦^^ _J Why, you

one want to go
back to high school? Cliques,
homeroom, bells, detention,
gym class—what's the point?
There are many reasons, vary
ing from person to person and
changing as time goes on.
Though some upperclassmen
continue to visit their high
schools, first year college stu-

j[jr P er '
_^^^ _~"_~"_^^^_r tinent
an expla
nation is
the fact that many students sim
ply do not want to return to
high school, even for a visit.
They served their time and are
now free.
Though these circum
stances may apply to a major
ity of college students, at least
a select few exist who actually
do return to their high schools
throughout their college ca
reers. Junior Maureen Miller
says, "I really enjoy going back
to see my old teachers, espe
cially the ones that influenced

me." She revealed that she
loves her high school and that
when she shares with teachers
how their classes have helped
her it "makes their day and
shows them their work is
worthwhile."
Miller had a positive high
school experience, both while
in school and after she gradu
ated, and this is what motivates
her to want to return. For
those students who had more
negative experiences in high
school, however, there is little
or no desire to return. Miller
noted that it was really only the
top two percent of her class
that returned to visit after their
freshman year in college.
Sophomore Heather
Brown has been back to her

Free:
2 years

high school only once since she
has been at Gettysburg. She
had told her friends from home
she would never return to high
school, but she decided to visit
a favorite teacher and a guid
ance counselor. "It was weird,"
comments Brown. "It was small
and I realized I had outgrown
it." The visit itself was a bit
uncomfortable because every
one wanted to know what she
was planning on doing with her
life, a question she was not
ready to answer at the time.
When asked why she has
not gone back since, Brown
pointed out that she "has no
reason to."

right track. He has an execu
tive position, his father is re
marrying, and Tommy's going

to have a brother. Holy
Schnikes! Things couldn't be
better. But then everything takes
a turn for the worse. After Big
Tom's sudden death, Tommy
has to take over his dad'b sale
route with only his dad's smug
assistant, Richard (Spade) to
guide him.
Wacky adventures ensue
as Tommy and Richard try to
sell brake pads before the bank
forecloses on Callahan Auto
and his evil stepbrother and
stepmother (Rob Lowe and Bo
Derek) take over what's left of
the family fortune.
Lowe shines as Tommy's
menacing stepbrother, Paul.
Lowe has gone from playing

the heartthrob of such Brat
Pack films as St. Elmo's Fire
andT/;e Outsiders to playing
the villain in Wayne's World
and Tommy Boy. Lowe, how
ever, is a villain subject to con
stant mockery and ridicule
from the movie's heroes.
Another face to look for
is SNL alum Dan Akroyd, who
plays a small role as an auto
parts tycoon interested in buy
ing out Callahan Auto.
Both Farley and Spade
are at their funniest in this film.
These two comedians comple
ment each other with their in
dividual styles. They are polar
opposites: Spade with his dry,
sarcastic humor, and Farley
with his lovable buffoonery and

physical comedy.
Farley and Spade offer a
fresh look at traditional com
edy teams like Abbott and
Costello and Laurel and Hardy
Both Farley and Spade make
the jump to the big screen with
ease. Like Mike Myers, Dana
Carvey, and Adam Sandier,
Farley and Spade have made
several movies with other SNL
stars like Chris Rock, Dan
Akroyd, and Will Ferrell.
Farley will be best re
membered as the bumbling but
well-meaning slob. This is a
role he reprises in Black Sheep
as Mike Donnelly, the brother
of a political candidate. Mike
does more harm than good in
his attempt to help his brother's

campaign, so Spade is sent to
keep him out of the way. The
chemistry between Spade and
Farley makes Black Sheep a hit
as well.
Farley once more plays
the lovable buffoon as "the
great white ninja" in Beverly
Hills Ninja.
Farley followed the foot
steps of his larger-than-life idol
John Belushi. Like Belushi, his
untimely death has been la
mented, for it will be a long
time coming before the world
sees a fresh comedic face like
Farley's.

Good Will Hunting Is

by Mike Petro and Dan Larkin
Op/Ed and News Editors
Before we begin, our hats
go off to the Majestic theater
for finally installing some de¬

cent seats. Glad to see where
that three dollars I paid for a
soda is going. However, this is
not the only reason to go and
see Good Will Hunting.
The story of Hunting at
first glance is quite simple. Will
Hunting, a troubled youth
from South Boston holding
down a job as a janitor at MIT
divides his time between drink
ing, fighting, and higher math¬

ematics. One thing leads to
another and his genius is soon
discovered, along with his
troubles. What follows is a
wonderfully written story
about relationships, personal
demons, and how we all must
deal with them.
The fact that this is movie
had been billed as a "wonder
fully written story about rela
tionships, personal demons, and

how we all must deal with
them," worried me at first.
But Good Will Hunting really
impressed me. I was expecting
a sappy romantic drama, but
instead found a thoughtfully
directed and intelligently
scripted film. Sure , it's tragic
and romantic. But it's done in
a realistic, non-melodramatic
way. In addition to an excellent
story, the film is set against a
very colorful background . As
a Massachusetts native, my fa
vorite part was the wonderful

Southie accents heard through
out the movie.
This really is a good
movie. Matt Damon {The
Rainmaker, School Ties, Cour
age Under Fire), the newest
Hollywood find, in the title
role, stars with an excellent
supporting cast including Ben
Affleck {ChasingAmy, Mallrats,
Phantoms) as Chuckie, Robin
Williams {Good Morning Viet
nam, Dead Poet's Society,
Awakenings) as Shawn, and
Minnie Driver {Grosse Point
Blank, Circle of Friends).

All actors turn in believ
able and powerful perfor
mances that draw the viewer in
and make them connect with
the characters. Beyond the per
formances, this is a very well
written movie with a believable
and engaging story.
The acting is really amaz
ing in this movie. It's really

good to see Robin Williams do
ing good movies again. He's a
very good actor, but in the past
couple of years he's been floun
dering in ridiculous family
drivel. fFlubber and Father's
Day spring imediately to mind.)
I don't think I 've liked him this
much in a movie since The
Fisher King. I loved Ben Affleck
in Chasing Amy, and he's even
better here. Matt Damon proves
that's he more than just a pretty
face, with an unbelievable per
formance. His character is the
perfect mix of Southie street
punk and mathematical genius.
All three o f these guys should
be, at least, considered at Os
car time. As the only female
member o f the film 's excellent
cast, Minnie Driver, more than
holds her own as Damon's ro
mantic foil.

Overall, I give this movie
a four and a half out of five
stars. Robin Williams deserves
serious consideration for an
Academy Award, acknowledg
ing his true talent as a dramatic
actor, and the screenplay, co
written by Damon and Affleck
is one of the best to hit the
screen in a long time. In short,
go see this movie.
/ don't see why anyone
wouldn't like Good Will Hunt
ing. In short, it's a wicked good
movie. I give it " fouh out of
five stahs."

Upperclass students stay away

outs. "The teachers are usually
happy to see me," he says.
"They always want to know
what I'm doing when I gradu
ate." The visiting students not
only have similar reasons for
returning, but many also find
the same situation upon their
return: change. The students
filling the ranks in high schools
now are mostly those who were
in middle school when
Gettysburg's classes of '98, '99,
and 2000 walked the halls.
Gardner noted that the
overall style of the students had
changed; "the 'preppy' look of
button-down shirts and khakis
is no longer the norm," as stu
dents wear baggier, more
ragged clothes and hairstyles.
"It looked messy compared to
this school," commented one
sophomore after a visit to her
high school.

Junior Paul Herzer re
turned to his school in Prince
George County, Maryland, to
let his old teachers know that

continued from page 5
his parents had moved to
North Carolina in order to al
low his sister the chance to re
ceive a safe education.
During this visit he dis
covered that the school had
added metal detectors, surveil
lance cameras, and increased
police security. He was also
offered drugs, asked if he had
any to sell, almost had his car
broken into, and almost got
into a fight with a rival gang
that had not forgotten him.
Due to the increasing size
of classes coming through the
middle schools of the nation,
some Gettysburg students re
turned to find their high
schools looking not smaller, but
much larger and completely
unrecognizable due to recent
additions.

One sophomore recalls
having to ask for directions
while visiting her recently en
larged high school. "We had
to deal with the ongoing con
struction, but we never got to
use the new parts of the

school," she says.
Upperclassmen do not go
back to visit their high schools
for many reasons. Some sim
ply have no desire to return to
a place that holds nothing (or
bad memories) for them, while
others do not want to face the
changes or admit to themselves
that they are growing up.
Gardner estimated that
17 people from his hometown
were attending Gettysburg
when he first arrived and does
not recall any of them return
ing to visit the high school.
"High schools don't do
anything to bring back old stu
dents. Mine was a public
school, so they weren't look
ing for money. They don't
need us after we've graduated,"
he commented.

Though high schools may
not encourage graduates to
visit, many find the relation
ships with old friends and
former teachers a strong
enough incentive to return to
their alma mater.

Freshmen return

continued from page 5

time, though, once he got over
his initial shock.
The first time students
return to high school is often a
very enjoyable experience.
People are excited to see some
one who has gotten out, and
the alum feels the pleasure of
being able to laugh at what was
left behind.
However, the more often
a person returns, the less plea
surable it is. The high schoolers
begin to scorn the alum, won
dering what kind of social life

the cool graduate actually
leads. Alums have been kicked
off campuses for being around
too much.
Some students agreed
that certain changes were not
for the better. Several students
who attended high school in
upstate New York were upset
to learn that the administration
in their high schools had taken
a disappointing step in becom
ing much more strict in rules
and regulations.
One school, better

known for high-test scores than
a drug problem, had a dog
brought in to sniff out the stu
dents' lockers for illegal sub¬

nces.
This shows the lack of
trust the administration feels
for the student body. One stu
dent commented, "I'm glad I
got out when I did!" Other
than the tightened security
measures within the school, the
student was glad to see her old
friends.
For most freshmen at
Gettysburg, the experience of
going back to their alma mater
is a positive one. Initially, see
ing friends for the first time in
over four months feels awk
ward, but as time goes on, the
students begin to feel more
comfortable as old ties are
reawakened.
The sentiment was best
expressed by Anne Corrigan,
who said, "I will never forget
the people or the experiences,
because they made me who I
am."

Circumcision, the surgi
cal removal of the foreskin of
the penis, developed into a rou
tine practice in the U.S. in the
twentieth century. The U.S. is
the only Western nation to
practice routine, non-religious
infant circumcision, where
roughly 60 percent of baby
boys are still forced to undergo
this painful surgery, done usu
ally without anesthesia and al
ways without the infant's con
sent. Worldwide, 85 percent

After reading your
John Dunlap's] November
13 column, I thought it
would be of interest to you
and your readers to learn
that the only defeat for the
Goodling dynasty was
Neiman Craley, a graduate
of Gettysburg College, class
of 1950.
While I am certainly
not a fan of Congressman
Goodling_'s, I surely do hope
he wins his expected pri
mary. His probably oppo
nent, Charlie Gerow, repre
sents and is supported by
the most right-wing wing of
your Party and his positions
on Public Education and
Choice should be carefully
examined.

I am also, as an Alum,
disappointed that the Col
lege would have him there
at this time. The prestige
of Gettysburg College in
this area and among the
many District voters will
stand him in good stead

Routine circumcision

and it has definite risks. The

and can be tragic! Circumci
sion also causes a loss of some

Consider this

Safety 8c Security's of
fice on the corner of Washing
on and Stevens Streets acts as
)ur own Legion of Justice, but
:hey are much maligned in our
:ommunity.
As one yells for help,
superman is expected to arrive
n a timely fashion. What
)eople don't realize is that
_Juperman also has to go and
escue countless other students
ill over campus—from fire
darms and lockouts to escort
ng the wary home.
Complaints range from
legligence to sluggishness to
gnorance.
The recent vandalism
_ind larceny to cars over Win
:er Break has brought an ad
litional onslaught of criticism
:o Safety & Security.

Safety & Security does a
fine job in dealing with situa
ions such as lockouts and re
sponding to fire alarms, but
ieems to have a harder time ef
fectively responding to more
serious crimes. They are not a
jolice force, nor do we wish
:hem to be; however, it seems
idd that they did not notice
so many vehicles which were
iamaged in such an obvious
;tate. Is the persecution war
ranted, or is the alleged negli
gence the effect of the aug¬

mented responsibilities from an
increased student population
and extended campus grounds?
But over Winter Break,
there were no students.
Superman never made ce
lebrity guest appearances. Yet
Safety & Security is often called
into situations where they aren't
needed. This overuse of these
services is partly to blame on
overly anxious students whose
problems could be solved by an
other agency.
Furthermore, Safety &
Security's usefulness is question
able in some scenarios in which
anything they could do would be
futile. An example of such a situ
ation would be sexual assault.
This type of a situation il
lustrates the limits of the system
as it stands, since the officers
don't have a "legal leg to stand
on." They do have disciplinary
measures at their disposal, but
these actions are rarely taken.

We are not attempting to
bash Safety & Security. They
provide an invaluable service to
our campus community, and on
many occasions respond quickly
and effectively. They cannot be
everywhere at once.
Safety & Security are not
the police; nor are they members
of the Super Friends. And even
without super powers, they serve
the College community well.

Conflict and Consensus
The Pachyderm's Pulpit True diversity

by John Dunlap
Staff'Witer For at least the moment
it appears as if the President of
the United States will have to
put down his golf clubs, stop
talking about his legacy, and in
stead, deal with a crisis brew
ing in his Administration. A
crisis dealing not only with al
legations of an extra-marital
affair, but allegations concern
ing the possibility that Presi
dent Clinton, along with his
longtime friend, the Chairman
of his 1992-93 Presidential
Transition Team, Vernon Jor
dan, may have influenced and
urged the 23 year old woman
involved in the affair, former
White House Intern Monica
Lewinsky, to lie under oath to
lawyers for Paula Jones the
woman suing the President for
sexual harassment.

Bill Clinton is said to be
outraged, but the source of this
allegation, Monica Lewinsky,
was tape-recorded by one of
her friends, former White
House Staffer Linda Tripp. On
the tape, Lewinsky speaks
about her year and a half rela
tionship with President
Clinton, and how along with
the President, Mr. Jordan urged
her to lie. According to these
same tapes Vernon Jordan was
arranging a new job for Miss
Lewinsky in New York. Linda
Tripp's allegations go even fur
ther, as she informed
Newsweek magazine that Presi
dent Clinton made sexual ad
vances towards another White
House Staffer, Kathleen Willey
in the Oval Office. All of these
combined help the case of Paula

Jones who alleges that then
Governor Clinton sexually ha
rassed her in 1991. The Su
preme Court has ordered Ms.
Jones's case against the Presi
dent to go forward.
The White House is de
nying the charges, and Miss
Lewinsky is standing behind
her affidavit denying the
charges but her lawyer, William
Ginsburg has blasted the Presi
dent if the charges are possibly
true. Whitewater Special Pros
ecutor Kenneth Starr has been
given approval by both the Jus
tice Department and the courts
to look into the matter of the
President urging a cover-up.
Once again I am sure that
the liberals in the press and on
this campus are going to try to

attack the Special Prosecutor
and try to attack those doing
the investigation like they al
ways do to escape blame. This
time there are tapes, and for
once we can perhaps see what
Bill Clinton is really like and
how his White House is run.
Congress should now step in
and take a look at these tapes
and determine what abuse has
really occurred. To those who
attack Kenneth Starr, who was
able to get a conviction against
Bill Clinton's hand-picked suc
cessor as Governor of Arkan
sas, Jim Guy Tucker, could you
please open your eyes and see
that after this many scandals,
indictments, and convictions,
that our President has a prob
lem telling the truth to the
American people.

Now, more than legal
troubles, President Clinton
faces questions of trust and of

leadership. Just a few weeks
ago, we saw the President danc
ing on the beach with his wife,
our First Lady, Hillary Rodham
Clinton. Now we hear stories
of the President committing
adultery while he is President,
with someone just a few years
older than his daughter, and
possibly in the White House.
Bill Clinton would not be the
first President to have commit
ted adultery in the White
House but with the reporting
of it, he should have known
better. Almost six years ago on
60 Minutes , he admitted that
he and his wife had problems
but said they were in the past.
Miss Lewinsky did not start
working for the White House
until December of 1995. If this

is true, then once again Bill
Clinton has broken faith with
people he was elected to serve.
I am not the most moral
of people, anyone who knows
me will tell you that. In fact,
we all make mistakes but Will
iam Jefferson Clinton is the
President of the United States
and today that office is in dis
grace. After Watergate,
Presidents Ford, Carter, and
Reagan were able to give honor
back to the office, but that is
being destroyed. The moral
leadership of the President is
gone, and no longer can small
children look up to the Com
mander-in-Chief. The investi
gation should continue and if
the President broke the law
than perhaps we have had one
scandal too many.

by Jay Spiese
Staff Writer In the spirit of Martin
Luther King Jr. Day, I shall milk
a new sacred cow on campus:
diversity. We have all heard
people whine about the lack of
diversity. Sometimes we are the
guilty party.
Let's be honest with our
selves and others. When we say
"diversity," we really mean race.
There aren't enough blacks
here. There aren't enough
Asians here. Why don't we

have more Jews? Is there a way
we can recruit more Hispanics?
If this is what we believe makes
a place diverse, then we are far
too centered on images.
Diversity is not a matter
of how we look. If we had ev
ery race equally represented on
this campus, the diversity
would not change. True diver
sity comes from the mind. It is
our thoughts and our beliefs
that make us unique. Diversity
on campus is achievable if we
allow these thoughts and beliefs
to be freely expressed.

So then, how does our
campus stand on diversity? We
have vocal groups like ALLIES
who freely express their opin
ions. (Amazingly they do so
with little open mainstream re
sistance as evidenced by the
universal free zone that is Get
tysburg campus. If you aren't
sure what I mean then try to
find a building or office that
does not have one of those tri
angles). We have a number of
groups who should be contro¬

versial but aren't. GECO
spends five hundred dollars to
bring a speaker up from Wash
ington, but has done nothing to
clean up the Tiber area. Our
resident communists (all three
of them) were praised for their
determination to show diver
sity. I've often wondered if the
same license would be given to
a Neo-Fascist party. Were I
pessimistic in nature I would
ascribe it to a sense of apathy,
the "to- hell-with-the-world
I'd-rather-get-drunk" attitude.
Since I started writing

these articles, I have received
far more support than disagree
ment. But most of this is done
privately in whispered tones.
These individuals often don't
want to stand up and say that a
popular movement is wrong.
Many people feel the college
community does not want
them to disagree with politi
cally correct, feel good groups
like ALLIES. And so they act
in secret against the group.
Murmured discontent, tearing
down the triangle stickers, and
slurs I will not mention here.

If we want true diversity
on this campus then we must
be prepared for what that

speaking from all points of the

blacks should be sent back to

What a tangled
WEBBER we weave

by Stephen Jenkins
Sports Editor

Here is a big surprise.
"NBA player arrested for vio
lations stemmining from a rou
tine traffic stop." Wow. You
don't say.
Yes, once again another
National Basketball Association
star, Chris Webber, goes down
the tubes after being charged
with assault, resisting arrest,
possesion of marijuana, driving
while under the influence of
marijuana and five other traf
fic related violations.
Multiple players have
been arrested in the past year
including Philadelphia Seventy
Sixers guard Allen Iverson,
most for some drug realted of
fense. Reportedly, police had to
exceed the forty mile per hour
speed limit to keep up with
Webber's car. When he was
checked, Webber could not
provide license, registration
nor proof of ownership of his
vehicle.

Apparently, Webber was
slow to answer the policeman's
questions and when the officer
reached to open Webber's door
to remove him from the car,
Webber batted his hand away
and proceeded to assualt the
man. Once he was tamed by
pepper spray, Webber was de
tained, and legally charged.
So, once again, the al
ready unexciting NBA has been
dealt a low blow by one of it's
tremendously overpaid em
ployees. Is it because the play
ers are young and immature?
Do they leave college or high
school early just for the multi
million dollar contracts teams
wave in front of them?
Of course. In case you
did not know, Webber is only a
few years our senior, and he
makes more in one year what
most of our parents will ever
see in a lifetime. He is already
making decisions that men of
his age normally would not be
making for some time.

The NBA has nothing in
their drug policy that forbids
the use of marijuana. Hello,
marijuana is illegal. If it is
against the law in the United
States of America, it should
also be illegal in the NBA.
Wait, that would be infringing
upon the rights of the players
to freely express themselves
with a joint. Yeah, good one.
Frankly the NBA, has to
reform its drug policies and
crack down on the more, irre
sponsible actions of the imma
ture players of the National
Basketball Assiociation. I can
see it now, "Hey, Chris Webber
can do it why shouldn't I?"
Well, to say the least
Chris Webber has not made a
decision this bad since he lost
the NCAA title for Michigan,
when by calling a time out that
the team did not have.

Chris Webber was a
young star of the NBA, who
had everything going his way
Why mess it up? Stupidity,
pure and simple.

From Gettysburg Press
Release Through the Gettysburg
men's swimming team's first
four competitions of the 1997
98 campaign, 10 different
swimmers have turned in first
place performances in indi
vidual events.
Senior Pete Casares, was
a double winner in
Gettysburg's convincing 162
25 victory over Ursinus on
January 17, a meet which saw
the Bullets' record improve to

2-0. Casares won the 100yd
freestyle in 49.95 seconds and
the 1000yd freestyle in
10:44.89, and also anchored
the winning 400yd free relay.
Casares was also a part of
200yd free relay at the Frank
lin & Marshall Invitational that
established a new school
record. Casares, along with
first year swimmer David

Men's hoops squad dribbling all over competition

By Paul Redfern
Staff Writer The Gettysburg College
Men's Basketball team beat
conference rival Dickinson 74
72 on Saturday to improve
their overall record to 7-7 and
their Centennial Conference
record to 2-2. After starting
out fast with a 5-0 record the
Bullets hit a skid, losing three
to Muhlenberg, Goucher, and
Navy before leaving for Christ
mas break.
After break the Bullets
opened at home with a tough
84-83 overtime loss to

Elizebethtown. After an im
pressive victory over Mary
Washigton the Bullets dropped
three more to Catholic, Alfred,
and Johns Hopkins.
Dickinson came into
the game unbeaten in the Cen
tennial Conference posting a 3
0 record. They won the Con
ference Championship last year
to earn a berth in the Division
III National Championship
Tournament. The Bullets after
suffering their worse loss of the
season to Johns Hopkins came
into the game very much in
need of a win.

Sophomore forward Rich
Pfeil led the Bullets scoring
while Junior center Matt
Rothenburger led the rebound
ing efforts with a game high of
12. Gettysburg got going early
with offensive scoring behind
their Co-Captain Senior for
ward Terry Schofield.
Dickinson was able to- stay in
the game with 16 first half
points from their Senior center
Nate Brought.
Brought was a force as
both a scorer and a rebounder
in the first half. With Sopho
more forward Bill Davidson out
with an ankle sprain Freshman
Mike Monroe stepped up for
the Bullets and provided some
depth off the bench. Gettys
burg went into the locker room
down 11, 44-33.

In the second half the
bullets came to play. With a mix
of both man and zone defenses
the Bullets were able to take
control of the tempo of the
game. Junior Kevin Carrol hit
some big 3 point field goals
down the stretch for the Bullets.

fense to control Brought inside
and held him to 10 second half
points. The bullets defense
held Dickinson to just 27%
shooting in the second part.
With 4:15 seconds left in the
game Matt Rothenburger hit
an open layup to go up 74-66.
Dickinson fought back

and went down two when
Steve DeArment hit 2 foul
shots. With :00 seconds left
Brought was fouled by Pfeil
and missed the first of two foul
shots to seal the victory, 74-72.

Alpha Xi Delta withdraws from Formal Rush

Right Now

Chapter seeks more effective way to recruit new members

By Laura Root
Staff Reporter The Beta Chi chapter of Alpha Xi
Delta has withdrawn from Formal
Panhellenic Rush this year. Instead, the
chapter will conduct its own informal
rush in February.
The withdrawal was originally
proposed by Alpha Xi Delta National
Headquarters in November.
In past years, Formal Rush has not
been as sucessful as the chapter would
have liked. After the death of Casey
Dunn last semester, the organization
has 18 members.
The Chapter president, Marcie
DePalma stated that "In the past few
years, the numbers have gone down for
every sorority. By doing something dif
ferent, we're trying to rebuild the chap
rer." DePalma also added: "we are not

looking just to increase our numbers;
the quality of women we want to re
cruit is very important."
By withdrawing from rush, Alpha
Xi Delta is infact helping the other four
sororities by allowing them take larger
pledge classes, since they can only draw
from the women registered for rush.
Currently, 117 women are going
through rush. "Panhel and the other
sororities have been very supportive,"
said DePalma.
The chapter participated in last
weekend's first round of Formal Rush,
but will not participate in this
weekend's festivities. Instead, it will
offer informal events, including a Pub
lic Relations Week during the first week
of February, a Mocktail Party before the
February 6 Snow Ball, a visit to the Al
pha Xi Delta philanthropy of the
Children's Hospital on February 7, and
a Coffee House on February 8. An in-

rnoio oy _tmiiy tiianeiier
Alpha Xi DeltaSisters chat with Rushees _durinq the first round of parties last Friday.

formation session will be held on Feb
ruary 13. These events are open to all
non-greek females on campus.
"The entire chapter is working
tirelessly to make this work for every
one," said DePalma. "We are incred
ibly excited and very enthusiastic about
rush this year.
Alpha Xi Delta will deliver bids
on Sunday, February 15. The strategy
that Alpha Xi Delta is planning to fol
low is not new. It has been tried in sev
eral sororities at many different colleges
and has been very successful. Next year,
Alpha Xi Delta plans to return to the
formal rush practice after using this new
opportunity to increase its numbers.
"Doing normal rush hasn't been
helping us," DePalma said. She called
the new process "a more relaxed and
informal way to meet rushees. We want
a chance to really get to know these
women in a way that formal rush

doesn't allow."
"In the past, we've brought in
more new members during informal
rush," she said.
Most members of Alpha Xi Delta
feel that the change in rushing policies
is for the better. Tamara King, an Edu
cational Leadership Consultant for Al
pha Xi Delta National Headquarters,
observed that, "A lot of the women rush
ing sororities today are not interested
in the frills and pressures of Formal
Rush."
DePalma commented that "We
have a lot of support from National
Headquarters," and said that Alpha Xi's
alumni "support any effort to help
strengthen the chapter."
The informal festivities will be a
less stressful method to join the sister
hood of Alpha Xi Delta than the more
structured rushes of past years.

The $50,000 Question
Student Life Committee will allocate money for social activities

by Keith Davis
Staff Reporter
Across most of the cam
pus, arguments about the lack
of social activity available have
left fault with the administra
tion. Now, a new opportunity
aimed at strengthening student
activities lies solely in the hands
of the students.
The Student Life Com
mittee will be responsible for
allocating $50,000 in an at
tempt to strengthen and im
prove the current social situa
tion. The committee will have
its first official meeting today
to establish its operating meth
ods and determine how it will
function in the lives of students.
According to Dean
Ramsey, the SLC is intended to
be an experiment that places
more responsibility on students
so they can make the necessary
initiatives to improve social
activities.

"It is clear that because of
BYOB the social life is chang
ing," Ramsey said.
Ramsey further com
mented that the college could
do a better job in providing
more social outlets, especially
to first year students and
sophomores. But the adminis
tration decided that students
needed to be taking the initia
tives and risks involved also.

Consequently, President
Haaland decided to offer
$50,000 to the now forming
SLC. "The idea of this commit
tee is to put this money directly
in the hands of the students,"
Ramsey said. "I want to leave
maximum flexibility to the
[committee]."

Ramsey _8 et are
discussed « We want to help plan! 1 ;^ 7
the moti- r r e s t a t> -
v b a eh. ° n n d s something fantastic " lshed
the "The
money. -Jen Gillette 1 w °
Accord- groups

ing to Ramsey, the money is not
the most important issue.
Ramsey wants people to get out
of the complaining mode.
"This is the time for the
creativity to come forward,"
she said. "If you don't like the
way it is, here is a chance to
change it."
Although SLC is an ex
periment, the outcome is not
considered as important as the
opportunity.
"The real emphasis is on
trying new things and improv
ing social lives, not whether or
not the project fails," Ramsey
said. Dean Ramsey also said
the committee was designed in
order to be independent of

other organizations to avoid
becoming part of the bureau
cratic system. The committee
will be structured but not
enough to hamper the oppor
tunity. The money was not
given to SAC, the current or
ganization offering alternative
activities to the Greek system,
because their schedule and bud-

will compliment each other. We
will have to becareful not to
step on SAC's shoulders,"
Ramsey said. "SAC is and will
continue to be the main pro
grammer of campus activities."
Ramsey expects that the
experiment will end in one of
two ways. The first is if the
committee is unable to estab
lish itself as a popular resource,
SAC could apply for greater
funds. The second option
would be that if the committee
did establish itself as a popular
resource then the administra
tion would examine the possi
bility of continuing the SLC
program. Ramsey encourages
caution however, because she
says the nature of social activ¬

ity needs to be subject to
change. This change would
need to come from constant

innovation.
The SLC is an experiment
currently contained only to the
spring semester. "[President
Haaland] has made no prom
ise that it would be an ongoing
basis," Ramsey said. In regards
to this opportunity, she said, "I
am pretty optimistic."
The six SLC members
were chosen by the administra
tion to discuss problems of so
cial life with the college's trust
ees. The committee formed
from the discussion. The mem
bers represent a wide range of
social organizations on campus.
Member Jen Gillette is
part of the Greek system and is
an RA in a freshman dorm. She
believes the current social at
mosphere is unfair.

"We want to help plan
something fantastic," she said.
Member Rodwin Lowe, a
representative of Christian Fel
lowship and the Black Student
Union, said the SLC exists to
represent the student body.
"It is not our commit
tee, he said. Lowe is not intimi
dated by the amount of money
he and his colleagues will be
allocating.
"Personally for me it is
not a problem."

First African American professor
completes tenure track

College to hold lecture
on ecofeminism

by Daniel Larkin

In December of 1997,
Gettysburg College for the first
time, awarded to tenure to an
African American professor.
Dr. Deborah Barnes of the En
glish department is not only the

first African
American pro
fessor to be
granted tenure,
but the first to be
placed in the
tenure track.
Gettysburg has
in the past
granted tenure
to African pro

"I can't teach the way I
want and do research at

Deborah Barnes,
Professor of English

Concern
ing this mile
stone, Dr. Barnes stated "I feel
honored, but at the same time,
I am shocked that no one has
ever been on the tenure track."
Barnes noted that this
event is one among several
"firsts" in her lifetime. In the
first grade, she was the first to
integrate the school she at
tended. She was the first to re
ceive a doctorate in English in

Barnes was one of seven
professors who were up for
tenure last semester. All were
granted tenure. This was mark
edly different from the fall of
1996, where only one of the

three candidates was awarded
tenure.
When tenure track pro
fessors are reviewed, they are
evaluated based upon three cri
teria: teaching, research, and
governance. Professors in last
year's group of candidates were
denied tenure due to what the
College deemed inad
equate research.
When asked if this sent a
message to this year's group of

research. It really is about the
research."
Barnes stated that she
feels that professors should be
rewarded for innovation and
excellence in classroom teach
ing. Barnes said that she is
grateful that Gettysburg's lack
of a summer session provides
professors with opportunity to
do research. "I can't teach the
way I want to teach and do re
search at the same time," she
said.

Feat u res
hole" lot of individuality

by Cara Masucci and Rebecca
Babbitt
Staff Reporters
At first glance,
Gettysburg College can some
times seem to be a campus of
students who are carbon cop
ies of each other. The J. Crew
look can interfere with a
student's individualism, so
many times students look for
other ways to display their in
dividuality. One way students
express themselves is through
body art. As a somewhat new
trend, body art allows people
to be as discrete or as distinct
as they would like.
When first year student
Eileen Fortune decided to get
tattooed a few months ago, she
and her friends went to Eric
Von Don's Elite Tattooing.
Because of a special affection
for all things Irish and her love
of Celtic art, Fortune decided
to get a Celtic cross on her
ankle. While at the tattoo par
lor, she saw another design that
was of special interest to her: a
water and fire ying-yang, which
she is thinking about getting
tattooed on her shoulder blade.

Fortune said it was a neat
experience because the owner

of the parlor painted the out
side of the building in an intri
cate design himself. She also
said that she was not worried
about infection because every
thing was safe and clean. "You
could actually see them take the
needles out of the package."

For first year student
Mandi Kalbach, the experi
ence was much the same.
Known as an elephant fanatic,
Kalbach decided to have her
passion tattooed "on her leg.
Unlike Fortune, Mandi has had

hers f o r
several
years.
She likes
t h e

b e -
cause it
is very
dis
crete,
but she

is still able to express her indi
viduality nicely.
Many students have
body art done in the beginning
of their first year. Students test
the limits of their indepen
dence from their parents by
getting something pierced or
tattooed.
It is also an interesting
way for the younger first year
students to celebrate their

eighteenth birthdays.
Reactions to piercings
and tattoos vary from parent
to parent. Many students also
use these activities as a form
of rebellion.
The piercing of various
body parts is also quite com¬

mon among college students.
Ear and tongue piercings are the
most popular.
Susannah Kopcho has a
total of 22 piercings, including
a tongue ring. "I knew I wanted
to have one ear covered," said

the first
year stu
dent, a
feat she
achieved by having
17 holes
put in her
right ear.
Kopcho
estimates she has
spent over
$400 on
piercings.

Kopcho. Although
sive piercing does

stand out, "It's not for other
people, [it's] more for myself,"
she said. "Some people think it's
stupid or pointless, but some
people like it," she said.
As for her future plans,
Kopcho said she would "like to
have my lip pierced."
Unlike Kopcho, first year
student Casey Martin didn't
plan his tongue piercing. "It
was spur of the moment," he
said. "Ear piercing is too com
mon, nipple piercing is too
painful. Tongue piercing
sounded interesting," he said.
Martin, who had his
tongue pierced last Saturday, is
still suffering from a swollen
tongue. "The actual piercing
didn't hurt, but afterward there
was a sharp pain," he said.

Martin s tongue piercing
is slightly off-center because of
his webbing-the piece of skin
under the tongue that connects
it to the floor of the mouth.
This was done in order to pierce
the tongue far enough back
where it would not cause dam¬

Last year, a study was
done that found many of our
country's national parks to be
in decline. Many park facili
ties in the U.S. have been forced
to close, parks have had to
shorten their seasons, and
maintenance of historic build
ings have had to be put off un
til funding is available. Visitor
facilities are deteriorating, and
natural and historic park re
sources are being degraded, as
well. Most of these problems

(internships available)

have been caused by lack of
protection from the prevent
able threats that plague the na
tional parks.
For example, there are
clearcuts right up to the edge
of Yellowstone and Olympia
National Parks, and the bison
population at Yellowstone has
been drastically reduced by
capture and slaughter along the
park border. Real estate devel
opment on the boundaries of
Saguaro National Park puts
human activities right at the
park's edge.
The list goes on and on,
including such problems as traf
fic, mining, hazardous materi
als, and grazing. Whether they
originate inside or outside of a
park, the threats are diverse
and complex, and due to these
threats, natural resources in the
national park system are dete
riorating.

Despite the problems
many parks have been having,
they have been attracting more
visitors each year. Our national

parks receive 40 million more
visitors each year than they did
20 years ago, with numbers
expected to increase to over
300 million visitors per year by
1999. Ironically, some parks
are so popular they have traf
fic jams and more air pollution
than the cities people are try
ing to get away from.
Unfortunately, the parks'
budgets have not kept pace
with their visitations. Funding
for the national parks between
1978 and 1996 has actually
decreased, by over $600 mil
lion, making the total budget
$1.4 billion. This may sound
like a large amount of money
but it has not been enough to
keep many of the parks in good
condition.
Hopefully in the near fu
ture, government officials will
realize that our national parks
deserve more attention than

they are presently receiving.
These parks are part of our
heritage, and if we may lose an
important part of our history.

In Case You Missed It
It's still a Scream, baby

by Eileen O'Donnell
Movie Columnist
Writer/director Wes Cra
ven has rekindled interest in the
classic slasher movie with his
1996 film Scream. If you
haven't seen it by now, better
hurry up, because the nineties
are about to leave without you.
The cast of Scream is
filled with today's rising stars,
led by Party of Five star Neve
Campbell. You'll also find fa
miliar faces like Friends star
Courtney Cox, Parenthood's
David Arquette, and even
Henry Winkler (a.k.a. The
Fonz), who has a cameo as the
principal of Woodsboro High.
Sadly, after more than a
decade of gory slasher flicks
like Halloween, A Nightmare
on Elm Street, and Friday the
13th, the genre faded from the
theaters.
Lately, however, it has

been making a comeback be
cause of this revolutionary
motion picture. Scream was a
surprise hit that took both crit
ics and the advertising market
by storm. After its initial run
in late 1996, it was re-released
in the spring of 1997 for a sec
ond run. _^^^^M
Scream relies _^^^^H
heavily on the "for- _^^^^H
mula" of slasher _^^^^H
movies like Hal- _^^_BHI
loween. While _^^m
watching this _^H i
movie, you can _^H I
pick out many _^H '
similarities be- _^^_L
tween it and your _^^_HH
favorite old-school _^^^^H
scary movies. The
film has the unique ability to
bring the audience to the brink
of terror, and then have them
falling out of their seats laugh
ing. It's quite an experience.
The movie opens in typi¬

cal horror movie fashion.
Casey (Drew Barrymore) is
home alone waiting for her
boyfriend when she gets a dis
turbing phone call. This phone
call leads to a bad end for Casey
and her boyfriend, Steve.
_Saetn

is not a movie for the faint of
heart: it opens with gore, and
it doesn't let up until its un
usual ending.
Campbell gives a stun
ning performance as Sydney, a

high school student who finds
that she is the next target of the
serial killer who is terrorizing
Woodsboro, the fictional set
ting of the movie. Sydney also
squares off against tabloid re
porter Gail Weathers (Cox),
author of a tell-all
^^^^_ book about the high
^^^^| profile murder of
_^^^^_h Sydney's mother.
_^^^^_B Like every hor
R ^^^_H ror movie heroine,
_^^M Sydney fends off the
_^H killer with the help
_^H of her best friend,
_^H Tatu m. Rose
_^^H McGowan (of the
¦^^^_J newly-released Phan
^^^^_H toms) plays this part
brilliantly, shining as

the fun-loving friend.
SkeetUlrich (As Good As
It Gets ), who was probably
cloned from a strand of Johnny
Depp's DNA, plays Billy,
Sydney's brooding boyfriend.

His innocence and intentions
are called into question on
more than one occasion.
Sydney's and Billy's char
acters contribute to the dark
ness of the film, while Tatum,
her boyfriend, Stu, and their
friend Randy all add to the
lighter side of the movie.
Scream is truly a fun
movie to watch. The screen
play is hip and original, and it
pokes fun at the whole slasher
genre. The subtle tensions and
ambiguities of the plot will
keep you on the edge of your
seat every time you watch it.
This is perhaps one of the most
definitive movies of our gen
eration.
The popularity of the
movie has already led to one
sequel, with a third movie cur
rently in the works. And to
understand these films, a
knowledge of the original is a
must!

A wannabe good movie

and Mike "Opinionated Spice"

Movie columnists

movie also with extremely low
expectations. In fact, I even
tried to avoid writing a review
for this "film" until a certain
fellow reviewer threatened me
bodily harm if I did not endure
it. In spite of myself, I was
rather amused at parts of Spice
World. The self effacing humor
of the band, at times mocking
their own success and absur
dity of it all, was refreshing to
see. Too many musicians take
themselves way too seriously
(Pearl Jam or Oasis anyone?)
and it was fresh to see a group
that knows their star will fall
faster than it rose. Yet, I must
admit, most of the movie was
a cheesy and contrite concoc
tion of music videos and pre
dictable melodrama.

Dan: Spice World presents
the zany misadventures of a Brit
ish pop group with distinctive
personalities who have taken the
world by storm. Sound famil
iar? Well, if you're looking for a
nineties version of A Hard Day's
Night, I'm sorry to disappoint
you. Spice World stars the ever
popular and always frightening
Spice Girls (Mel C. "Scary Spice"
, Mel B. "Sporty Spice", Victoria
"Posh Spice", Emma "Baby
Spice", and Geri "Ginger Spice")
in their first full-length motion
picture.
The "plot" of this gem in
volves the girls' attempts to have
fun while avoiding an evil tab
loid photographer on the week
leading up to their first live con
cert and the wacky fun they have
along the way.

I went into to see Spice
World with very low expecta
tions. Leave it to the Spice Girls
to surpass them. The movie is
basically a bunch of Spice Girls
music videos strung together by
a really weak story.
Mike: I never had the op
portunity to see A Hard Day's
Night, and I guess that I have a
general disdain for movies about
bands. As a result, I went to this

Spice World's lame at
tempts at self-parody serve to
highlight what might have been
a clever and amusing look at a
bizarre cultural phenomenon.
But the movie instead is much
more interested in serving as a
marketing machine for the
quintet and their music.
Yet, I must also add, even
though this movie is blatant
marketing, it does a slick job
in doing so. Cameo appear
ances and bit parts by the likes
of George Wendt (Norm!),
Elton John, Meatloaf, Elvis
Costello, and Roger Moore all

provide a healthy dose of
chuckles.
/ think my favorite part
of Spice World was the eleven
year old girl sitting behind me
who new every line of the
movie and sang all the songs.
I also wonder who the
film's target audience is sup
posed to be. The show I went
to was packed with preteens,
but some of the film's content
is a bit racy. I also wonder at
the value of a group of women
who preach "girl power" while
prominently displaying their

T&A. Plan 9 From Outer Space
has nothing on Spice World.
This is one of the worst movies
I've seen in my entire life. I
honestly think that everyone
who was in the theater with me
is stupider for having seen it.
No stars (out of five).
This movie is pretty bad.
It left me missing the Monkee's
television show. I'll tell you
what I want, what I really re
ally want: I want this whole
Spice Girls phenomenon to
fade faster than Vanilla Ice's
career. However, for effort and
some original laughs, I give this
a one out of five stars. How
ever, I sincerely hope the man
agement of the Majestic will
have the decency to replace this
film with something more
watchable.

Curtain Call
A month of theater

by Glen Beck
Theater Columnist
Here on the Gettysburg
College campus the month of
February will most certainly
lend itself to the theater. Mark
your calendars for three major
events heading your way.
Next Tuesday, February
3, performance artist Paule
Turner will present two short
pieces in Stevens Lab Theater
at 12 p.m. Don't worry, the
show will be short enough so
that students will not miss their
1:10 classes.
The performance consists
of a twenty minute piece called
Porch Monkey, followed by a
ten minute excerpt from a
longer work entitled She's Out
of Her Time." Discussion may
follow.

On Tuesday, February 10,
the National Theatre of the
Deaf (NTD) will present
Henrik Ibsen's play Peer Gynt.
The play is directed by Will
Rhys, and features dances by
Pilobolus Dance Company, one
of the top dance companies in
the country. The performance
will be at 8 p.m. in the College
Union Building Ballroom.
Tickets are free.
The performance will
feature both American Sign
Language and spoken words.
The company is a professional

acting company made up of
deaf and hearing actors.
The NTD has received
critical acclaim throughout its
30-year history for its adapta
tions of classic literature. The
company has adapted works
by such authors as Chekhov,
Voltaire, Homer, Moliere,
Ibsen, and Puccini. The NTD
also performs original works.
The NTD has collabo
rated with such artists as Chita
Rivera, Jason Robards, Arvin
Brown, Bill Irwin and Peter
Sellars. In 1977, the NTD won
a Tony Award for theatrical
excellence.
Then, on Saturday, Feb
ruary 14, don't forget about
the Pow-Wow. It will start at
11 a.m. And run throughout
the day. Check the publica
tions circulating around cam
pus for further information.

Keep looking out for the
O8cN winter production of
Cotton Patch Gospel, set to
open on Thursday, February
26. Rehearsals are currently
underway. This toe-tapping
version of the Gospel accord
ing to Matthew guarantees a
crowd-pleasing evening.
Come watch your fellow stu
dents act, dance, and sing their
way through a musical you'll
be sure not to forget. More in
formation will follow in the
upcoming weeks.

Cafeteria connoisseur complains of crowds

by LA. Isherwood
Staff Writer As a social critic, my
role on this staff is to provide
a different opinion and new
insight on issues pertaining to
the campus community. That
means, for lack of more elo
quent terms, I bitch about
events or institutions on this
campus which tend to aggra
vate me and others with
whom I have had immediate
contact.
As I walked into our
school cafeteria on Monday
afternoon, I was irked and
annoyed at many of the events
that are all too common in our
beloved Servo. I felt as
though I was going to have
some sort of a nervous break
down. I confided in a group
of friends, and they instructed
me not to vent my frustrations

Disgruntled postal workers

The Post Office Staff is obligated, by
the college, to place all mail that we
receive into your boxes. We do not
appreciate mail being pushed back
through the boxes, onto the floor,
where we then have to pick up the
mess.
Have a little respect, you are adults!
The Post Office Staff

on them, but rather to write
them down for my next column.
So here is a short narrative about
my usual post-weekend experi
ence at Servo.
I walked into Servo and
proceeded to push my way
through the crowded corridor of
indecisiveness and socialization
to "Checkpoint Esther" where I
was greeted by some of the hap
piest faces in the world, the caf
eteria employees who swipe my
card almost daily.
They are always very good
to the students and seem to
know almost everyone by name,
something which, in itself, is
comforting. I was then con
fronted by a large crowd of stu
dents, all pushing for glasses and
trays. I am always amazed at hoe
hard it seems to be for people to
take their glasses with two
hands, place them on a tray, grab
the necessary silverware, and

then depart for the getting of
good eats. For some reason,
this simple procedure is beyond
the dexterity of some people,
leading to dropped glasses and
a floor strewn with silverware.
It is really not that difficult to
get your utensils neatly, but I
understand that some are inca
pable. Next came the great task
of retrieving food. The food
area is always packed with
people who are often way too
aggressive. It is almost like run
ning a gauntlet to be fed in the
corridor of death as a pack of
hungry wolves seeks its chicken
nuggets and curly fries. Daily
I am almost run over by some
one who is not watching where
he (or she) is going, but talk
ing to a buddy who is also
clumsily running into people.
Then, as I tried to get a ham
burger, I saw a flock of four

_ITs

women talking about the week
end and hookups and the like
and preventing people like me
and the others behind me en
trance to the soup and salad
bar. Honestly, I didn't really
care about anyone's social life,
and all I wanted was a cup of
soup to nurse my sore throat.
Then, I had to once again cross
the gauntlet to the drink area
where there was a huge line
that for some reason didn't
move at all. I went back to my
table really annoyed and tried
to confide this in my friends all
of whom had the same exasper
ating experience. All of us were
too tired, from fighting and
starvation, to attempt to go
through the same ordeal again
just for some more food.

The moral of the story
comes in three helpful hints to
you, the campus community
First, please try to be a little

more tidy inside of Servo. We
all have to eat there and silver
ware strewn about, broken
glasses, and colliding people
don't speak well for an institu
tion of higher learning. Sec
ond, the middle of the food
court is no place for extended
conversations. In fact, it is a
really annoying practice to
those of us who go to Servo to
eat. Please, try to save the con
versations for you tables. And
finally, the drink lines need to
be more efficient, and they can
be if people would decide what
they wanted ahead of time and
possibly learn to fill two glasses
at a time. With people waiting
behind you, it is a little rude to
stand in front of the drink ma
chines for several minutes.

Anyway, those are just my
little complaints and sugges
tions for a better, brighter Get
tysburg College.





The Pachyderm's Pulpit

Al Gore, President sooner than we think?

by John Dunlap
Staff Writer When President Bill
Clinton gave his State of the
Union Address, he spoke as
though no scandal had hit his
administration. The atmo
sphere of the Chief Executive's
speech to Congress, was how
ever, much different. Ameri
cans tuned in not to hear what
his plans for the economy or
education are, but to see the
President in crisis, in the middle
of a media feeding frenzy.
A little over a week ago,
the President expected his State
of the Union Address to be a
triumphant moment. He was
going to be the first President
in 29 years to be able to an
nounce that the budget is bal
anced. With, the new budget
surplus, Bill Clinton had hoped
to make saving Social Security

the big issue of the day. Now
the issue of the day remains
whether or not he took advan
tage of Presidential aides, in a
sexual nature, committed per
jury and/or suborned perjury,
and to what extent has he lied
to the American people. We
now know that he lied in 1992
when he was campaigning for
the New Hampshire Primary
about his affair with Gennifer
Flowers. The President not
only owes the American people
an apology, he owes Miss Flow
ers an apology.
There seems to be no
doubt now that the President
is dragging the honor of the
office of the President of the
United States down. He is the
President of the United States
and he has a responsibility to
uphold the honor and integrity
of the White House. He is fail
ing in that duty. Bill Clinton

could survive this scandal like
he has numerous others:
Whitewater, Troopergate,
Travelgate, Filegate, and the
campaign fundraising scandal,
but now he is left with the Paula
Jones sexual harassment law
suit and allegations of sex in the
White House, and perjury. This
scandal has breached the inner
circle and the President's moral
authority is under attack.
Even if the most severe
allegations are true, impeach
ment seems unlikely. However,
if Paula Jones's lawsuit contin
ues than 1998 could turn into
another 1974 where the presi
dent lost control of the coun
try. President Richard Nixon
lost the moral authority to lead
and his domestic agenda died,
and his foreign policy was
slowed. Watergate consumed
his time and even after he re
signed the new President,
Gerald Ford, took command of

a much weaker presidency.
Congress was empowered and
the Democrats were able to
make huge gains in the Con
gressional midterm elections.
This is what Bill Clinton must
avoid. Open talk about resigna
tion is dangerous and it is a sign
that the President is in crisis.
If Bill Clinton has lost the
moral authority to be Presi
dent, and if he suborned and
committed perjury, obstructing
justice then he should go. This
country deserves better. "Slick
Willy" may not be slick enough.
First lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton wants us to
believe there is some type of
"right-wing" conspiracy against
the President. What world is
she living in? Give us a break,
Mrs. Clinton. People may hate
Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr, but Attorney General
Janet Reno, along with the

Third Judicial Circuit of Wash
ington, D.C. agree. This groups
includes a Judge appointed by
President Lyndon Johnson.
Judge Starr has hit a serious is
sue and lets remember his in
vestigation has not gone nearly
as long as Lawrence Walsh's
Iran-Contra investigation
which lasted seven years, five
of them being after Ronald
Reagan was retired from the
Presidency. He hounded Presi
dent George Bush all through
out his 1992 reelection cam
paign but found nothing. Let
Judge Starr complete his inves
tigation and uncover the truth.
No matter what the far-left says
about Judge Starr, it does not
take away from the charges
against the President. These
charges are so serious that they
could very well determine
whether it will be Al Gore or
Bill Clinton giving next year's
State of the Union Address.

High standards for high officials

by Cammie Grant
Contributing Writer
This past week, the
American public has been bom
barded with rumors about
President Clinton and his al
leged affair with Monica
Lewinsky. Lewinsky, a former
White House intern, claimed
that she and the president had
a sexual affair and he encour
aged her to cover it up. Clinton
responded, "I did not have
sexual relations with that
woman, Miss Lewinsky."
Lewinsky started work
in the White House, as an in
tern in the summer of 1995.

White House officials criticized
Lewinsky's work. She was
sloppy and perhaps a bit loud
and giggly. Hillary Rodham
Clinton has accused the "right
wing" of orchestrating this con
spiracy. The first lady is stand
ing by her man, even after her
husband has admitted to hav
ing an affair with Gennifer
Flowers, and now is denying an
affair with a woman half his
age. Commendably, Newt
Gingrich has decided not to
comment on the accusations
and let the White House handle
the situation. If the Republi
can Party is being accused by

Mrs. Clinton of creating a con
spiracy against her husband and
herself, the best thing for the
right wingers to do is stay out
of it. Obviously, the Republi
cans could not "dig up" or con
spire such information, as
many women have come for
ward. Hillary, open your eyes.
Other high-ranking people
have been punished for their
affairs, and Bill Clinton should
be as well. Kelly Flynn was
discharged from the Air Force
recently after having an affair.
Why should we lower our stan
dards for the Commander in
Chief of our country? After all,
The United States is a brilliant,

vivacious nation and the stan
dards we set should be high and
abided by our leaders. It is our
leader's duty to provide the
United States with the best
reputation.
The President of the
United States should make the
best moral and ethical deci
sions. Although it is not in the
Constitution, it is an obligation
of the president to set a good
standard for the public. Im
peachment is not facing the
president at this time, though,
he could be forced to resign
from office if any more hazard
ous information is presented.
Should the American public

trust a man who has been ac
cused more than once of hav
ing affairs? Should we trust a
man who claims that he "didn't
inhale" or break any laws of the
American government? How
much more lenient should the
public be with our president
and his moral and ethical deci
sions? I hope that in the next
presidential election, the
people will opt to vote for the
most _^qualified, morally
equipped, and honest indi
vidual. Voters should not be
worrying about what is going
on in the West Wing of the
White House and in the Oval,
or should I say "oral" office?


Consider this

At the end of this past se
mester, seven out of seven pro
fessors were granted the brass
ring of teaching, tenure. Given
the abysmal one out of three last
year, this was a significant im
provement.
Based on the fervor that
surrounded last year's much
publicized tenure denials, and
the recent court case, the ma
jority of the campus is aware
that tenure is based upon an
evaluation of the candidate's
research, teaching, and gover
nance.
According to procedure,
the most important quality is
teaching, with research and gov
ernance following respectively
Yet, is this really so?
Based on what this year's group
is saying, research may have
moved to the head of the line
in terms of importance.

Beyond this, does the col
lege even uphold any ranking of
these? How does the FPC mea
sure governance? And what
exactly is considered an ad
equate amount of research?
What has become increas
ingly obvious with the past two
years tenure groups is this: the
majority of the campus has no
idea how the tenure progress
works.
This isn't for lack of try
ing either. Last year, a group of
over one hundred students tried
to find out more and only ran

into a repetition or standard
protocol.
Further, based on a belief
that research is now more im
portant than teaching, it seems
that even the candidates them
selves are confused about what
they need to do to become a
permanent member of this col
lege community.
What can be done about
this issue?
It would be nice to see the
college, in its thrust to move
towards the future, take a long
and hard look at its tenure pro
cess. What do we value in our
staff? Are we a research or a
teaching institution? How do
we go about attracting the best
teachers we possibly can while
still generating academic pres
tige through research?

Let's be honest, everyone
on this campus knows of ten
ured professors who are excep
tional researchers but poor
teachers, exceptional teachers
but poor researchers, and those
who are exceptional in all ar¬

eas. This alone shows that
there are some obvious flaws
with our tenure system here at
Gettysburg College; to deny
this is to bury our collective
heads in the sand.
As a whole, the campus
should throw down the gaunt
let to the administration and
demand a tenure process re
view.

Conflict and Consensus -

"What planet was he on
when Regan was president_?

This is in response to
the exceedingly well-in
formed but far more naive
comments consistantly
written by John Dunlap in
the Pachyderm's Pulpit.
Here is my big news-flash:
BOTH . DEMOCRATS
AND REPUBLICANS LIE!
Conservativesare constantly
banging their fists at the
strings of lies told by Demo
crats. Mr. Dunlap discusses

the dignity brought into the
White House by former Presi
dent Reagan. What planet was
he on when Reagan was presi
dent? What concerns me is the
climate being created in Wash
ington, where no future presi
dent, from any political party,
will be able to run the country
without a special prosecuter
hiding in the shadows, scoop
ing up dirt, and believe me, all

politicians have plenty of it. To
be sure, Mr. Clinton has more
to hide than others but I would
rather have a leader with some
skeletons in his closet than one
who would put women back in
the kitchen, more pollution
into the environment, and a
gun in the hand and a cigarette
in the mouth of every teenager.

To the Editor:

This is a response to
Jay Spiese's article 'True Di
versity' (January 22). The
purpose of raising the issue
of diversity is unquestion
able. I agree that it is 'not a
matter of how we look 1 and
'True diversity comes from
the mind.' However, it is un
deniable that if not for all
but for most individuals
their 'minds' are influenced
by their backgrounds, expe
riences and the cultures they
were raised in.
Our thoughts are not
devoid of the various expe
riences we and/or our ances¬

tors have had. It does not mat
ter how we look but in many
instances our physical features
are an indication of where we
come from and how that has
shaped our minds (our intellect
and thinking). Jay raised many
issues all of which have
stemmed from his observation
that we can be diverse when we
show the diversity in our ideas
and actions. These ideas and
actions I feel cannot be taken
in a vacuum and those who ask
for diversity (such as more
people other than Caucasian)
are saying just that. Our ideas
and actions are influenced by

our cultural identities. A differ
ence of appearances in these
matters is unavoidable. Sec
ondly, it would be, if not any
thing, simply a matter of rec
ognition if the word 'Blacks' is
capitalized since we are not
talking about a color. If we
were to use Hispanics, Jews,
Asians it would make sense to
also use Africans or African
Americans.

Kabir Kumar

John Elway: Hall of Fame resume complete

by Steve Jenkins
Sports Editor
Who says you can't teach
an old dog new tricks? Thirty
seven year old, fifteen year
NFL veteran John Elway, fi
nally reached the pinnacle of a
legendary career with a Super
Bowl victory.
In a courageous effort
Elway passed, handed off,
fought, grabbed, fell, dove and
sprinted his way to a title which
eluded him in his previous
three Super Bowl appearances.
Before Super Bowl
XXXII, John Elway was a good
quaterback, probably the best
to never win the big game.
However, after a tremendous
display of heart and valor, John
Elway will be known as one of
the best.

"It was really incredible,"
said Bronco center Tom Nalen,
"You see your leader, your
franchise guy, giving his all. It
was real motivational for us to
see." Although his stats were
pretty average (12-23, 123

yards, 1 int, 1 rushing TD)
Elway was at the helm for one
of the more exciting Super
Bowls in recent history.
Another amazing thing
about the victory of the Bron
cos was that finally, after what
seemed like hundreds of years
watching the AFC get pum
meled in a weak attempts to
bring home the Super Bowl, the
Broncos finally did it.
Yes, it had been 13 years
since the Al Davis and the Oak
land Raiders last brought home
the Vince Lombardi Trophy.
That means the last time
the AFC won the Super Bowl
JAMS were in style, and The
Bangles rocked the house with
"Walk like an Egyptian."
With the score tied at 17-

facing a third-and-six on the
Packers 12 yard line. A fourth
down would mean a field goal
attempt and most likely a
three point lead, but the
touchdown was the priority.
In a play that typified the
Broncos' win, John Elway
evaded the rush of all-pro
Reggie White, and dove
bravely into the air. After be
ing smashed by Packers safety
Leroy Butler, Elway de
scended towards the early im
planting his fossil-like body to
the ground. One important
fact: he got the first down.
So, as the game ended
the crowd roared for the aged
veteran, and saw that he had
accomplished all he ever
needed.

17, in the fourth quarter the
Broncos were in the midst of a
long drive that started at their
eight yard line. It was the kind
of drive that eats the clock —
something Denver knew it had
to win.
Ten plays into the drive,
Elway had the Denver offense

No matter how many
years he continues to play, no
matter how many touchdowns
he has the rest of his career,
for now John Elway is the best
quaterback in football. And
watch out... he could be the
best ever.

Gettysburg gridiron to see major changes

by Ronnie Beeman
Contributing Writer
The Gettysburg football
team has wasted little time in
making changes for the 1998
football season. The Bullets are
altering the duties of some of
their coaches to dethrone West
ern Maryland as top dog in the
Centennial Conference.
The major move will see
the movement of head coach
Barry Streeter from offensive
coordinator to defensive coor
dinator. This allows for head
baseball coach and the new spe
cial teams/backfields coach
John Campo to devote his full
attention on his baseball duties,
instead of trying to prepare for
the upcoming football season.
Streeter is taking over a
defense that has lost four
starters. These include captains
Joe Hodakowski and Rob Sena,
Kevin Gurski, and Tom
Olchon.

Seniors Chris Felton, Jus
tin Domingos, Chad Mire,
Brain Murphy, Ryan
MacNamee and Jason Osborn
will be looked to for leadership.
Chris Lunardi is the heir appar-

Intramural basketball scores, bores, and eye sores

ent to Kevin "The Warrior"
Gurski's position at free safety.
Transfer Steve Brock,
Mike Graham, Gene Kraus,
Scott Grabus, Matt Ritz, Greg
Gudis, Justin Cheseroni, Brett
Thorpe and Pete Devlin occupy
the remaining spots on the "D."
The duties ot the offen
sive coordinator will be handed
to coach John Schmid. The of
fense seems in good shade with
only two senior starters lost,
second team All-Centennial
Conference selection Brain
Willard and center Kurt Ritter.
These holes will be filled
with senior Chris Nuss, juniors
Steve Jenkins and Tim Peltier,
and sophomores Chris
Matthaei, Mike Lorge, and
Brain Pokorny. They will be
playing along side senior leader
Justin Ogorek, junior Bill
Beining, and sophomore Jack
Starkey.

The tight ends are led by
senior Mike Holm. The rest
of the offensive backfield is
filled with seasoned players,
headlined by Third Team All
American Paul Smith as full
back.

Bullet players excited about changes and look to surge into next season. Photo By Em ' ly Glatfeller

Juniors Dereck Reed and
Matt Helwig are returning
starters with Dan Sheets, Jay
Jablonski, and Brian
_Pojanowski in reserve. The re
ceivers are a veteran group.
Seniors Jeff Closz and Rob
Crowe, and junior Tighe Burns

lead the receiving corp.
The quarterback position
has returning starter Dennis
Flaherty, with contention from
senior Chris Fugaro, junior
Weston Wells, and sophomore
Jeff Boyd.
The Bullets are working

hard for the up coming season.
The most visible change for the
Bullets will be their new or
ange helmets. They are simi
lar to the helmets adorned by
the University of Syracuse.
The Bullets opponents will
soon be aware of the orange
crush. See you in the fall!



Hardcourt Harmony

The return of sophomore
Bill Davidson from a severe
ankle sprain also helped the
Bullets inside rebounding as he
contributed not only defen
sively but also grabbed some of
fensive rebounds. The Bullets
went into the locker room with
a 38-32 deficit.
fter a spectacular
alftime show by the newly
formed Basketball pep Band,
the Bullets came out charging.
Sophomore Ryan Napp (18)
and Schreiber (18) combined
for a nice inside outside game.
The Bullets again did an
excellent job of boxing out and
keeping the taller Alvernia
team off the boards. With
Napp hitting from the outside
the driving lanes were wide
open and the Bullets took ad
vantage.

the second half, Pfeil drove

Bullets shoot past Alvernia

by Paul Redfern
Staff Writer

The Gettysburg College
Men's Basketball team com
pleted a great week finishing 2
1. They lost at Western Mary
land, 63-74, Wednesday night.
On Saturday, the team traveled
to Washington College and
played in what Coach George
Petrie described as the team's
best effort of the year.
The Bullets came away
with an outstanding 74-63 win.
Washington College was the
leader in the Centennial
Conference's East Division.
The Bullets then played region
ally ranked Alvernia College,
one of last year's Final Four
contenders. The Bullets went
down early but fought back to
win 77-73.
Alvernia got on top in the
game early with field goals
from Lonnie Walker their big
inside player. Alvernia got help
in the first half going 3-4 from
beyond the three-point line.

But the Bullets fought
back, shooting 13-25 or 52%
from the field. Freshman Greg
Schreiber, sophomore Rich
Pfeil, and senior Terry
Schofield all played a key de
fensive role in stopping Walker.

dunked sparking a run for the
Bullets. Down the stretch, jun
ior guard Jon Bowman did a
great job of containing the
Alvernia point guard and lead
ing scorer Damien Hunter.
Bowman, along with great de
fense from the rest of the
squad, was able to force Hunter
into taking off balanced shots.

The Bullets pulled ahead
by two with just under one
minute remaining in the game.
After several missed free throw
attempts, the Bullets were fi
nally able to hit from the line
and go up by the final score of
77-73. With these games Get
tysburg moves to 9-8 overall
and 3-3 in the conference. This
week the Bullets travel to con
ference foe Swarthmore on Sat
urday at 7:30p.m., and then
play rival Franklin & Marshall
at home on Wednesday, Febru
ary 4 with a tip-off time of
8:00p.m.
In team notes, sources
close to the team report that
the Bullets recent success has
been attributed to freshman
forward Mike Monroe's switch
to Polo socks. Very interesting.

Olympic Spotlight

by Matthew Eisenberg
Assistant Sports Editor
On February 7, 1998
Nagano Japan welcomes 3,000
athletes from 83 countries. The
torch has been on its tour of 47
Japanese prefectures that began
on January 6, 1998. The
United States will be bringing
approximately 200 athletes, in
cluding men's and women's
snowboarding and the newest
edition to the Olympics:
women's ice hockey.
The opening ceremonies
will begin at 9 p.m. ET and the
first day of events will be pre
liminary rounds of men's ice
hockey. Italy vs. Kazakhstan, 2
a.m. ET; Germany vs. Japan, 6
a.m. ET; Austria vs. Slovakia, 2
a.m. ET; France vs. Belarus, 6
a.m. ET. These teams will be
vying for two spots to battle the
hockey heavyweights such as
Team USA, Canada, and Swe-

With the addition of
NHL players entering the
Olympic mix the medals race

is clearly undecided. Team USA
is favored with strong competi
tion from Team Canada. How
ever, keep your eyes on the
mighty Czech Republic with
Dominik Hasek and Jaromir
Jagr, as well as Finland, Sweden,
and Russia all boasting all-star
rosters.
Team USA women's ice
hockey also brings an all-star

Bullet Wrestlers continue to "take down" competition

From Staff Reports
A five march winning
streak, all against Centennial
Conference opponents, has
boosted the Gettysburg Col
lege wrestling team's overall
record to 10-6-1.
Since concluding the pre
holiday portion of its 1997-98
campaign at 2-3, Head Coach
Troy Dell's squad has won
eight matches, dropped only
three and tied one. The tie was
against Franklin & Marshall,
which fields a Division I wres
tling program, and it was a 21
12 victory over Ursinus that
jump-started the Bullets on
their current five-match win
ning streak.
The Bullets have five dual
matches remaining prior to the
Centennial Conference Cham
pionships at Swathmore on
Saturday, February 14.

Senior Jamie Binnall has
fashioned a 12-11 record at
118 pounds. Including the six
pins he has had this seasons,
Binnall's career total now
stands at 27, making him one
of only four wrestlers in
Gettysburg's history to reach
that goal.
Although a majority of
Marty Scarpato's matches this
season were at 134 pounds, the
junior has recently begun com
peting at 126. His overall
record is 18-8, including a re
cent 8-4 decision over the de
fending Centennial Conference
champion at 126, Bucky
Johnson of Ursinus. He has a
team-leading 95 takedowns
this season.
Senior Mike Ben'Ary,
who recently moved up to the
134-pound weight class from
126, has won three of his lat
est four matches to up his over
all record to 6-17.

Residence Life changes summer housing policy

By Laura Root
StaffReporter The Office of Residence Life has
changed its summer housing policy.
Due to the maintenance that needs
to be done in all residence halls over the
summer, there will be greater restrictions
placed on the number of students allowed
to stay on campus during the months of
May through August.
In the past, Residence Life has re
ceived complaints about the conditions
of students' rooms that had been utilized
for summer housing.
Although students are cleared out
of the dorms by early August, mainte
nance often has not had the time to get
the rooms in top condition for the fall

semester. Now, the priority is being
placed on getting the dorms in better
shape. This summer, Residence Life plans
to use one dorm for housing instead of
the twelve that have been used in the past
in order try to renovate the rest.
Renovations are especially neces
sary in Special Interest Houses. Because
Gettysburg College does not offer sum
mer classes, Residence Life feels that this
is a reasonable change.
Several groups proposed changing
the summer housing policy. Residence
Life, Maintenance, and members of con
ferences that use Gettysburg's facilities
over the summer all agreed that some
thing needed to be done.
Action was taken in the fall when
the new plan was devised. Usually, be
tween 80 and 100 students stay in

Gettysburg dorms over the summer. In
ternational students, students interning
with academic departments, students do
ing research, students employed by the
college, and students who have no affili
ation with activities on campus during the
summer, but one working in town or at
tending summer school at a nearby col
lege, are all given the opportunity to re
main in Gettysburg.
The only criteria that a student stay
ing the summer has to meet is to have
been enrolled in Gettysburg College for
some part of the previous school year.
Currently, there are 140 spots re
served for summer housing. All students
will be staying in either Musselman or
Patrick Halls. The final decision on which
hall will be harboring students will be
made once it is determined which one

needs less work this summer. If any more
students apply for housing, Residence Life
may be forced to prioritize.
Students who need to stay in dorms
the least may then be denied summer
housing.
Student reactions to the change
have been mixed. Although they are
happy to have a place to stay, some are
disappointed that there is no longer a wide
variety of summer residences to choose
from. Tim Rupe, Director of Residence
Life believes that his staff has imple
mented a change for the better. "Our lack
of readiness in the fall was inexcusable,"
he says, "We need to be prepared."
Dean Julie Ramsey agrees. She be
lieves that, "This is a fair policy that will
cater to the needs of all students."

North Washington St. will be made avail
able as Honors Housing for the academic
year 1998-99, said the College and Resi
dence Life Offices of Gettysburg College.
About 11 students will be housed
in the new campus building next semes
ter, after renovations are made over the
summer. "It should be fully networked,"
said Scott Simonds, Assistant Director of
Residence Life, Apartments and Special
Interest Housing Area. "I am not sure how
many singles or doubles . . . primarily
singles," he added.
The house was purchased after
the owners approached Gettysburg Col
lege with an offer to sell. "It is the kind of
housing that students are attracted to;
close to the campus, much smaller than
typical residence hall," said Julie Ramsey
Dean of College Life. "We got a pretty
good price on it.... Not a good deal but
a reasonable deal."

, 3.25 and Sophomores with a minimum
of 3.5 and those recommeded by a fac
ulty member and under no disciplinary
action will be eligible to apply to live in
the house for the fall semester.
Along with 225 North Washington,
215 North Washington and Ice House
Building D will be part of the Honors
Housing. Tudor Apartments, which have
previously been Honors Housing will be
part of the regular selection of housing
on-campus for the academic year 1998
99. The new building was acquired to
help the college with the "housing
crunch" according to Ramsey. "We con
tinue to have more students than beds,"
she said. "It is hard to tell how the fresh
man class comes in ... may be large
again," said Simonds. "We need addi
tional beds."
Most of the buildings along North
Washington St. are Gettysburg College
property. "In the longterm it makes sense
to develop that side of the street," said
Simonds.

Honor Commission sees dramatic increase in number of cases

by Henry Fawell
Staff Reporter
The past year at
Gettysburg College has seen a
significant increase in reported
violations of the school's Honor
Code. While the exact number
of the cases could not be deter
mined, one Honor Commission
member approximated the num
ber to be as high as forty.
"This is a tremendous in
crease," said Brian Pumphrey,
who just completed his one-year
term as Chairman of the Honor
Commission, "I have been on the
Commission for three years and
never during that time did we
receive so many reported viola
tions." While the student-run
Honor Commission has been
working hard to deal with the
sudden boost in the number of
hearings, several defendants de
cided to plead guilty before their
respective cases had even

reached that stage.
One of the most notable
Honor Code violations at the
College occurred last spring
within the Computer Science
department, when fourteen stu
dents from three separate
courses were tried and found
guilty of plagiarism. In 1997,
nearly one-third of all reported
violations came from within the
Computer Science Department,
including another five incidents
unrelated to those of last spring.
This sharp rise can be at
tributed the computer's in
creased bearing on classroom
work, as well as the sti dent's
ability to gain a tremendous
amount of information off the
Internet in a short period of time.
With the rise in computer
related violations, plagiarism has

Administrator sues for being called a "Butt-licker"

College Press Service

puter glitch and poor proof
reading. To create the news
paper page, they had used a
template containing titles so
absurd no one could forget to
change them — or so they
thought. But the damage al
ready was done, said Yeagle's
attorney, Leisa Ciaffone.
"Even if there was an
accident, the laws of this state
prevent people from negli
gence," said Ciaffone.
Yeagle has asked the
Virginia Supreme Court to re
view the case and to decide
whether she is entitled to a jury
trial. A lower court dismissed
the case last year. Circuit Judge
Ray W. Grubbs said no reason
able person could have read the
article — which correctly iden
tified Yeagle by name and po
sition — and then believed the
bold quotes attached contained
Yeagle's real title.
"This is an unfortu-

Editors at Virginia Tech's
student newspaper claimed it
was a terrible mistake when a
Virginia Tech administrator
was referred to as the "direc
tor of butt-licking" in an edi
tion of The Collegiate Times.
The student journalists say
dummy type accidently made
it into print.
But the administrator,
Sharon Yeagle, isn't buying that
explanation. Yeagle, the assis
tant to the university's vice
president, believes she was the
target of a cruel joke and has
filed suit against the newspaper
for printing the 1996 article.
She wants at least $850,000 to
make up for the damage she
claims was done to her profes
sional and personal reputation.
Student editors sent a
letter of apology to Yeagle the
day after the article ran, ex
plaining the mistake was made
from a combination of a com-

nate incident that she has to
move on from and become a
little more thick-skinned
about," said James R.
Creekmore, the student
newspaper's attorney. "I don't
think a reasonable reader
would think this an assertion
of fact, and if it's not asserted
as correct — a person's repu
tation can't be harmed.
"But let's say someone
assumed the title was correct,"
he continued. "In this context,
it goes the route of subjective
opinion and impression. It be
comes a matter of free speech
and expression. What may be
a butt-licker to one person isn't
necessarily a butt-licker to an
other." However, the crude
phrase is easily defined as
someone who shamelessly cur
ries favor for personal and pro
fessional gain, Ciaffone said.
To make matters worse,
Ciaffone said, the article ap
pearing with the bold quotes

featured a string of glowing
comments from Yeagle about
the university sending students
to a state honors program.
"My client makes
some very positive comments,
and The Collegiate Times essen
tially calls her a brown-nosers,
an apple-polisher and a kiss
ass," Ciaffone said. "If some
one reads that story and they
don't know Sharon Yeagle, they
may not believe a word she
says." "Ms. Yeagle is a pro
fessional woman who is very
good at her job and worked
very hard to get where she is."
That is why it has been
difficult for Yeagle to endure
the snickers and jokes that have
come from co-workers, super
visors, and even her son's class
mates, Ciaffone said.
"People were laughing
the day it ran, and they're still
laughing," Ciaffone said.

become the most com
mon form of an Honor Code
violation at Gettysburg. Cheat
ing on tests or quizzes taken in
class constitute the lowest num
ber of reported cases.
Coincidentally, a slight
increase in student-filed reports
has not overshadowed the fact
that professors, who notice the
plagiarized works yet are ab
sent during tests an quizzes, still
file an overwhelmingly larger
number of reports.
Pumphrey, though, re
mains quite optimistic about
the state of the Honor Com
mission, "There is no evidence
anywhere suggesting that more
students cheat now than a just
few years ago."
He went on to explain
that the rise in student-filed
reports suggests that students
who witness a violation are
now more willing to turn in

their peers. This can attributed
to the Commission's active ori
entation methods for first year
students.
Tucker Marshall, who
succeeded Pumphrey as Chair
man, has been working hard
with the Commission to pro
mote the Honor System
throughout the college. "The
Honor Commission has come
up with several ideas," he said,
"including marketing the
Honor system through signs,
posters, common hours and
student/faculty surveys. There's
even the possibility of a web
page." These new efforts should
better familiarize the student
body with their Honor system
and prove that, as Pumphrey
concluded, "schools that ad
here to an Honor Code will
find that more students are
willing to take part in it, which
ultimately promotes the good
nature of the system."

Service with a smile

by Cara Masucci
Staff Reporter So many aspects of col
lege life exist that sometimes
one can spend four years at
college and never fully take
advantage of all opportunities
available to him or her. Amidst
the academic and social scene,
the sect of service projects can
sometimes get lost in the
shuffle. Fortunately, this is not
the case at Gettysburg College.
Quickly gaining national
attention as a school geared
towards service, Gettysburg has
many opportunities for stu¬

dents who want to get involved
a small amount or on an exten
sive level. From service learn
ing trips to Alpha Phi Omega
t(j> special interest housing, the
community and college are eas
ily accessible to anyone willing
to donate their time and effort.
A major facet of service
on the campus has always been
the Center for Public Service
(CPS). Starting within the
Chapel, the CPS has given the
college a large variety of issues
and opportunities for service.
Largely run by the students, the
administrators are there to as
sist in details and smooth out

the rough edges.
Various students coordi
nate projects with community
members in different area that
range from elderly issues to
hunger and homelessness.
The CPS also maintains a
large variety of yearly activities
and projects that include GIV
(Gettysburg Is Volunteering)
Day during orientation and ser
vice learning trips.
According to administra
tive intern Darcy Daniels, the
CPS runs both GIV Day and
Greek GIV Day, as well as the
Fiesta in the fall for migrant
children of the community,
AIDS Awareness Week, Christ
mas toy drives, and Mission of
Mercy.
Along with their main
projects, the CPS picks up vari
ous other campus and commu
nity projects.

Speaking with Daniels,
she conveyed the CPS aims to
raise campus awareness, not
only of each other and the
community, but also of the
world as a whole.
"There are people out
there that do not have the same
opportunities as we have,"
Daniels commented. "It is our
job to use our education, man
power, and strength to assist
them in their needs."

Junior Megan Mecca went on a service learning trip to the Carolinas. Here
students work hard cleaning up an area of woods.

land. Currently, if people
would like to get involved,
they can contact the CPS at
x6490 or
"serve@gettysburg.edu" If
there is something the person
is especially interested in, they
should specify their likes and
dislikes, and the appropriate
coordinator will contact them.
For those willing to get
involved on a much broader
scale, the center is currently
accepting applications for pro
gram coordinators to go out
and work with community
contacts and provide the cam
pus with an outlet for service.
Anyone wishing to do so can
pick up an application at the
center.

Senior Jaime Foanio
took advantage of an aspect of
the CPS over the fall reading

days when she went on a ser
vice learning project to New
York City. Foanio had always
been interested in going on a
service learning trip, but did not
have the opportunity to do so
until this year. In New York she
helped out an AIDS organiza
tion in delivering meals to those
in the advanced stages of the
disease.
Foanio said she really en
joyed her trip, not only because
of the knowledge she gained in
working with the AIDS patients,

but her opportunity to meet dif
ferent students and faculty
members from the campus.
One of over twenty projects
worldwide, the trip was not
entirely hard work. There was
time to go sightseeing and catch
a Broadway show.
Foanio was able to get a
scholarship that covered 80 per
cent of the trip's cost from the
CPS. Daniels stated that al
though they have limited re
sources, the center gives all it
can to the scholarship fund.
Other organizations are also
available to give out service
learning scholarships. Foanio
stated that the trip was such a
great experience that she would
"definitely recommend it to ev
eryone on campus."
For four sophomores, the
service experience that has im¬

pacted their lives is on campus.
Nick Stefonich, Jamey
Gallagher, Brett Montich, and
project leader Chris Hill have
a special interest apartment
that allows them to work with
the school in advancing recy
cling. The students record how
much water they use within the
apartment, and from these re
sults, they try to find a solution
to cutting down the amount of
water wasted. They also count
and recycle glass, aluminum,

So
far,

the quad has found that much
of the campus is not conducive
to recycling. Several dorms on
campus do not have recycling
containers, and the most acces
sible cardboard receptacle is lo
cated far from most dorms.
From their findings, the quad
gives feedback to the college on
how to improve the amount of
recyclables, and how many
people recycle.
The quad likes their liv
ing arrangement because, as
Montich states, "It [special in
terest housing] gives you a big
ger sense of responsibility." Es
sentially, you are in charge of
yourself, and this aids to a sense
of independence.
The students are quick to
point out, though, that al
though they are essentially be
ing rewarded for recycling, it

is something that everyone
should do.
To get involved in such
activities, contact GECO
(which the group has a repre
sentative in) or talk to the En
vironmental Studies depart¬

me. For those wanting to join
peers in service, the co-ed ser
vice fraternity Alpha Phi
Omega provides a good outlet.
Based on the principles of lead
ership, friendship, and service,
Alpha Phi Omega is a mix of
service opportunities and stu
dents from all different areas
on campus.
It has a brotherhood of
about seventy active members,
with a pledge period similar to
that of social Greeks.
According to chapter
president Mary Wilkes, Alpha

Phi Omega is involved in activi
ties like the Care program,
Habitat for Humanity, Adopt
a-Highway, and an annual
blood drive. The chapter is in
constant contact with the CPS.
Alpha Phi Omega also provides
service to the community by
doing things like ushering
events for other organizations.
There is a bulletin board
in the CUB where Alpha Phi
Omega posts its service
projects. If you walk by and
see an activity you would like
to do, just contact Alpha Phi
Omega, and you are more than
welcome to work with the

group.
Plenty of opportunities
exist for anyone on campus
that would like to get involved
on a small or large scale. Aside
from the opportunities men
tioned above, organizations
like Circle K, Bacchus, and the
Student Alumni Association set
up service projects throughout
the year.
Service can be rewarding,
not only to those receiving it,
but to the giver as well. Every
person asked about their ser
vice projects said decisively that
the service they had done gave
them a sense of goodness and
accomplishment.



Science for the young

by Allison Zoller
Contributing Reporter
How does someone so
young get placed in charge of
such important research? This
is the first question that popped
into my mind upon meeting
with the creator of Gettysburg
College's Molecular Biology
Department, Dr. Steven James.
In a generation hooked on ER
and Chicago Hope, the word
doctor no longer brings to
mind the image of a sixty-year
old man walking around in
hospital scrubs. George
Clooney and Noah Wyle have
popularized the notion of
young doctors with big respon
sibilities.

Although this typical pre
sentation may no longer be
commonplace, I was not pre
pared for what greeted me
when I first met James. Born
January 17, 1958, in Detroit,
Michigan, James does not look
a day over his 39 years. And
yet he is conducting research
that could lead to major break
throughs in the areas of cancer
treatment and physical rehabili
tation. Age is not important if
you know what you want to do.
While age may not be a
significant factor in success or
failure, education certainly is.
Young Steve James started his
quest for knowledge at our very
own Gettysburg College. It
was "serendipity," since he

wasn t sure how to go about
choosing the right school. In
1980, he graduated with a B.A.,
which would serve as his ticket
into graduate school. James
received his master's degree in
botany from the University of
Minnesota in 1983. After 13
long years of higher education,
James earned himself a new
title; the "Mr." changed to
"Dr." when James earned a
Ph.D. in Cell and Developmen
tal Biology from the University
of Minnesota in 1989.
For his post-doctorate
study, James spent three years
conducting research at the Uni
versity of Medicine and Den
tistry in New Jersey (UMDNJ),
under the care of Dr. N. Ronald
Morris. Morris became a role
model for James, as he was one
of the founders of Cell Cycle
Research, which is the area of
biology James eventually de
cided to pursue through his re
search.

In 1992, James was hired
by Gettysburg College to start
a Molecular Biology program,
bringing him back to the place
he started all those years ago,
thus finishing his formal edu
cation and starting a new stage
of his life: research.
James has spent the past
eight years researching two
genes essential for cellular re
production. The experiments
James and his students are now
performing are timely and

costly because the techniques
and equipment used are not
easy or foolproof. Where does
someone get money for this
kind of research?
Foundations such as the
Howard Hughes Medical Insti
tute in Washington were estab
lished to provide for young re
searchers such as James. The
Hughes Institute gives grants to
colleges and universities, in or
der to "advance the field of sci
ence." In 1991, Gettysburg Col
lege was selected to be the re
cipient of one of these grants.
Gettysburg was given the sum
of $850,000 to be spread over
a period of five years. This
money was to be used to start
departments in Molecular Bi
ology and Biochemistry. As a
result, James was hired.- Most
of his funding comes from the
Hughes Foundation, which will
run out this year.

A major component of
James' job was to begin and
oversee a research program in
which undergraduates can take
part. Part of the Hughes Grant
provides funding for a summer
research program during which
time three students are hired
full time for ten weeks to re
search gene cloning. Student
research in this program has
ranged anywhere from six
months to three years. Imag
ine spending three years trying
to accomplish one thing, in an
area where failure is not an
option. As James says, "You get
used to failure. There are al
ways going to be roadblocks."
In the words of James,
"Part of being a good scientist
is being able to choose between
things to work on - the key is
to have a knack for knowing
which question to-pursue; that
advances science."

What good would re
search-be if you didn't share it
with the world? In addition to
overseeing research, teaching
classes in cell biology and mo
lecular genetics, and finding
time for his family, James has
managed to write seven differ
ent publications. Dr. James has
also presented ten papers to
various professional societies, is
currently working on several
writings, and has received nu
merous awards and fellowships

Actors Darby Jared Leigh (left) is Peer and Debe'Taylor is
his dying mother in Peer Gynt, which will be performed by
the National Theater for the Deaf in the CUB Ballroom on
February 10 at 8 p.m.

Peer to perform

since 1980.
So far, James has just
been described as a series of ac
complishments. Although he
probably doesn't get away
from the lab often enough,
when he does, James has a wife
and two young sons to go
home to. He takes part in the
Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts,
_dnd goes camping with his fam
ily in Maine and Ontario.
James earned money one
summer during his college
years guiding canoe trips in
Quetico Provincial Park, in
Western Ontario. He relives
this summer by taking Boy
Scout troops on 10-day trips
throughthe same park. In ad
dition to spending time out
doors fishing, camping and ca
noeing, James has also taken
up cycling.

With everything else that
he is doing, Dr. James still takes
the time to get to know the stu
dents and answer their ques
tions in person, as opposed to
the impersonal but quick e-

mail approach taken by some
professors.
James is pushing at the
limits of molecular biology,
earning recognition for himself
and for the school, and he is
not even "over-the-hill." My
sentiments are best put by Dr.
James himself, "If you are
clever enough and enjoy what
you're doing enough to persist
you will succeed.!'
Last semester, each stu
dent in Professor _Marshall's
Writing About Science first-year
seminar had the opportunity to
interview and write a profile
about a professor of his/her
choice in one of the science de
partments. In an effort to ex
tend these insights to the entire
campus, several profiles have
been selected to be printed in
the Gettysburgian over the next
few weeks.

Reel Hits and Misses What the Dickens?!

Kf'JDan Larkin and Mike Petro
_fii_$i/Columnists
_%f.
'' : In many literary circles,
Great Expectations is consid
ered to be Charles Dickens' fin
est work. Granted, I am say
ing this not from experience,
but from something I read on
the Internet. (My sincerest
hope that I will not incur the
wrath of our fine English de
partment here on campus.)
However, I can say this
from experience: the new film
adaptation of the classic tale,
directed by Alphonso Cuaron
and starring Ethan Hawke
(who has lately turned to writ
ing fiction), Gwenyth Paltrow
and Anne Bancroft, is far from
an American classic.

Hollywood seems to have
exhausted the cinematic possi
bilities of William Shakespeare
and Jane Austen, moving on to
Dickens as the author du jour.
Like some of the more recent
Norton Anthology-to-big
screen adventures, Great Ex
pectations has been moved
from its original setting to a
more contemporary backdrop.
In addition; the names of
the novel's central characters
have been changed. Apparently
Dickens' characters' names
seemed out-of place in a mod
ern setting, so the character of
Pip has been given the much
more contemporary "Finn."
But, the change from the novel's

original setting is not the prob
lem with the film. Not to
worry, director Cuaron finds
other ways to disappoint.
For those of you who
don't know the general story,
Finn (Hawke), plays a brilliant
artist who grew up poor in the
Florida panhandle, lusting af
ter his best friend, the rich niece
of Ms. Dinsmoor (Bancroft),
Estella (Paltrow).
Finn's life is traced, in
cluding his upbringing, an en
counter with an escaped mur
derer (Robert DeNiro), and his
eventual rise to prominence in
the New York City art world.
Much like my synopsis of
this movie, the plot is full of
holes, and as a whole, the story
just doesn't flow well at all.
Hawke (Gattaca, Reality
Bites) turns in a good perfor
mance, as does Bancroft (The
Graduate, GI Jane) as the
quirky and partly mad Ms.
Dinsmoor.

As for Paltrow (Emma,
Hook), she turns in an icily
erotic performance that
projects a snobbish and heart
less demeanor, yet hints to the
viewer that there is a softness
within. In fact, one of the few
highlights of this work is see
ing Paltrow maintain the air of
snobbishness broken at time&
by tenderness.
Great Expectations really
doesn't do a very good job hold
ing the story together. The tran¬

sitions made by the film's many
shifts in time are not handled
well ( a problem augmented by
the fact that Hawke and
Paltrow look exactly the same,
whether they're eighteen or
twenty eight.)
This is, however, a really
good looking movie. Both the
scenes set in Florida and New
York are visually spectacular.
The rest of the cast is well
put together. DeNiro (We're
No Angels, Raging Bull) turns
in one of his usual strong per
formances, and one character

worth seeing is Finn's uncle
Joe, played extremely well by
Chris Cooper (A Time to Kill,
Money Train).
The supporting cast of
Great Expectations is probably
the best reason for anyone to
go see it. Cooper does an ad
mirable job, and Bancroft is hi
larious, basically stealing the
show in all of her scenes.
DeNiro is almost incapable of
turning in a bad performance
(hell, I'd have given Spice
World a star or two if he was in
it) and this is no exception.

My main problem with
the movie comes from the two
central characters. Hawke (the
thinking-man's Chris
O'Donnell) and Paltrow (better
known as Brad Pitt's ex) should
hold the film together, but in
stead they turn in fairly lack
luster performances, around
which Great Expectations falls

apart. As a whole, this movie is
a beautifully filmed movie filled
with lush and well designed
scenes. Further, the.well as
sembled cast does a solid job.
However, the plot leaves
too many questions unan
swered, and the fact that so
many changes were made from
the original make this movie
something I would say is best
left alone until video.
I give Great Expecta
tions, for good acting and be
ing technically sound, two out
of five stars.

Overall, this movie is
pretty weak. While great visu

In Case You Missed It
Pacino and DeNiro beat up the screen

by Eileen O'Donnell
Movie Columnist
When you put two film
legends like Al Pacino and Rob
ert DeNiro together on screen,
the result is explosive. Writer/
director Michael Mann pits
these box office giants against
one another in the 1995 movie
Heat. The supporting cast is
dynamic, with actors like Val
Kilmer (The Saint), Jon Voigt
(Mission: Impossible), and
Ashley Judd (Kiss the Girls).
The chemistry of this cast is
incredible, and it makes the
movie extremely enjoyable.
Heat is the story of Neil
McCauley (DeNiro), the leader
of a gang of high profile, tech
nically proficient armed rob
bers. McCauley and his crew
are pursued by the LAPD's
most dedicated cop, Vincent
Hanna (Pacino).

Neil has lined up one last
score, and is planning to leave
his life of crime and settle into

a regular lifestyle with his new
girlfriend, Edie.
His plans are complicated

(singer I

Hanna '
is also
trying
to get his

gether. His third marriage is
suffering because of his dedi
cation to his work, and his re
lationship with his wife and

s own life back to-

stepdaughter (Natalie Portman)
is disintegrating.
The plot of the movie
takes many twists and turns,
and all of the characters, no

matter how insignificant they
might seem, come together in
the end. Likewise, the support
ing actors are very important to
the success of the film.

Kilmer gives a stunning
performance as Chris,
McCauley's protege, whose
marriage is falling apart, and
wife Charlene (Judd) is about

t o
leave with their son.
Charlene wants
t o

sanity
and stabil
i t y
into their lives,
and to
d o
that,

she faces the dilemma of turn
ing Chris in to save the baby
from a foster home.
Each criminal's relation
ship with his family brings a

more human element to the
film. _.
Only once before have
DeNiro and Pacino appeared in
the same film. In The Godfa
ther II, DeNiro portrays a
young Vito Corleone, during
his rise to power in the world
of organized crime. Pacino re
prises his role as Michael
Corleone, the new don of the
Corleone crime family. The
two never met on screen in the
movie, as DeNiro's role existed
solely in flashbacks.
DeNiro's McCauley is
quiet and reserved, yet in the
blink of an eye, he can fly into
a murderous rage. Pacino's
character is emotional and ex
plosive. These two film giants
are what gives the film pa
nache, and the story is substan
tial enough to keep you in sus
pense the whole time.

Heat is by far one of the
best action epics of this decade.
DeNiro and Kilmer have you
cheering for the bad guys until
the end.

Band to rock Huber

by Jared Kaufman
Contributing Reporter
Have you ever wondered
what it would sound like if you
combined the sounds of the
Dave Matthews Band, the
Beatles, and George Clinton?
That's how Joel Streeter, lead
vocalist, guitarist, and
songwriter for Fizgigg, de
scribes his band's unique
sound.
Fizgigg's innovative mu
sic combines the traditional
guitar, bass guitar, drums, and
sax with a cello and sometimes
a congo drum.
Bass guitar is played by
Kyle Gebhart. Of Gebhart's
bass playing, Streeter says,
"Kyle can really play. His tal
ent really comes through on
* Intruder.'"

Drums are handled by
Jeremy Gantz, and Dave
Winjum plays the alto and so
prano saxes. Look for a stel
lar solo by Winjum in the song
"Buck."

The cello is played by
Garon Taylor-Tyree, a cellist
with eight years of classical
training. However, he aban
doned his classical roots to play
provide a lively, upbeat sound
on tracks such as "You Stay"
and "Intruder."
Gantz also plays the
congo drum, which is used in
all of Fizgigg's acoustic perfor¬

mances.
On top of the band's
original material, Fizgigg also
does covers of Paul Simon,
Phish, and the Dave Matthews
Band. Fizgigg has played before
at Gettysburg, at a Coffee
house.
If you think you would
like to hear Fizgigg for your
self, then come to Huber Lobby
this Saturday at 10 p.m. If you
have enjoyed their music up to
this point, be sure to come to
this performance, as the band
has some new material.
And don't forget to re
quest the soon-to-be classic
"Shaft;" he's a bad...you know

Conflict and Consensus
An open letter to the campus community

I want to talk with you
about one of the most impor
tant issues on our campus—stu
dent drinking.
Let me begin by saying
that this is a very difficult topic
for us as a community to dis
cuss. Like many of you, I am
not a teetotaler; I occasionally
enjoy a drink with meals, and
it's hard not to feel either hypo
critical or preachy when talk
ing with others about "appro
priate" behavior surrounding
this issue. Yet as a college presi
dent, not a day goes by when I

am not reminded of the tragic
effects that alcohol can have on
a college campus. Student
drinking is widely perceived to
be the number-one health and
safety issue on college cam
puses today. Over the first part
pf-this academic,.year,,the na
tional media brought us news
of several alcohol-related stu
dent deaths at other colleges
and universities. Here at Get
tysburg, we have seen numer
ous students taken to the hos
pital for over-consumption of
alcohol.

While the issue of student
drinking is of unanimous con
cern, there is no widespread
agreement about how colleges
should respond to this prob
lem. Nationally, the debate
about student drinking tends to
be polarized around two ex
treme stances. First, there are
those who advocate "dry cam
puses" —that is, banning alco
hol anywhere on campus, in
cluding at on-campus parties
and in student residences. On
the other side are those who
argue that "kids will be kids."
These individuals tend to be
lieve that drinking is a normal
and natural part of the college
experience, a "phase" students
go through on the road to re
sponsible adulthood. For col
leges to interfere with this pro
cess, these individuals argue, is
fr> exceed the _hnnndaries nf

appropriate monitoring, step
ping too far into the outdated
notion of in loco parentis.
In fact, both of these po¬

sitions have merit. Yet for
many types of institutions, in
cluding smaller, residential, lib
eral arts colleges like Gettys
burg, neither approach is ideal.
For better or for worse,
drinking is a part of the way
that most college students—
and for that matter, most
Americans— socialize. And if
we accept that most students
are going to drink, we must ask
ourselves, "What in our envi
ronment leads to safe and re
sponsible consumption of alco
hol? And what in our culture
tends to reinforce and perpetu¬

ate abusive, illegal, and exces
sive alcohol consumption?"
The dry campus option can
lead to unmonitored drinking
in off-campus settings that are
difficult to supervise. When
overconsumption occurs,in
such circumstances, the results
can be deadly. On the other
hand, a laissez faire attitude
toward alcohol consumption—
one that allows students to
drink as much as they want to
whenever and wherever they
want to, assuming that they will
quit when they've had
enough—can be equally disas¬

. What, then, are colleges
to do? Each institution must
ask, "What makes sense for us?
What makes sense for our stu
dents?" Clearly, we must obey
the law. And there are certain
types of drinking—drinking
games and binge drinking, for
example—that are especially
dangerous and that should
never be tolerated. But within
this framework there is latitude
and room for debate on which
approach is best suited to indi
vidual institutions.
At Gettysburg, I believe
that we must address this issue
with a three-pronged approach
that provides support for those
who do not wish to drink, per
mits legal and responsible con
sumption for those who wish
to drink (and are legally al
lowed to do so), and provides
for quick and aggressive action
against illegal and abusive con¬

sumption of alcohol.
Make no mistake about
it: Gettysburg College students
are at severe risk for the dan
gers associated with alcohol
consumption. Empirical evi
dence supports our anecdotal
observations: A recent CORE
survey shows that students at
residential, liberal arts colleges
are more likely than students
at large universities to partici
pate in binge drinking. Students
at schools in small towns or
rural settings are more likely to
drink to excess than their coun
terparts at schools in urban set
tings, and students at colleges
in the Northeast demonstrate
higher incidents of binge drink
ing than students at schools in

other parts of the country. Fi
nally, students at schools with
active Greek systems are far
more likely to drink to excess
than students, at schools with
out fraternities and sororities.
It is essential, then, that
Gettysburg—and schools like
Gettysburg—take an active and
aggressive role in helping stu
dents negotiate the issues asso
ciated with alcohol consump
tion. For schools like Gettys
burg, single-issue answers—
like opting for a dry campus,
on the one hand, or arguing for
individual responsibility, on the
other—are not enough. Our
response must be more com
prehensive. Our response must
rely not on a single solution,
but on a combination of tech¬

ques.
First, we must continually
examine our environment, our
policies, practices, and behav
iors to determine what encour
ages responsible alcohol use
and what does not. Such evalu
ation cannot be left to college
administrators alone: students,
student organizations, faculty,
and alumni all need to become
involved in exploring and ad
dressing environmental ques
tions. Second, we must all take
more responsibility for creating
social options that do not re
volve around underage or ex¬

cessive alcohol use. To that end,
I have committed $50,000 this
semester to encourage student
initiated social activities. At a
recent Board of Trustees meet
ing, several students shared
their concerns about what they
believe is a limited range of
social options at Gettysburg.
My hope is that these new
funds will help broaden those
options, and encourage events
that don't center around drink
ing. These funds will be admin
istered by a special subcommit¬

tee of students operating under
the auspices of Student Senate.
Any student who has an idea
for a social event may apply for
funding from this subcommit
tee, which is chaired by Val
Katzmer and also includes
Mark Astrom, Rodwin Lowe,
Jen Gillette, Becca O'Connell,
and Marcello Ardun. In addi
tion, we have freed up the ball
room for several weekend
nights in the spring semester in
order to accommodate events
that might be held in that facil
ity.

Third, we should permit
legal and moderate consump
tion of alcohol in connection
with some College events. His
torically, since fraternities have
dominated the College's .social
scene, "they also' have domi
nated access to alcohol on cam
pus. Our current policies/tend
to discourage alcohol at Col
lege-sponsored events, thereby
driving all drinking (even legal
and moderate drinking) off
campus. This approach does
not allow for the effective mod
eling of responsible drinking by
upperclass students. This se
mester, we will pilot some Col
lege-sponsored events with al
cohol in order to help model
more appropriate drinking be
havior. Alcohol at these events
will be dispensed in accordance
with BYOB policies or with the
assistance of TIPS-trained serv¬

ers. Finally, we must chal
lenge Greek organizations on
this issue. While no one is pre
suming that alcohol abuse is a

"Greek problem," the presence
of Greek organizations is a fac
tor related to higher levels of
binge drinking on college cam
puses. A national study re
leased just before Christmas
indicates that fraternity and
sorority leaders have higher
rates of alcohol abuse than
members or non-members. We
all know how important the
peer group is in influencing stu
dent behavior. Fraternities and
sororities need to develop mea
surable ways to live up to val
ues in their charters stressing
academic achievement
and personal develop
ment. At this time of year, when

Rush and pledging are about to
begin, it is incumbent on all
who participate in the Greek
system to understand the dan
gers inherent in hazing, drink
ing games, and any Rush " event
in which alcohol is present,
whether on campus or off. I
must remind you in the stron
gest words , possible that such
activities will not be tolerated.
The four-year suspension of Phi
Delta Theta last year was due
to the combination of Rush,
alcohol, and drinking games,
which led to the hospitalization
of four students. We cannot—
and will not—^ tolerate such ac
tivities. We will continue to set
and enforce reasonable rules.

We have taken many
good steps and made good
progress in addressing this
problem. We must expand our
support for students who do
not drink, enhancing our com
mitment to substance-free
housing and similar programs.
We need to get serious about
providing alternative beverages
at all campus parties so that
those who don't choose to
drink don't have to. We must
continue our efforts to educate
our students about alcohol—in
wellness classes, in groups like
CHEERS and Bacchus, through
programs like this year's out
standing Alcohol Awareness
Week, and through programs in

To the Editor:
I am a weekly reader of
the Gettysburgian and also a
woman athlete on the campus.
Each week I look forward to
reading about how all of the
athletic teams are doing on
campus, not just the mens
teams. Ever since the begin
ning of the year such sports as
Volleyball, Women's Soccer,
and now Women's basketball
have been neglected by your
staff. The school did not even
know that the Women's Volley-

- continued from page 10 -
the residence halls. Finally,
we need to find effective
ways to talk about this issue
on campus. Numerous sur
veys show that the vast ma
jority of our students hold
very responsible opinions
about alcohol and its use. We
need to be more purposeful
about sharing this informa
tion in ways that will help
shape perceptions about
drinking norms.
This is an important is¬

sue, and inevitably there is
more to be done. I invite
your participation in our
ongoing conversation about
how we can best encourage
healthy discussion of this is
sue on campus and develop
appropriate behaviors in our
community. There is no is
sue that is of greater concern
to our alumni, our parents,
and our students. As recent
events have taught us, stu
dent alcohol abuse truly is a
matter of life and death.

ball team won the conference
and played in the NCAA tour
nament.
And now, the Women's
Basketball team is having the
best year in a long time and we
can't even be mentioned in the
NewsPaper. Tell me why two
months after the end of a ter
rible football season there is an
entire page dedicated to their
team? Do you know that the
women's basketball team is
now 11-3 and the men are 9-8,
but somehow that does not

make it in the news. Tell me
how we can get campus sup
port if our very own school
paper can not support us.
Please do not tell me that
you are low on staff members,
because obviously you have a
few too many if you have to
report on the changes being
made for the football team 8
months before they even play.
And why is it the paper can tell
the whole school intramural
scores and not the scores of its
own Women's basketball team.
I am not the only woman
who feels this way about the
neglection of women sports in
the Gettysburgian. I am writ
ing on behalf of my entire team
as well as many other women
athletes on this campus.
I do expect a response to
this message. I will not accept
the sexism to continue any
longer.

In elementary school, we

in the field of computer science
but also easy to be caught.
In a 100-level course,
some students found the only
way to complete projects was to
copy each other's assignments.
Like essays, even at the most
basic level, programs have a dis
tinctive style. Although in
stances are not as clearcut as the
average case of plagiarism, the
telltale signs of wrong doing are
blatant to a computer science
literate person.
The Honor Code is not
equipped to handle these kinds
of cases. The Honor Commis
sion has to confront the diffi
cult task of dealing with the
problems caused by technology

The Honor Commission
also faces the disapproval of the
faculty. The disheartening num
ber of violations each semester
lowers the faith the faculty puts
in the Honor Code. Some of
the major complaints concern
ing the honor system center
around the fact that the process
is slow, relies heavily on the
word of students, is inflexible
in the doling out of punish
ments, and is not reducing the
amount of cheating on campus.
While some would say
that only cheaters need an
Honor Code, others argue that
the honest people should desire
to uphold the Honor Code even
more. Side with the latter.

Conflict and Consensus
From The Donkey's Mouth

Judge not the man, but rather his policy

by Libby Main
Political Columnist
Should it matter if
Monica Lewinsky had a five
year affair with her high school
drama teacher? Should we be
lieve allegations that she had an
obsessive infatuation with the
president and that she told
people her goal was to have a
sexual relationship with him
before she became a White
House intern? Is Lewinsky's
credibility damaged because
she admitted to forging a let
ter from a college administra
tor offering a job to her lover?
Does the women who taped
phone conversations with
Lewinsky, Linda Tnpp, have

questionable motives because
she is connected to a Clinton
defaming publisher? What if
independent Council Kenneth
Star was involved in plans to
secretly wire Lewinsky before
Janet Reno authorized the ex
pansion of his investigation?
Despite the shadiness of
the information which has been
reported about Lewinsky re
cently, I frankly don't think the
answers to any of the above
questions matter. Neither do
the majority of Americans. A
CNN, USA Today, Gallop poll
that was conducted this past
weekend reported that Presi
dent Clinton's approval ratings
are the highest ever—69%,
which is also higher than

Ronald Reagan ever received.
(I say based on this information
let's re-name National Airport
after Bill rather than Ronnie).
In addition, 58% of
Americans feel that Kenneth
Starr should end his investiga
tion and as of last Friday he will
not be able to use Lewinsky's
testimony in the Paula Jones
lawsuit. This is because Judge
Susan Webber ordered all evi
dence related to Lewinsky be
excluded from the Jones pro
ceedings, making Jones case
less likely to hold up.
Despite the fact that these
sexual allegations against the
president have captured con
tinuous media attention, I
doubt that they will ever be re¬

corded as damaging and as dis
turbing as the Whiskey Ring,
Teapot Dome, Watergate and
Iran Contra Scandals in the his
tory books. These scandals in
volved political decisions
rather than the presidents per
sonal life. So while it is nice to
have a U.S. President who is a
moral role model, I think it is
far more important to have one
who is honest in the realm of
public and foreign policy. Be
sides, the British still loved and
respected Churchill despite the
fact that he reportedly held
meetings and greeting foreign
leaders in the nude.
Thus, the fact that these
allegations have taken attention
from President Clinton's State
nf fhe Union Address and an¬

nouncement of his balanced
budget proposal is the biggest
disappointment of the whole
situation. In the State of the
Union, Clinton took a more
moderate stance, claiming that
the era of big government is
over. Using money from to
bacco settlements, the new
budget contains proposals for
new teachers, more child care
money, more health care for
children of the working poor
and more health research dol
lars. Finally, the only questions
which I think are relevant to
this matter are related to how
much it is detracting from, and
effecting the day to day busi
ness of running the United
States.



Morality matters

by Cammie Grant
Political Columnist
President Bill Clinton de
livered his State of the Union
Address last Tuesday night.
Since then approval ratings
have been on a climb. In fact,
he has achieved the highest ap
proval ratings of his presidency,
according to a Time Magazine
poll. In his one hour and
twelve minute speech, Clinton
focussed on his successful ac
complishments and _encouraged
the voters to continue support
ing him. He did not focus on
Monica Lewinsky, but rather

on the future of Americans lives
and the future of our country.
To many Americans, the
approval ratings may come as
a surprise, particularly after his
alleged affair with Monica
Lewinsky. I for one, am
shocked. The public must be
captured by the artificial sincer
ity of Clinton. I will agree that
President Clinton, in times of
hardship, is at his best. In his
State of the Union address, he
came across as sincere and
pure, but is purity a good word
choice when describing our
president? How can we the
people trust and put the future

of our country in the hands of
a man who has been accused
of numerous affairs?
I will leave it to the vot
ers to answer these questions.
In a Time Magazine poll,
Americans believe that
Clinton's alleged affair with
Lewinsky was not conspired by
the conservatives. To the Re
publican party's credit, they
stayed out of the problem and
sat on the side lines watching
Hillary Clinton point her fin
ger in their direction.
Hillary deserves a pat on
the back for sticking up for her
hubby; after all, not every wife

would show such support and
faith in a husband accused
many times of engaging in ex
tra-marital affairs.
Perhaps many Americans
believe that the president's sex
life is personal, and has no rel
evance in assessing Clinton's
performance. Ask yourself,
what does lying under oath
mean, morally and ethically? If
he lied under oath, there
should be no question of resig
nation. In addition to, if he
encouraged Lewinsky to deny
their affair under oath, resig
nation should not be a ques
tion.

I must admit, it is a great
accomplishment for Mr.
Clinton to obtain the highest
ratings in all of his five-year
presidency, especially under the
circumstances. I do commend
our president, if it was from the
heart, for focussing on the fu
ture of America in his address.
If I were in his shoes, I would
be praying on my knees that
whoever else he has been in
volved with, if anyone, stays
quiet, at least through the re
mainder of his presidency.

The Pachyderm's Pulpit
Happy birthday Mr. President

by J ohn Dunlap
Political Columnist
This week the United
States honors the 87th birthday
of one of its greatest presidents,
Ronald Wilson Reagan. As
President Reagan suffers from
the pain of Alzheimer's Dis
ease, the United States will re
flect upon his life and accom
plishments. We have begun to
honor the work of the 40th
President of the United States
and his Administration. Across
America, bridges, buildings,
and highways are taking on his
name. The Congress will soon
vote on whether to rename
National Airport after Presi
dent Reagan as this great leader
is beginning to take his place
in history.

Despite what some in the
media and academia would
have you believe, Ronald
Reagan was one of the greatest
Presidents in our history. In my
personal opinion President
Reagan stands with George
Washington, Thomas Jefferson,
Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lin
coln, Theodore Roosevelt, and
Franklin Roosevelt as one of
the greatest men who have
served as the Republic's Com
mander in Chief.
When we look at our
most recent presidents, includ
ing our incumbent scandal rid
den Chief Executive, President
Reagan stands out as the

model. A key reason for his
success was that he was not a
career politician, the only eight
years he ever lived in Washing
ton, D.C. were those spent in
the White House. Ronald
Reagan was born into a poor
family in the heartland of
America, Tampico, Illinois.
"Dutch" as the future President
was called was raised in Dixon_,
Illinois and he attended a small
local College called Eureka
where he played football. Af
ter college, Ronald Reagan
would broadcast college foot
ball on a small radio station out
of Des Moines, Iowa. From
there he was able to get a job

with Warner Brothers, and was
off to Hollywood.
During World War II, Mr.
Reagan served in the army and
his acting career moved for
ward. Politically, he was a
Democrat who cast his first
four ballots for president for
F.D.R., and in 1948 cam
paigned for Harry Truman. As
President of the Screen Actors
Guild his concern over the
growing threat of Communism
began to alarm him. His fierce
determination to fight what he
considered an evil system led
him to head Democrats for
Eisenhower in 1952. By the
1960's President Reagan had
moved to the Republican party

and in 1964 he would
address the _^^^_fl

nation on behalf of the Repub
lican Presidential Nominee
Barry Goldwater. Goldwater
was defeated by President
Lyndon Johnson by a landslide
but it launched Ronald Reagan
into the Governorship of Cali
fornia two years later. Gover
nor Reagan cut taxes, balanced
the budget, and fought the pro
test against the Vietnam War.
The Governor was the titular
Conservative leader in the
United States and in 1968 he
received a great deal of support
for the GOP nomination for
President.
Ronald Reagan stood up

for his beliefs before anything
else and his determination
drove him to challenge the Re
publican President of the
United States, Gerald R. Ford.
Reagan took his campaign all
the way to the 1976 Republi
can National Convention.
Four years later he moved the
Republican Party to the right by
winning the party's presidential
nomination. President Jimmy
Carter ran a scare campaign to
defeat the former California
Governor but it failed as the
American people by a large
margin sent an actor to
the White _^^^
House. _^^^^^^^^^^ _m
Af- _^^^^_H_^^^

years
of tur
moil and
crisis, with
the assassina
tion of President
Kennedy, the race
riots and anti-

^^^_H War riots
_^^™ of the 1960's and
1970_'s, the
Watergate Scandal, and Jimmy
Carter's days of malaise, a new
leader known as the "Great
Communicator" gave the
United States hope and turned
the country around.
He gave us the greatest
tax cut in the history of the
United States, an act which re
duced unemployment. Infla
tion and interest rates dropped
and since the Reagan Presi
dency the United States has had
the longest period of economic
growth in our history. With
only a minor decline in the
early nineties our economy has
never stopped growing. Liber¬

als blame President Reagan for
the deficit but in the 1980's rev
enues tripled and the Demo
cratic Congress refused to vote
on his spending cuts. Today
President Clinton and the Re
publican Congress are balanc
ing the budget and cutting taxes
following the Reagan model
and it is working. In 1982
President Reagan along with a
bipartisan coalition saved social
security and in 1986 massive
tax reform was enacted under
his leadership.

_^^^^r
' work and the
J_^_r accomplish¬
ments are end
less. During his
eight years he ran the
country we saw parole at

the federal level abolished.
With the help of First Lady
Nancy Reagan the "Just Say
No" campaign dramatically
dropped drug use in America
and saved the lives of thou
sands of children. President
Reagan fought for free and fair
trade as the United States and
Canadian Free Trade Agree
ment was negotiated but when
Harley Davison was dying, his
leadership saved it with a pro
tective tariff. The president
always did what was right for
the American worker.

Out of all of his accom
plishments, Ronald Reagan's
fierce determination to defeat
what he called the "Evil Em
pire" stands out. He rebuilt our
military, increased defense
spending, and engaged in a se
cret war with the help of our
allies, including British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher
and Pope John Paul II, to de
stroy communism. Coming
into office President Reagan
knew communism was dying
but he wanted to speed up its
decline. In 1983, communism

began its retreat with the lib
eration of Grenada, which
freed American students. By
the late eighties the Soviets
were ready to come to the table
and when President Reagan
went to Berlin and declared,
"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this
wall," the Soviet General Sec
retary did just that. Millions
of people worldwide owe Presi
dent Reagan thier thanks as
nation after nation has been lib
erated from the evils of com
munism. The fact that a piece
of the Berlin Wall can stand
outside the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library in Simi
Valley, California, is evidence
of President Reagan's place in
history.
More than anything else.

President Reagan gave the
American people hope and they
thanked him for it in 1984 with
a landslide 49 state victory. He
always had a joke, and his hu
mor was a nice change of pace.
His ability to speak to the com
mon person and talk about his
agenda moved the whole coun
try rightward. Today, Bill
Clinton is moving the Demo
cratic Party to the center be
cause under Ronald Reagan the
left was blown out of the wa
ter. In 1988, Ronald Reagan's
Vice President and former op
ponent George Bush won the
Presidency on President
Reagan's coattails and in 1994,
a Republican Congress was
elected for the first time in forty
years carrying the Reagan ban¬

ner. To honor our 40th presi
dent, Ronald Reagan deserves
to be carved into Mount
Rushmore for the American
people always to be able to
honor him. He gave us hope
and restored our faith in our
Republic. He never let the
American people down and
they never let him down. We
owe President Reagan a great
thank you, so thanks to the
Gipper, for all you did for our
country and for my generation.

Dr. Sandra Fillebrown, St Joseph's
University, "Chaotic Dynamics - Or
When Is Close Good Enough?" A
quadratic function is easy to under
stand, right? Wrong! With the
seemingly innocent idea of iteration
(repeatedly applying function
composition), the quadratic function
goes from being a friendly little
parabola to being a showcase for
chaos. In this talk, we will look at the
dynamics of quadratic iteration and
develop the necessary background to
explain why in chaotic systems, close
is not usually good enough. ALL

"Staying on the right track": catch up with the Bullet track teams

by Nathan Grim and
Bryan Sentz
Contributing Reporters
The Bullets track and
field teams have begun 1998
full of anticipation for a ban
ner season. The women's
team is one of the largest in
recent memory, and returns
many key veterans that will
greatly contribute to its ef
forts to successfully defend
their title as Centennial
Conference champions.
On Sunday, January
18, a skeleton squad of the
men's and women's indoor
track teams competed at
Haverford College. For the
women, Beth Castagno took
first place in the high jump,
clearing 5'6" and tying the
school record.

Sophomore captain
Andi Thent tied for first in
the 55 meter dash (7.5) and
placed second in the 200
meter dash (28.0). Senior
captain Jackie Klug placed
third in the 55 meter high
hurdles (9.0) and Cathy
Spangler captured second
place in the shot put with a
throw of 33'1".
The men's squad also
turned in some solid perfor
mances. Senior captain
Bryan Sentz pole vaulted to
a personal record height of
13'8" that was good enough
for first place.
The men also were

well represented in the shotput
where Mitko Koburov had a
career best throw of 41'1.75"
which earned fifth place. The
shotput was won by Nathan
Grim who threw 5_T1.25" es
tablishing a new school record
and qualifying for nationals.
Last Sunday, February 1
while the rest of campus was
engrossed in preparations for
Groundhog Day, the Bullets
traveled north to Dickinson
College. This was the first meet
for the entire team and many
strong performances were
turned in.
First place finishers for
the women included Beth
Castagno in the high jump and
the 4x400 meter relay team of
Jackie Lumbra, Andi Therit,
Jackie Klug and Keri Hymen.
Emily Cerda placed second and
established a new school record
in the women's pole vault

(7_'0").
The 4x800 meter relay
team ran a strong race to finish
in third place. Other bronze
medalists for the Bullets were
Andi Therit in the 55 meter
dash (7.74), Keri Hymen in the
400 meter dash (65.15) and
Eileen Chazan in the200 meter
dash (27.76).
Molly O' Keefe took
fourth in the 1500 meters,
(5:42.64) as did Tracy
Swackhammer in the 800
meters, (2:34.93). The silver

meet, was awarded to first year
student Ken Hymen for her
stellar performances in the 400
meters and the 4x400 relay.
The men's squad was
highlighted by strong perfor
mances by Brendan Clark.
Brendan captured two second
place finishes in the 1500
meters, (4:11.95) and the 800
meters, (2:03.92). His efforts
earned him a share of the menis
silver spike award which was
shared with first year pole
vaulter Will Hannema.
Hannema had a personal
best performance with a vault

of 11'6". Bryan Sentz placed
second in the pole vault. The
Bullets also were well repre
sented in the 5000m where se
niors Jason Smith and James
Smith captured fourth
(17:10.1) and fifth (17:30.9),
respectively.
The men have also filled
some holes in their roster and
will be very competitive this
year (13 0) and third in the 200
meter (24.24). Nathan Grim
took first place in the shot put
and third in the 351b. weight
throw establishing a new
school record of 37' 9".

This Saturday the Bullets
travel to Franklin & Marshall

Olympic Spotlight

by Matthew Eisenberg
Asst. Sports Editor
With only a day until the
1998 Winter Olympics com
mence in Nagano, Japan, CBS
has come under fire by sports
writers and Olympic fans. The
problem is with the tape delay
and air times of certain events,
such as figure skating and ice
hockey. Since the time differ
ence is 14 hours the winners
will be known by the morning
talk shows. CBS will be airing
women's figure skating, the
main event of the winter
Olympics, at least 14 hours af
ter the fact. Most of America,
if they desire will know the re¬

sults by lunch.
The critics are not asking
CBS to make the Olympics for
North America, but there could
be some concessions made. If
they were to have some events
at 10 a.m. Japan time they would
be on at 8 p.m. here. They are
not asking for all events, they un
derstand that the Japanese work
days and pay upwards of $200
for tickets to the women's figure
skating finals.
The loser with the time dif
ference is the NHL. They have
made several concessions to al
low players to compete for their
nations. The hockey times are
all 12 a.m. or later, the benefits

of this situation for the NHL is
questionable. It seems that the
NHL is using Nagano as a trial
run for the 2002 Olympics in
Salt Lake City, Utah. If CBS
executives were smart, they
would have requested that
some of the hockey games be
played at 10 a.m.
The winners will
definately be men's alpine ski
ing, with all their events being
broadcast live. Tommy Moe
will be the American to watch.
He was the first American to
ever medal in two alpine
events. He won a gold and a
silver at the last Olympics in
Lillehammer, Norway. He has

been recovering from knee sur
gery and hopes to retain glory.
However, CBS will still
give excellent coverage overall
and their ratings will be higher
than the Super Bowl because of

photo courtesy of ESPNet Sportzone
the wider audience appeal of
figure skating. Most sports
writers agree that middle
America will continue to watch
events even if they know the
results.

Sports as Steve Sees it...

The nation gears up for UNC -DUKE

by Steve Jenkins
Sports Editor
It has finally arrived. No,
it is not time for the return the
footlong hot-dog at servo, nor
have the Spice Girls finally de
cided to kick back and bear it
all. Finally it is time for the
match-up we have been salivat
ing over for weeks. Duke ver
sus North Carolina.
Duke and North Carolina
held the top two spots in The
Associated Press' college bas
ketball poll Monday, setting up
a No. 1 vs. No. 2 matchup this
week. The Blue Devils (20-1),
who stayed in the No. 1 spot
for the third straight week, will
play at North Carolina (22-1)
on Thursday night in the 14th
meeting of the poll's top two
teams since 1980.

The game will be broad
cast live by ESPN2 at 9 p.m.
ET. The last 1-2 matchup was
Kentucky's win over No. 1

Massachusetts in the 1996 Fi
nal Four. The last regular-sea
son matchup was between
Duke and North Carolina on
Feb. 3, 1994, an 89-78 victory
for the second-ranked Tar
Heels. Duke received 54 first
place votes and 1,734 points
from the national media panel,
41 more than North Carolina,
which was No. 1 on 16 ballots.
However, Thursday you
can flush all the ballots and all
the votes right down the
_perverbial toilet. It is going to
be Duke's best five against
UNC's best for forty minutes
and that is all.
Who will win? Will it be
the Duke Blue Devils and the
composure of Coach Mike
Krewjewski, or will it be the
run and gun, in your face style
of coach Bill Guthendge.

If both teams bring their
best games and their best play
tonight, it will be a battle for
the ages. UNC stars Vince

Carter, Antawn Jamison, and
Ed Cota will look to pummel
the Duke standouts; namely,
Steve Wojcieowski, Trajan
Langdon, and Rickey Price.
Duke is like a man smok
ing a cigarette by a gas station;
they are blowing up. They
have lonly lost one game this
year to defending national
champion Arizona, and have
tortured their ACC foes by con
siderable margins.
UNC also only has one
loss, and has what many ex
perts consider two of the most
explosive players in college bas
ketball in Jamison, and Carter.
Both of these players for UNC
have dominated Atlantic Coast
Conference oppponents and
have showed that they have the
skills to shine at the NBA level
as well.

Beckler & Burzio

The swim teams' "Killer B 's "

by Chistopher Bowman
B.A.S.S/Contributing Writer
Picture this: a blonde
haired little girl diving into the
pool at the country club. This
was how the swimming career
of Liz Burzio began. Liz, at the
age of 20, is a sophomore ma
joring in political science. She
comes to Gettysburg from her
hometown, Potomac, Mary
land. Liz has one younger sis
ter, age 17, who surprisingly
did not follow in the footsteps
of her older sister. The most
enjoyable aspects of swimming
for Liz include the friendships
that she has made over the
years, as well as two trips to
Barbados with the college swim
feam

Liz feels that through
swimming she has really been
able to have a lot of fun, and
meet a lot of people, some of
whom she has grown quite
close to. The country club pool
was just the beginning for Liz.
Soon after she began to com
pete in the summer leagues, her
coach encouraged her to con
tinue swimming throughout
the winter, in order to make her
that much better for the com
mencement of the summer sea¬

son. Throughout her career,
and still to this day, she com
petes in the 200m and 100m

backstroke, 200m individual
medley, and 400m and 200m
medley relay. The fondest
memory for Liz was at the age
of 12, when she maintained an
undefeated record throughout
the County Championship,
where her team finished first
overall, and she obtained the
highest overall point total for
an individual.
Liz also told me that one
of the reasons she is still swim
ming in college is because of
her coach, Mr. Mike Rawleigh.
She says, "He just makes it easy
for me to still want to swim."
Coach Rawleigh helps to cre
ate a fun, and hard working
atmosphere for his athletes,
which has enabled the swim
team to produce such a tremen
dous winning record over the
years. Liz Burzio is obviously
not a stranger to the water, and
neither is her friend, and team
mate, Mark Beckler.

Mark also started at a
young age, in his hometown of
Merchantville, New Jersey,
only he has Liz beat by three
years. Mark also grew up
around the water, spending his
summers at the swim club.
Mark felt that at the age
of four he was perfectly ready
for competitive swimming, and
decided to meet this challenge
the following summer, as he
joined the swim team at the age

Pholo By Emily Giatfelter
This Bullet swimmer has gotten out quick and is lengths past the competition.

of five. He hasn't stopped since
then, and plans to finish his
college career. He competes in
the events of 200m and 100m
breaststroke, 500m freestyle,
and 400m and 200m individual
medley.
Mark said that it defi
nitely isn't easy, but to help
keep swimming interesting, he
also participated in soccer,
starting at age six, and continu
ing through high school.
Though swimming is hard

work, Mark looks forward to
forming new friendships each
season, and loves to travel. He
also likes the fact that it helps
to keep him in good physical
condition.
Mark told me that his
most memorable moment
would have to have been when
he qualified for YMCA Nation
als during his junior year in
high school with a broken arm.
He still to this day feels
that he has never swum faster.

Mark loves to compete, and
accepts the challenges which
swimming present, which to
him has just become a part of
his life.
On top of this, Mark has
declared a major in Biochem
istry and Molecular Biology. As
you can see, if you stop by the
pool every now and then, the
many long years of hard work
and determination have paid
off for both of these talented
young athletes.


Women swimmers on top again

from Centennial Conference
Press Release Gettysburg remains on
top of the conference stand
ings with perfect records as the
women's swimming team
swept two more meets last
week. With the most recent

lets are 6-0 in the Conference
and 7-0 overall.
Gettysburg easily de
feated Western Maryland, 70-

19, and Swarthmore, 133-72.
Megan Lewis took the

Karin Olmstead and
Kelly Brennan were both

Staff Reporter The Lady Bullets had
their six-game winning streak
snapped Tuesday when they
lost to Franklin &c Marshall,
70-55.
Playing in their fourth
game without the leading
rebounder, Megan Malloy, the
Lady Bullets struggled on the
boards, being out rebounded
by the Diplomats, 43-30. Judy
Stauber and Jen Gibbon led F
&C M with nine rebounds
apiece.
The Lady Bullets jumped
out to a 29-28 halftime lead

two first-half treys to put the
Lady Bullets ahead.

The Lady Bullets held on
to the one-point lead, 46-45,
with 9:48 remaining. The
Bullets then hit a power out
age going scoreless until the
4:06 mark when Megan
McDonald hit a jumper.
It was a little too late for
the Bullets because the Diplo
mats had gone on a 12-0 run
during the dry spell to jump
out to a 57-46 lead.

McDonald led the Bullets
with 16 points, while Dawson
poured in 10 more. Rachael

10 points in the first five min
utes of the half.
The Lady Bullets opened
up a 12 point lead on a three
point play by Carrie Kulp with
11:56 left to play and survived
a late rally by the Shorewomen
to earn the victory.

the gap to 62-58 with 4:24 re
maining, but the Bullets hit 8 of
11 free throws to ice the game.

Getting into the thick of things

Boys Basketball
From Staff Reports
He has started in just six
games, but already 6'5" fresh
man Greg Schreiber has been a
dominating factor in the Get
tysburg College men's basket
ball sucess.
Getysburg is 10-8 with a
three game win streak and is 4
3 in the Centennial Confer
ence. A pair of wins this week
against Franklin and Marshall,
Wed. (Feb 4) and another vic
tory over Dickinson (Feb. 7)
would put the Bullets right in

heads into the meat
the thick of the conference's
western division race.
Because of his 18 points
and 15 rebounds in a win over
Alvernia, and an 18 point and
eight rebound performance in
a win over Swarthmore,
Schreiber was named the
ECAC rookie of the week.
Those performance pushed
him right in the middle of the
race for team leadership.
Schreiber is currently av
eraging 10.4 points per game
and leads the team with a 4.6
rebound average. Not only is
his scoring and baord work

. of the season
improving but he has also
jumped to the head of the team
in shooting percentage; a re
markable 62.1 percent.
With sophomores Bill
Davidson and Richie Phiel fully
recovered from injuries, Gettys
burg is playing at full strength.
Head Coach George Petrie has
been starting Kevin Carroll and
Jon Bowman in the backcourt
with Schreiber, Pfeil and Terry

TKE denied
College loan

Haaland "not confident in their ability
to function as a fraternity"

class," said Smith. "Our GPA went up a
good deal. . . and we stayed out of
trouble," he said. According to Smith,
Haaland "decided to go ahead without
looking" at the new class and the GPA.
"I'm not confident of their ability
to function well as a fraternity at this
point," said Haaland. "I want them to
take more time to demonstrate that they
can be an appropriately functioning

The President of the Alumni
Board of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity,
which was closed down last spring due
to damages caused to the house by
brothers of the fraternity, has written a
letter to Gordon A. Haaland, President
of the College, to reconsider his deci
sion to deny the loan to the fraternity
to renovate.
"President Haaland deferred his
decision to make the loan until Decem
ber of 1998," said Dennis M. Murphy,
College Life. "It was too soon to tell
whether TKE was headed as a positive
contributor to Gettysburg life."
"I didn't think that TKE was ready
as a fraternity to participate in our loan
program," said Haaland.
Daniel Smith, President of Tau
Kappa Epsilon said that Haaland had
"promised to wait after rush."
"He was supposed tq wait and see
the pledge class and our GPA," said
Smith. Haaland decided a "bit earlier,"
he added.

Tau Kappa Epsilon was expected
to improve their GPA, maintain a high
behavior standard, and "recruit a strong
and diverse pledge class," said Murphy.
There are the "same issues that they are
recruiting the same Athletic team," he
said. "We feel we got a large diverse

Staff Reporter

organization."
"Another year would enable us to
determine the direction TKE is
heading,"said Murphy. "We are saying
to TKE to not to plan on staying in their
house and go through the hosing pro
cess." Tau Kappa Epsilon members plan
to live in their house next semester.
"Our board is trying to look at other
means," said Smith. "We are currently
looking at outside financial institu
tions."
If the loan is approved, the col
lege could provide up to $300,000 pro
vided the fraternity raises at least
$100,000. "The exact amount of the
loan is negotiated based on the nature
of the project," said Haaland.
The fraternity Alumni Board is
currently negotiating with Haaland. In
the interim, members of the fraternity
attended a retreat at a Manor in
Taneytown, Maryland, "as a group to
go over about our formal evaluations,"
said Smith.

$50,000 result of increased enrollment

by Keith Davis
Staff Reporter Many students question
the source behind the funding
of the Student Life Committee.
The $50,000 given to the
SLC by the administration is a
direct result of the increased
enrollment of first year stu
dents in the fall of 1997, ac
cording to President Haaland.
"The money basically
comes from more students en
rolled than we had budgeted
for," Haaland said.
The extra money avail
able is used as a contingency.
Because of the desire to im
prove social outlets for students
by both the student body and
the administration, the possi
bility for improvement became
more tangible. The available
desire and money lead to the
creation of the SLC experi¬

. "It was a spontaneous
decision but was made in con
junction with a lot of thinking
about the College's social life,"
Haaland.

President Haaland spoke
of the dilemma the administra
tion and some students, now
members of the SLC faced in a
forum. This forum met at the
end of last semester to discuss
the problems of social life for
students. According to
Haaland, the dilemmas faced
were rooted in the design of
current social activities. He
states that the are a lot of op
tions currently available such as,
readings, musical performances
and so forth but mentioned the

conflict between these events
and the diversity of students.
"The students are very
diverse and some activities are
just not designed for them," he
said. The SLC is responsible
for allocating the $50,000 to
groups interested in sponsoring
events for the entire campus.
There are a certain criteria the
committee will follow. Because
the committee of students is an
experiment its direction is not
yet known. The administration
has given no guarantee that

funding will continue into fu
ture semesters, however both
President Haaland and Dean
Ramsey are confident that SLC

will be successful.
"If it is successful, we will
do the best to keep it going,"
Haaland said.

Charusheela, these sidebars
were intended to stop export
ers from exploiting child labor.
During her presentation,
Charusheela will discuss
whether these sidebars "help or
hurt the group they are sup
posed to be protecting - the
abused children." She will also
examine possible alternatives
to, existing legislation that she
hopes might "ensure that the
children and the poor are
helped, rather than hurt by our
legislative efforts."

According to Jan Pow
ers, adjunct associate professor
of interdepartmental studies
and coordinator of this year's
Area Studies Symposium, hu
man rights groups in the United
States have been at odds over
the question of whether child
labor is essential for the sur
vival of poor families in South
Asia, even though children's
health and safety are endan
gered by long working hours,
lack of schooling, and danger
ous worksites.

Sabres, rifles, and smiles

by Cara Masucci
Staff Reporter There are many different
activities and clubs on campus
that offer a wide variety of cul
tural experiences. The newly
founded Indoor Color Guard
is one of them. With sabres,
rifles, flags, and intricate dance
moves, the nine members at
tempt to capture beauty and
grace at its finest.
Indoor Color Guard is a
relatively new activity on cam
pus, drawing heavily upon the
initiative of several persistent
young women.
An extension of the Out
door Color Guard in the fall,
cofounders Clair Roberts and
Maureen Miller, Melanie
Milburn, Melodie Foster,
Mandi Latronica, Christina
Dickert, Kristin O'Neill, Laura
Fairbairn, and Katy Roy have
put forth a tremendous effort
to get this activity off the
ground this semester.

Color Guard itself is the
highly skilled performance
group of eight to fifteen mem
bers. It involves choreograph
ing moves and tosses of flags,
sabres, and rifles to a variety of
different types of music.
A performance based
upon interpretation, color
guard allows for a huge expres
sion of individuality and inten
sity by the performers, accord
ing to president Maureen
Miller.
This, the first year for the
Gettysburg College Indoor
Color Guard, has been a build
ing experience. Miller, a jun
ior, and Roberts, a first year
student, both came from very
competitive high school teams.
The rest of the team has

varying levels of experience.
What is really great is how they
are willing to work together,
says Miller.
Speaking to Miller, it be
came very clear how much of
effort has been put into the rou
tine. At the beginning of the
semester, the guard had two

grueling nine hour practice ses
sions where they learned the
basics of the performance.
Since then, they have
been practicing four hours a
week with an optional practice
for those who feel they need
to work on their technique.

The
women are very
con
cerned
with the
precision and ex
ecution of
their

moves.
Both Miller and Rob
erts com
mented
on the im
portance of timing,
and work
ing to
gether.
Ev
erything
has to be
exact for
the show
to be a
hit. That
takes a lot
of effort
on the
part of ev
eryone in
volved.

can mes appear
easier than they really are, but
there are things people do not
realize about the motions.
Some technical aspects include
posture and the positioning of
hands for tosses and spins.
Miller was quick to point
out that she was really happy
with how things were develop
ing. "I'm really proud of ev
eryone, and it's a lot of fun
when there are moments that

everything comes together."
For the newly formed In
door Color Guard, individual
ity and expression takes the
theme of Celtic Nights. Com
bining a very Irish selection of
music and a series of intricately
designed dance moves, the

theme burns throughout the
show. The group decided on the
Celtic theme because, according
to Roberts, they wanted to
make it beautiful. "It [color
guard] is an art form." The
music is full of passion, inten
sity, and radiance, much like the
art form itself.
Miller and Roberts wrote
the routine over winter break,
and Milburn (the choreogra¬

pher) helped iron out the rough
edges. The women used their
own experience in high school
color guard as a basis for teach
ing and instructing the other
members.
As Mandi Latronica,
whose mother made the flags

said, "It's amaz
ing that we put
this together as
kids." It has not
been an easy
battle, though.
Between gruel
ing practices
and having to go
out and find
their own equip
ment, the girls
know the real
meaning of hard
work. Over va
cation, and even

through their
season, the team
has devoted
much time to
making and fix
ing old equip
ment for the
routine. The
team also sets up
and takes down
their equipment
during the per
formances, since
they are given
only so much
time to get on
and off the
floor.

The group
is quick to point
out that the

campus community has been
very supportive of their efforts.
Earlier this year, Student Sen
ate allotted $500 to the guard.
Miller was enthusiastic about
the money and recognition the
team will be receiving from
Senate at the beginning of next
year. "Campus support means
so much to us," Miller said.
"We [perform] for the cam
pus."

The Indoor Color Guard
will be performing for the cam
pus on Wednesday, February
18th, at halftime of the men's
varsity basketball game. Gear
ing up for that performance, on
Saturday the women will travel
to Philadelphia for a competi
tion. The team will perform
against at least fifteen other
guards.
They would also like to
perform on campus again dur
ing Get Acquainted Day, and
another as yet unspecified per
formance.
One of the team's main
goals, outside of performing,
has been to boost membership
and interest in the organiza
tion. The women are very ea
ger to point out that the Indoor
Color Guard is something any
one can join.

It is not necessary to have
previous experience, one needs
only dedication and the willing
ness to work hard. The women
would like to expand the color
guard to include men as well.
Anyone interested in join
ing need not wait until next
fall. It is possible, according to
Robert and Miller, to come and
practice with the team.
While it might be too late
to compete, there are advan
tages to having a semester more
of training. That way, the
whole process can become
quite cyclical. If one were in
terested, he or she should con
tact Maureen Miller or Clair
Roberts.
The Indoor Color Guard
members are quite excited
about the future. Prospects for
success look good, and like the
Dance Ensemble, the guard
hopes to become an integral
part of campus life.

The hard work should
pay off, and from the laughs
and smiles at practices, the nine
women have gained a sense of
accomplishment and achieve
ment from laying the founda
tion for the Indoor Color
Guard, not to mention a feel
ing of fun.



Beware the
"Grim Reefer"

Valentine's Day for the lonely

by Kyle Heulitt
GECO Columnist

For years, people have
been awed by the beaury of
coral reefs. Aside from their
aesthetic appeal, coral reefs
give rise to a very complex and
diverse ecosystem, and provide
an ideal habitat for many or
ganisms. Unfortunately,
throughout the world, coral
reefs are being threatened by
human activity.
Reefs occur around the
world in clear, shallow, tropi
cal waters. Over thousands of
years, they are built up by tiny
coral animals called polyps,
which are aided by minute al
gae called zooxanthellae that
live in their tissue. Biologically,
coral reefs are the second most
productive systems in the
world after tropical rainforests.
Although they cover only one
percent of the earth's surface,
they are home to twenty-five
percent of all marine fish.
Reefs are also a potential
source for new medicines.

Chemical compounds from
tropical reef organisms show
promise of being effective
against diseases such as arthri
tis, cancer, and AIDS.
Threats to the reefs have
never been greater than they
are today. Their ecosystems are
disturbed by commercial fish
ing and harvesting of valuable
species, mining of reef lime
stone for building materials,
pollution and sedimentation
caused by deforestation, and
excessive coastal development.
Disease and damage from
pollution has wiped out huge

areas of the Florida Reef Tract,
the third largest coral reef sys
tem in the world, as well as in
parts of the Caribbean and
Asia. An increase in phospho
rous and nitrogen levels due to
human waste and agricultural
run-off has caused life-destroy
ing algal blooms, covering the
coral and killing it. Careless
anchoring and accidental boat
groundings have also de
stroyed years of coral growth
in minutes.
Experts also agree that if
reefs are to be preserved, the
sale, importation, and harvest
ing of corals must end. In third
world countries, thousands of
tons of living corals are being
ripped from the reef by cranes
and sold in foreign markets,
notably the U.S.

Worldwide, approxi
mately ten percent of all reefs
have degraded beyond recov
ery, and if current practices go
unchecked, it is estimated that
twenty to thirty percent of the
resource could be destroyed
within the next ten to twenty
years. Fortunately, many
threats to coral reefs are re
versible and preventable, but
we must act before any more
damage is done. If we do not,
we will have destroyed in mere
decades what it took thousands
of years to create.

Saturday is the big day, and the card and candy makers will not let us forget it.
There is a large number of people out there who think that Valentine's Day should be
wiped off the calendar forever. Obviously, we are the people who do not have a "signifi
cant other" (s.o.) this Valentine's Day. Valentine's Day was a happy day until about
fourth grade, when we stopped exchanging valentines with everyone in our class. For us,
it is now a day of pure misery, when our lack of a boyfriend/girlfriend is clearly shown.
Unfortunately for us, this year, the big V-Day falls on a Saturday. So what do we do this
Saturday night, without someone special to share it with? Here's a list that I've come up
with (with the help of my many single friends).
1. Sit in your room with some Ben &C Jerry's and cry.
2. Pretend it's just any other day and conduct business as usual.
3. Hit on every guy/girl/farm animal you see in hopes of getting a s.o. by the end of
the evening.

4. (Over 21) Go to JD's and get wasted
(Under 21) Goto LD's and just be happy
5. Hang out with other people who don't have a s.o.
6. Crash someone else's date
7. Send yourself roses.
8. Listen to sappy music.
9. Read a trashy romance novel.
10. Call the psychic hotline.
11. Write a nasty letter to an ex.
12. Flirt with someone on the Internet.
13. Think up evil sayings for those little candy hearts.
14. Send evil valentines to people.
15. Watch romantic comedies and boo at the end.
16. Watch tragic love stories and cheer at the end.
17. Leave town and spend the night in a cave.
18. One word: Chocolate.
19. Go see Titanic—you're going to have to eventually anyway. If it's not at the
Majestic, I'm sure it's somewhere within driving distance.
20. Make hearts out of red construction paper and burn them with a few close
friends.

Contributing Reporters
One in four college
women...
• survive rape (15%) or
attempted rape (12%).
• 84% of survivors knew
their attacker.
• 57% of rapes happen
on dates.
• 75% of the men and
55% of the women involved in
acquaintance rapes were drink
ing or taking drugs just before
the attack.
• 41% of college women
who are raped were virgins at
the time.
• 70% of rape survivors
physically resisted the rape in
some manner.

• 92% of the time when
a woman reports a rape, she's
telling the truth.
• 84% of rape survivors
tried unsuccessfully to reason
with the man who raped her.
In the last half of 1995,
432,700 incidents of rape, at
tempted rape, and sexual as
sault, happened to women in
the United States. This
amounts to 99 women every
hour. • 42% of rape survivors
told no one about the rape.
• 42% of rape victims
had sex again with the rapist.
• 41% of women who are
raped expect to be raped again.

• 30% of rape victims
contemplate suicide after the
rape. • 84% of men who com
mitted rape said that what they
did was definitely not rape.
• 55% of gang rapes on
college campuses are done by
fraternities, 40% by sports
teams, 5% by others.
• 35% of men report
some likelihood that they
would rape if they could be as
sured thy would not be caught.
Women who are raped
define their experience as such:
1/4 define it as rape, 1/4 think
it was a crime but did not know
it was rape, 1/4 believed it was
serious sexual abuse but did not
know it was a crime, 1/4 did
not feel victimized by the ex
perience.

Rape is common world
wide, with 19%-28% of col
lege women reporting rape or
attempted rape all over the
world. In many countries,
women are treated far worse
than in the United States.
Statistics were taken from
John D. Foubert's "The Men's
Program: 'How to Help a
Sexual Assault Survivor: What
Men Can Do."
These may be difficult
facts to accept, but they are
facts. Rape can happen to any
one: friend, family member, co
worker, or peer - male or fe
male. However, in 99% of all
rapes or attempted rapes

women are the victims. Yes,
rape occurs on the small cam
pus of Gettysburg College, as
it is a problem on every college
campus.
If someone who is close
to you is a recent survivor, here
are some ways that you can
help: 1. Tend to her needs.
Make sure both her medical
and emotional needs are met.
Be sure that she can feel safe.
2. No More Violence.
Saying that you are going to
beat him up is usually the last
thing she wants to hear. The
best advice is to let her know
you are upset that this hap
pened to her and that you will
do anything to help her re
cover.

3. Comfort her. What
she does need from you is to
be comforted. Let her be in
charge - she may want a hug,
some don't want to be touched.
4. Listen. Don't ask for
details. Don't suggest why it
happened. Listen to what she
wants to say, and don't judge
her. 5. Believe her. The single
most important factor in recov
ery is whether or not she is be
lieved. There is a 92% chance
she's telling the truth.
6. Give her control. Get
her to make small decisions,
whether about a restaurant or
a soda. Accept her decisions
even if you don't agree. Be

patient, it will take her a long
time to decide.
7. Realize limitations.
Victims often remain in acute
trauma for three months. One
year recovery time is common,
even with counseling, and some
take years.
Refer the rape victim to
counseling!
Don't talk to the survivor
about your own feelings, but do
talk to others. If you are over
whelmed, get counseling for
yourself.
We are fortunate at
Gettysburg to have a number
of resources for survivors. En
courage the survivor to get the
medical attention that they
need as well as the crucial coun
seling she needs.
• Health Center (x6972)
• Gettysburg Hospital
(334-2121 or 334-0468)
• Counseling Center
(x6960)
• Crisis Intervention

(334-2121)
• Survivors (334-9777)
If the individual wants to
report the rape, call Security
(x6911) or the Borough Police
(334-1168).
If you are a survivor, you
are not alone. One in four. . .
look around.
All-male peer education
programs are the most effective
means to change men's atti
tudes toward rape. If you are
interested in taking part in such

a group, contact Dennis
Murphy (his office is in the
CUB, in the Office of Student
Activities, or e-mail him at
dmurphy). EARN
$750-$1500/Week
Raise all the money your
student group needs by
sponsoring a VISA Fundraiser
on your campus. No invest
ment and very little time
needed. There's no
obligation, so why not call for
information today.

Blues redux
All the music; few of the laughs

Reel Hits & Misses

by Dan Larkin and Mike Petro
Movie Columnists
Mike: Jake's dead, and
Elwood is back to bring the
world the blues. That is, Dan
Aykroyd and John Landis have
teamed up to bring the Blues
Brothers back to the big screen.
Dan: To be honest, the
very idea of resurrecting this
classic of American comedy
without John Belushi is some
thing close to blasphemy. De
spite this, I still tried to enter

Blues Brothers 2000 with a
relatively open mind. I'm re
ally not sure why I bothered.
In BB2K, Jake has passed
on to that big gig in the sky,
and Elwood is left to face the
world on his own. So as you
may very well guess, he does
the only thing he knows how
to do: he buys an old police car
from a surplus yard owned by
aspiring musician Malvern
Gasperon (B.B. King), and sets
about "getting the band back
together."

What follows is more in
tune with a remake than a se
quel. Elwood, played by a sig
nificantly slimmer Dan
Aykroyd (Dragnet), teams up
with some new "brothers":

Mighty Mack, the replacement
big guy, played by John
Goodman (Barton Fink), Cabel
"Cab" Chamberlain, played by
Joe Morton (Terminator 2),
and Buster, played by J. Evan
Bonifant (3 Ninjas Kick Back).
As a general rule, Dan
Aykroyd is only funny when he
teams up with someone else
who can carry the comedic
weight (i.e. Belushi in the origi
nal Blues Brothers, Bill Murray
in Ghostbusters, Eddie Murphy
in Trading PlacesJ. In BB2K,
Aykroyd has to carry the entire
movie on his shoulders, and it
just doesn't work.
The only laughs the movie
provides come more from a rec
ognition factor than actual
comedy, as the sequel revisits
the original ad nauseam.
Goodman, who is capable of
excellent comedic perfor
mances, is not an asset here.

As Elwood and his new
found "family" set about to
find the scattered band, they
become the focus of a state to
state police chase, upset the
Russian mafia, and enrage
some right-wing militia mem
bers. Sound familiar?
This is a movie that never
should have been revived. The

biggest indicator of a franchise
showing its age and lack of en
ergy is the addition of an obnox
ious little kid. Buster's addition
to the cast is reminiscent of the
introduction of Oliver to the
Brady Bunch in its last season
after Bobby and Cindy weren't
as cute as they used to be. While
he may not be as annoying as
Oliver, Buster is yet another of
the many strikes against BB2K.
Let me be honest with
everyone. This movie's plot is
terrible. The first Blues Broth
ers became a revered cult hit
because it is genuinely funny
throughout the movie, and it
had an unbelievable cast. This
movie's plot is not funny, and I
found it lacking energy.
Lacking a certain energy
is putting it mildly to say the
least. BB2K goes through the
motions, duplicating the plot of
the original, minus most of the
laughs. The best example of this
can be seen in the car chase

scenes, which attempt to repli
cate some of the fun of the first
movie, but fall so short of their
mark that one wonders why the
film's creators even bothered.
HOWEVER, this movie
flat out blows away the first
when it comes to music. With

the exception of Aretha
Franklin singing "Respect" to
Matt "Guitar" Murphy, all the
songs are different from the
original movie.
Furthermore, the talent
overflows in this movie.
Aykroyd, Goodman, Bonifant,
and Morton are all solid, but
it is the entire band that really
rocks this movie. Even beyond
the Blues Brothers band itself,
we see other music greats such
as James Brown, Wilson
Pickett, Johnny Lang, Blues
Traveller, and much more than

my knowledge of music allows
me to even recognize.
The best scene in this
movie comes at the end when
the Blues Brothers enter a
battle of the bands against the
Louisiana Gator Boys at
Queen Mousette's, a voodoo
club. Queen Mousette
(Erykah Badu) obviously has
an eye for talent because the
Gator Boys consist of Eric
Clapton, B.B. King, Bo
Diddley, Isaac Hayes, Dr.
John, Billy Preston, Lou
Rawls, Travis Tritt, and Steve
Winwood.

I needn't tell you what
kind of performance they put
on. But I will say this, in a year

when Puff Daddy sells millions
of records for stealing-oops
sorry-"sampling" from every
one under the sun, it was a fan
tastic experience to see and
hear master musicians practice
their craft.
In Puff's defense, he
doesn't strictly sample, but re
record and .update classic
grooves for a new audience
(which, I suppose, is what
Aykroyd and Landis are at
tempting to do with this se
quel). But I digress.
Yeah, the music is good.
But I went to see this movie
hoping to be entertained. What
I got instead is a tepid remake
of a movie that should have
been allowed to rest in peace.
People shouldn't waste
their time or money on this tur
key. For the music, I give this
one star (out of five). If you
want to hear the music, I sug
gest you buy the soundtrack.

I was disappointed that
this installment of the Blues
Brothers didn't make me laugh
as much as the first did. How
ever, the music really impressed
me. I give this movie two and
a half stars out of five. The
movie is the music, and the
music makes it worth seeing.

Happy drives
laughter home

by Eileen O'Donnell
Movie Columnist

Finally, someone has
made golf fun again. Adam
Sandier is hilarious starring in
Happy Gilmore, the best golf
movie since Caddyshack.
Ever since he learned to
skate, Happy Gilmore
(Sandier) has wanted to be a
hockey player. He holds two
junior hockey records: most
minutes spent in the penalty
box, and for being the first
person to take off his skate
and try to stab someone.
Since graduation, Happy has
been working odd jobs be
tween hockey tryouts. After
being passed over again,
Happy's life takes a strange

. Happy's grandmother,
who raised him after his fa
ther was killed by a Terry
O'Reilly slap-shot at a Bruins
hockey game, has had her
home repossessed by the IRS.
After winning a long-drive bet
with the movers, Happy sees
a way to make the $270,000
he needs to buy back the
house his grandfather built.
With his hot temper,
Happy doesn't seem like your
typical placid golfer. With
Chubbs Peterson (Carl Weath
ers) as his coach, Happy wins
a spot on the pro tour. On
the pro tour, Happy battles
Bob Barker and an alligator,

and falls in love with the tour's
PR agent (Julie Bowen). With
her help, Happy will try to beat
the arrogant tour favorite,
Shooter McGavin (Christopher
McDonald).
Sandler's brand of comedy
is one of a kind. In Happy
Gilmore he has the ability to
please all kinds of audiences,
young and old, with his antics
and running commentary about
the "sport" of golf.
Sandler's performance is
bolstered by his supporting cast,
which includes evil nurse Ben
Stiller {Reality Bites), construc
tion foreman Richard Kiel, and

existential golfer Kevin Nealon.
Since leaving Saturday
Night Live, Sandler's career has
skyrocketed. He was a very
popular cast member, playing
such roles as "Opera Man" and
the obsessive host of "The
Denise Show." By the time
Happy Gilmore was released in
1996, Sandier had already re
leased two comedy albums, and
had starred in Billy Madison and
Airheads with Brendan Fraser
(George of the Jungle). Late last
year he released his third album,
What's Your Name?, as well as a
new rendition of the ever-popu
lar "Chanukah Sons."

Sandier currently stars in
The Wedding Singer, which will
be released tomorrow. If it's any
thing like Sandler's other cin
ematic efforts, it will be a defi
nite hif.

Conflict and Consensus

by Christina Dickert
Columnist Welcome to my first col
umn. My apologies to the fans
of political columns, but this
column is definitely not about
the leaders of our land. Actu
ally, it's not really about any
thing. Before Jerry Seinfeld's
lawyers come after me for roy
alties (What would I give them?
My tuition bill?), I'll admit that
this column will have some sort
of topic every time it appears.
What sort of topic? That, my
friends, will be decided a few
hours before it is written. Now
that you know where I am com
ing from, on with the show.
"Shut up. Just shut up.
You had me at hello. (Sniffle.)

You had me at hello."
Even if you hate Tom
Cruise or haven't seen Jerry
Maguire a hundred times, you
know that these words are ut
tered at the end of the movie's
theme song, "Secret Garden."
I don't think that Tom Cruise
is the best actor in the world
(Sorry all you Tom fans out
there!!), but I admit that I know
ever single spoken word in that
song. Even though it is so
cheesy, that song is sacred to
me. It will forever be in my
memory from my high school
days. Picture this: A group of
high school seniors are driving
around on a Friday or Saturday
night when this song comes on
the radio. They all scream the
words at the top of their lungs
with enough emotion for six

drama departments, like they
were Dorothy Boyd with Jerry
Maguire sitting right next to
them. So, when I hear the new
"remixed" version of Celine
Dion's "The Heart Does Go
On" with the neat little twist
of words added from the
movie, it makes me want to lis
ten to Englebert Humperdink.
"Secret Garden" was an acci
dent, folks. Some DJ thought
that it would be cool if he
added these word into this
song. Surprisingly, it worked.
Once. It does not work with
the Titanic song. First of all,
there is background music from
the movie played over the ac
tual song, _s Secondly, there is
about one catch phrase in all
of Titanic. Sure, the movie is

beautifully written, but all you
really remember walking out of
the movie is, "If you jump, I
jump." Lastly, I don't think that
"ICEBERG, RIGHT
AHEAD!!" is on the same ro
mantic level as "You complete
me." I don't know. Maybe it's
just me. Maybe "Secret Gar
den" just holds some amount of
sentimental value from those

oh-so-long-ago high school
weekends. Maybe deep down
inside, I am really a Tom Cruise
fan. But as much as I love Ti
tanic and know every word
that Celine sings, I refuse to lis
ten to that poor excuse for a
remix. I just wish that people
(especially music executives
with dollar signs in their eyes)
would just leave a beautifully
orchestrated ballad alone.




A Message from
President Haaland

In recent months, there's
been a great deal of public dis
cussion about ethnicity and
quotas as factors in the college
admission process. Since this is
an ongoing issue—not just at
Gettysburg, but at colleges and
universities across the U.S.—I
want to take this opportunity
to articulate Gettysburg
College's stance on this impor
tant topic.
As a private institu
tion, Gettysburg College is not
bound by federal or state legis
lation regarding admissions or
hiring. Racial quotas have been
illegal since the 1978 Bakke
decision, and Gettysburg Col
lege has never used a quota sys
tem in its admissions decisions.
The College's private
status does-not, however, ex
empt usfrom a moral and ethi
cal obligation to reach out to
people of all racial and ethnic
backgrounds, both when we
recruit students and when we

hire faculty, administrators, and
staff. At Gettysburg College, we
believe that increasing the di
versity of our student body and
our faculty will create a more
vibrant learning community,
one which better reflects the
reality of life in America.
While it would be a
disservice to all involved to
admit any student who was in¬

capable of succeeding at Get
tysburg, we are working very
hard to attract students who
bring something special to our
community. The admissions
process allows for consider
ation of many factors, includ
ing academic performance, spe
cial talents, community service,
past family associations with
the College, and so on.
In short, students who
bring different cultural and eth
nic backgrounds with them to
Gettysburg enhance the expe
rience of everyone here at the
College. We all benefit from
efforts to make Gettysburg a
more diverse community.

I hope you all will join
me in further examination of
this issue throughout the se
mester. In particular, I invite
you all to the February 19
Town Meeting, which will fo
cus on "Diversity Matters."
Mari Matsuda, professor of law
at Georgetown University and
a vocal supporter of diversity
in higher education, will be our
guest speaker. After her brief
talk, Professor Matsuda, Abbey
Rogers, and I will lead a ques
tion-and-answer period. The
Town Meeting begins at 11:30
a.m. and will be held in the
CUB Ballroom. I look forward
to seeing you there.


Conflict and Consensus

Scarred and Battered:

A student's assessment of our liberal arts education

by Henry Fawell
Staff Writer In two and a half years
here at Gettysburg College, 1
have been fortunate to learn
from a number of intelligent,
energetic, and insightful profes
sors who have a firm under
standing of the responsibilities
inherent in their profession. I
am in debt to these men and
women for their inspiring
teaching which has encouraged
me to explore my dearest in
terests and beliefs to the best
of my ability and for the even¬

tual betterment of my future.
And through my coming
years I will be equally affected
by a small group of professors
who, in my view, willfully ig
nored the passions of their stu
dents and chose instead to use
their respective courses as ve
hicles to promote their own
prejudicial political and social
viewpoints. These professors
presented to their students
ideas that undermined the tra
ditional classroom foundations
of respect and consideration
and quickly entered the realms
of hate.

On January 14, the first
day of classes, I attended a
course pertaining to western
. literature, mostly American.
After listening to the first five
minutes of the professor's
opening remarks, I was
tempted to leave the classroom.
But I chose, rather, to jot down
so <me of her remarks, which
centered around the literature
of Western civilization.
As most of you surely
know, this literature genre en
compasses the works of Walt
Whitman, Harriet Beecher
Stowe, William Shakespeare
and a number of other works,
including the King James Bible.
Here is a list of my notes:
1. White male authority
is looking to control and domi
nate. 2. The Western Canon
forces upon us what is right and
good in the minds of white
male authority.
3. The Western Canon
pushes people through the
\!' ' _'
\ ;; j )
j'j
_, .

cracks.
4. Is the Western Canon
even necessary?
5. The fact that William
Shakespeare is known as "the
master" in western civilization
is only because it has been po
liticized and institutionalized
by the white male authority.
6. A quote from the pro
fessor, "History people hate
me, but that just means I'm do
ing my job." (My favorite, be
ing a History major).
What left me even more
bewildered was the absence of
Ernest Hemingway, Flannery
O'Conner and other notable
writers of this genre from the
course syllabus.
I later bumped into a peer
from class who, like me,
dropped it as soon as we were
excused. During our conver
sation, I was struck by his com
ment, "I just wanted to read the
things that move me. She won't
let me do that."

For the first time, I sensed
disappointment in a remark
ably easygoing and optimistic
student who, like me, switched
into the section of another pro
fessor whose methods were not
quite so personal. This incident
indicates a problem, not with
the course, but with a specific
section of it.
This semester is not the
first in which I have experi
enced such an instance. Over a
year ago I took a class pertain
ing to the ancient Greeks and
soon discovered the professor

had a far more narrow agenda
than I had anticipated.
To shorten a painfully
complex discussion we had in
class, I remarked that it was
difficult for a civilization to cre
ate a "just" state, but if each
person relied not on others, but
on themselves it would create
a fairly healthy society. The
professor told me, in the pres
ence of over a dozen of my
peers, that I think like a Nazi
and a slave holder. I sincerely
doubt those of you who know
me would subscribe to this no
tion. It is possible that I did not
present my argument clearly

but, nonetheless, the remark
was a shock, and an embarrass
ment, to an 18 year old who
merely wanted to advance his
fledgling knowledge on classi
cal civilization.
Had I dropped the course
at this time, I would not have
heard the professor later praise
the Greek heroine Medea, for
killing her children so that their
father, her former husband,
could no longer see them. I
also would not have been
handed an essay question pro
posing how the Greek epics
The Iliad and The Odyssey had
been written, not by Homer,
but rather by an anonymous

woman.
If the professors in ques
tion are reading this article,
they may be unable to find the
problem at all, since these are
their comments and I imagine
they would stick to them. But
there is a problem that needs
to be addressed, and, fortu
nately, there is a surprisingly
simple solution.
Department chairs
should, before the beginning of
a semester, be well informed of
what curriculum will he used

in a given section and what that
professors' intentions will be.
If the Chair feels the professor
is straying from the structure
of the course, or if the profes
sor refuses to adhere to the de
scription set forth in the Col
lege Catalogue, than a separate
course should be created under
a different title for those stu
dents still interested. This way,
the three sections of a given
course will present the same
general curriculum, thereby
preventing students from being
mislead in the future.
I find the methods prac
ticed by these professors in
complete contradiction to the
liberal arts education, yet I
must support their natural right
to express their ideas. Further
more, I am not concerned with
restricting a professor from his
or her right to teach, but I am
concerned for our right, as stu

Consider this

Overhearing conversa
tions around campus about the
college we attend, it is hard not
to notice the fact that the com
ments made are overwhelm
ingly negative.
Students complain about
everything from tuition and
Gordon Haaland to the food at
Servo. What this college lacks is
school spirit.
Many of us went to high
schools that were overflowing
with school spirit. We got ex
cited about homecoming and
playing our big rivals. We at
tended pep rallies and painted
our faces.
Naturally, there are ex
ceptions to this rule. But there
is nobody out there that does
not know what school spirit is.
Attendance of events on
this campus is pathetic. The
football stadium is practically
empty in the fall, and though
many of our sports teams do
exceedingly well, there is rarely
anybody there to cheer them
on. Sports events are not the
only ones that are neglected.
Theater productions, recitals,
and Common Hours, to name
a few, are incredibly under at
tended.
We attend an outstanding
school. It is not perfect; but
what school is? The problems
that many students find with
Gettysburg would be found at

any similar school. And we too
often forget how lucky we are
to even be attending such an
institution of higher learning.
Maybe nobody notices
those signs that proclaim that
our dining services are among
the best of the nation. Maybe
people spend too much of their
time drunk to notice all the op
portunities available to us.
People complain that
there is nothing to do on this
campus. Check out "This Week
at Gettysburg." The calendar
is full of lectures, social events,
and functions happening
around campus. If a person did
not have to worry about classes
and homework, he or she could
spend all week running from
place to place.
Homecoming weekend
here is geared completely to
wards alumni. Students should
be out at the football game,
rooting on our team and inter
acting with the people that
made Gettysburg what it is.
We should support our
teams, our friends, our peers.
Those people on stage, on the
fields, on the courts are the
same people who we go to
classes with. If you were per
forming, wouldn't you want
someone there to appreciate
you? Gettysburg College is not
perfect, but it is a good place.
We should take the time we're
here to appreciate it.

— Conflict and Consensus—
From the Donkey's Mouth

Clinton will come through this

by Matt Brown
Political Columnist
I don't know about the
rest of you, but I am certainly
starting to get sick of all the at
tention that is being paid to the
stories of Monica Lewinsky.
You would think that with a
crisis in the Middle East brew
ing, that the media would pay
a considerable bit more atten
tion to that situation than to all
the rumors being spread about
our nation's president and
some mixed up girl who we are
starting to learn a lot about.
I wonder if Republicans
would still cry that the media
is liberal after all that has been

said about the president. I can
see our friends on the fringe of
right wing politics foaming at
the mouth, hoping that these
allegations of an affair and sub
orning perjury bring down the
president. The opponents of
the president think they can
dupe the American people into
looking at these allegations
more critically then the
president's many successes.
But that is not going to happen.
The American people are
upset that some of the allega
tions could be true, but they
also see how well our country
is doing. The American people
realize that this is not the first

time that a president has been
accused of or actually had an
affair. In fact, our nation's first
president, the great George
Washington, whom we remem
ber fondly this month, has been
accused of having an affair.
Throughout history, our
president's have had or have
rumored to have had affairs,
Franklin Roosevelt,
Eisenhower, Kennedy, LBJ,
Bush all fall into this category.
I know we all like to think that
our president's are perfect
models in every way, but they
are flawed just like us. Despite
these rumors however, our na
tion has continued to have
strong leaders. Bill Clinton is
one such strong leader, the
American people overwhelm¬

ingly approve of the way that
President Bill Clinton is doing
his job. We have the lowest
unemployment rate in 24 years.
America is experiencing the
highest level of home owner
ship ever. Crime rates are fall
ing. Incomes are rising.
America's commitment to im
proving education is growing.
Thanks to President Clinton,
we finally have'a balanced bud
get. No matter what the right
says about his morals, that can
not take away his successes. In
fact after all he's done, I won
der what kind of buildings they
will be naming after him when
his 87th birthday comes
around.
We just have to accept
that we do not yet know what
has happened between the
president and Monica

Lewinsky. It is quite premature
to make blanket attacks against
the president. The fact is that
every time this pawn of the
right, Ken Starr, has tried to get
the president on something he
has failed. I think it only right
and proper that the Justice
Department to begin to inves
tigate this man. So many things
have leaked out of his office,
he has spent so much of
America's tax dollars and all he
has to show for it is the con
victions of a small number of
Clinton associates. I think we
should question if this lawyer

is not out for justice, but ven
geance against the president.
We need to know if Ken Starr
is wasting our money. After all,
we are looking to cut govern
ment spending and I think it
would be better to cut the
spending of a fruitless crusade
then any other worthwhile pro
gram. Who knows how much
more could have been done
with the money that Ken Starr
has wasted on chasing after the
president. Regardless of what
I think, it is high time to see
whether or not Ken Starr is car
rying out his investigation in a
judicious way.
Who is this Monica
Lewinsky anyway? As the story

unfolds we see that she was
surrounded by a sketchy
crowd. Linda Tripp_, the friend
that records her conversations,
a woman bent on bringing
down President Clinton, writ
ing a book to make profit from
her supposed knowledge.
Tripp's publisher, a woman
who believes she will person
ally will be a hero for bringing
down the president. Lewinsky,
herself, has been involved in
numerous affairs. Lewinsky
was supposedly obsessed with

the president. The facts point
to a record of lying and ques
tionable behavior on the part
of Miss Monica Lewinsky. Can
we trust these women?
I am afraid that we may
never know or may never truly
be able to believe what has hap
pened. So many people have
blackened President Clinton's
good name that we may not be
able to sort out the truth of
what happened for quite some
time. It might be pertinent to
remember that the central fig¬

ure of right wing ideology,
Ronald Reagan whom Repub
licans are so eager to name
things after, faced a crisis in his
presidency with the Iran-Con
tra scandal. 'Like Reagan, I be
lieve that President Clinton will
weather the storm (and who
knows perhaps one day there
will be a nonsense rush to name
things after him too). Not only
will Clinton weather the storm,
but I believe he will successfully
continue to tackle the chal
lenges facing America.



Missing morals

by Cammie Grant
Political Columnist

been placed on Colorado Re
publicans by Colorado Demo
crats. All accusations have been
denied by the Republican Party
Why do the Democrats point
their finger to the Republican
Party when private, potentially
harmful information is un
earthed?
Not only in Clinton's al
leged affair, but now the Re
publicans are to blame for
Romer's relationship. It is time
for the Democratic Party to pay
the price, which may be their
reputation, and admit their
wrong doings.

Chairman of the Demo
cratic National Committee and
Colorado Governor, Roy
Romer admitted last week to a
16 year relationship with B.J.
Thornberry. Thornberry
worked on many of Romer's
Colorado gubernatorial cam
paigns and was his assistant at
the Democratic National Com
mittee in Washington D.C.
Governor Romer has been ac
cused of having an affair with
Thornberry for many years and
has repeatedly denied it.
Insight Magazine re¬

leased a cover story early
Thursday morning on the
Internet summarizing the de
tails of Romer's relationship
with Thornberry. The maga
zine stated, "Insight has ob
tained confidential records-in
cluding photographs and video
tapes-purportedly showing that
Romer may have had more
than a platonic relationship." A
Denver private investigator was
hired to track Romer in 1995
and uncover details about his
private life, according to In
sight Magazine. Blame has

Governor Romer told the
Denver Post, "We worked this
out among ourselves. We knew
it would not fit the public per
ception." Roy, of course it does
not fit the public perception;
screwing around on your wife
with another woman is not
morally correct and the public
should shun Roy Romer. When
asked about his denials con
cerning his relationship with
Thronberry he said, "I was
carefully answering about hav
ing a sexual affair. I am not a
very sexual person." Romer's
wife, Bea prepared a public
statement, "B.J. Thornberry is

a close friend of Roy's. He has
been open with me and shared
the facts about the relationship
with me from the beginning. It
has not affected our marriage
or our family. I ask people to
respect our private lives." Mrs.
Romer's statement is tasteful
and brief. She, ' however, will
not openly admit the pain her
husband's relationship has
caused. Even if Governor
Romer is not sleeping with
Thornberry, having an extra
marital relationship is unac
ceptable.
What I find most disturb
ing is the fact the Colorado
Governor and Democratic Na
tional Committee Chairman
has lied repeatedly when ac
cused of a relationship with
Thornberry. How can the
people of Colorado and mem
bers of the Democratic Na
tional Committee trust this
man, not only with the future
of Colorado but, the future of
the Democratic Party?

Maybe extramarital af
fairs are a way of life for high
ranking Democrats. My advice
to Bill and Roy, get some mor
als and values, if not for your
selves, but for the individuals
for whom you are representing.

The Pachyderm's Pulpit

Senate works and works

Battered

by John Dunlap
Political Columnist
Within the next month
another session of Gettysburg
College's Student Senate will
come to an end, as new elec
tions are held. Having served
on Senate since the beginning
of my freshman year I have
come to the conclusion that
Senate can and most of the time
does work. This year has been
a good year for Student Senate.
Under the leadership of Senate
President Abby Rogers and Vice
President Val Katzmar, the Sen¬

ate has moved at more swift
and decisive pace in enacting
change and getting things done.
Today Senate, is at the fore
front of pushing for so
cial change on _^^^^m

ing to _^^^^_L _^^^H
brine _^^^^^_A_^^^^H

pus.

t h e _^^^_M
a d - _^^^H
minis
t r a -
tion has an important an
nouncement to make or policy
to implement they often come
before Student Senate. Take
for instance, President Gordon
Haaland's announcement just a
few weeks ago that the student
body will have fifty thousand
dollars to spend on all-campus
social events. It was Senate that
started the campus discussion
on the new sexual consent
policy. Dean Julie Ramsey
came to Student Senate to first
discuss the changes.
As a member of Senate
representing the Class of 2000,

I feel as if I have an obligation
to represent the opinion of my
entire class, as well as the Col
lege as a whole. Student Sen
ate is the vehicle for communi
cation between the administra
tion, the faculty, and between
each class as well. The money
we appropriate in Senate is
your money, the money you
pay to go to Gettysburg Col
lege. This is why I was proud
when, after a great debate, Sen
ate decided to fully fund the
Civil War Club. This is Get
tysburg after all, the site of the
greatest battle of the Civil
War.

Senate
this year has
had

_^^^^^^_H many
interest
ing de
bates and
discussions on some of the
prominent issues facing our
campus and how we spend the
money we are given.
There is nothing wrong
with debate; we are a legisla
tive body and as representatives
of the entire campus's views
than debate is only inevitable.
Discussion and debate in Sen
ate is not limited to Senators
and club representatives, but is
open to everyone. More of the
campus should get involved
and come to Senate. This is our
College, and if we feel it is

moving in the wrong direction,
or are dissatisfied with a cer
tain policy than Senate is where
our grievance can be heard.
Change can occur, and I
have seen it. Last year, because
I felt that Senate was at times
overly long and very drawn
out, I along with my colleague
Ted Hartman drafted a contract
with Gettysburg. Its purpose
was to reform the Senate pro
cess. Working with all of Sen
ate and Senate's Executive
Board it was com
posed.

W Wnn
I felt
that
members

^^^^^^ of the stu
^^^_r dent body were
wronged by the
denial of tenure of
Dr. Edward DeClair
of the Political Science
Department, I took my
concern to Student Senate.
What I found out was that I
was not alone, as students in
and outside of the Political Sci
ence Department rallied to Dr.
DeClair's side. While the ad
ministration failed to reverse
their decision concerning Dr.
DeClair we were able to see
how the tenure process worked
and hopefully, we the student
body will get to play a larger
role in the future, when it
comes to deciding who will be
teaching us.

Senate has had a lot of
success. Before I arrived on
campus it was Senate that was
able to keep _iVlusselman Li
brary open 24 hours a day. It
is Senate that funds the
College's clubs and organiza
tions. Much more is left to be
done. Before Senate moves
forward more internal changes
are necessary.

The Residence Hall Sena
tors idea should be done away
with. Today the Vice President
of each hall gets to serve on
Senate. Many times people
elected from these dorms do
not know that they have to go
to Senate and in some dorms
people switch around who will
represent them at Senate. Vice
Presidents of dorms should
have the same position as club
representatives. Currently, it
does not seem that they feel
fully part of Senate and in their
place the number of Senators
per class should be increased to
at least seven, perhaps even
eight. Beyond the change
within Senate itself, the social
life of the campus is dramati¬

cally changing. With B.Y.O.B
and the weakening of Greek
organizations on campus as a
social outlet for students, more
must be done to make Gettys
burg an enjoyable place to live
and work. This is an issue that
Senate and the Student Activi
ties Council are currently
working on. The fifty-thou
sand dollars that has been ap
propriated for social programs
is a good idea. As chairman of
the sub-committee on how the
money shall be spent, Val
Katzmar explained last week at
Senate, this is only to hold us
over. We need a long-term fix
to aid the social environment
of this College and- the next
Senate will be crucial in decid
ing what that fix will be.

Senate should be doing
more to help strengthen the
Greek organizations on cam
pus. Gettysburg College owes
fraternities and sororities a lot.
For years they were the social
outlets for the student body
and now with new rules and
regulations, their roles are
changing. They need help in
making that change. First of
all, we all need to chip in and
help Alpha XI Delta; if its
chapter were to come to an end
that would be a real tragedy.
Lastly, the Senate's new
leadership and members should

remember that while we must
work with administration to
enact change, it's also our re
sponsibility to stand up to the
administration when we think
they are wrong. We can never
forget that this is our campus
and for at least four years of
our life this is home, and we
have responsibility to make it
better.

- continued from page 11-

dents, to study the concepts
that motivate us to open our
minds to education.
Beyond all the social
events and activities that reso
nate through our campus, each
student, at least once, takes a
course not as a requirement,
but because it speaks to the
principles that govern him or
her as an individual. We should
be deeply concerned for the
safety of these issues, which
spark each one of us, though
we may not admit it, to con
tinue reading a book beyond its'
given assignment. If these pre
cious ideas are twisted and dis
torted by even a few willing
professors, then the founda
tions of a liberal arts education
will inevitability crumble with
them.

There is simply no room
on this campus for prejudice
against a culture, gender or
race, nor should statements ba
ed on strident ideologies or po
itics be tolerated by anyone.
Instead, students and profes
sors alike should work to em
brace the virtues of fairness and
impartiality, while living up to
both professional and moral
standards. When we accom
plish this, our classrooms will
flourish with a fundamental
basis of respect for all the cul
tures and ideas that humanity,
in it's great complexity, has to
offer us.

Bullets take title, then fall
hard to Hopkins

It's that time of year

By Pete Huminski
Staff reporter Last weekend was an
other successful weekend for
the Lady Bullets basketball
team. On Friday night, Get
tysburg defeated Wesley Col
lege to advance to the cham
pionship game of the Gettys
burg Invitational.
In the championship
game the Lady Bullets faced
NAIA Georgian Court. Get
tysburg got out of the gate
quickly outsconng the Lions
12-0 in the first 4:01 of the
ball game. The Lions were
unable to overcome this fast
start as the Bullets held off
several Georgian Court runs
to win 71-60.

Tournament MVPs Jen
Dravis and Jamie Dawson got
the Bullets off to a quick start
scoring six points each dur
ing the opening run. Geor

Wrestlers gear up
From the Gettysburg College
Press release
Gettysburg College's
Jake Dell will attempt to win
his weight class for the fourth
year in a row when the Cen
tennial Conference conducts
its fifth annual wrestling
championship Saturday, Feb
ruary 14, at Lamb-Miller
Field House on the campus of
Swarthmore College.
If successful, Dell will
become only the second wres
tler in conference history to
win four titles. He was the
champion at 158 pounds and

any closer than six points during
the first half and trailed at half
time, 32-22.
The Lions rallied behind
back-to-back 3-pointers by
Christine Curtin to cut the Bul
lets lead to 50-45 with seven
minutes to go in the game. The
Lady Bullets responded with a
fierce 12-2 run that put the game
away. Dravis finished the game
with 23 points, while Dawson
added 10 points and nine re
bounds to earn a spot on the all
tournament team. Steph Dravis
and Lauren Frankford chipped in
with 11 and nine points, respec
tively. The Lady Bullets (15-5, 8
3 in Centennial Conference)
were not quite as fortunate on
Tuesday night, as they were over
the weekend. Gettysburg trav
eled to Centennial Conference
leading Johns Hopkins Tuesday
and were handed a 71-49 loss.

for post-season
was voted the conference's most
outstanding wrestler as a fresh
man in 1994 before moving up
a weight class and earning back
to-back titles at 167 the past two
years. Dell, who has lost only
once in 31 matches this season
and was 6-0 in conference dual
meets, enters the conference
tournament as the top-ranked
Division III wrestler in the na
tion at 167 pounds.
The tournament will also
decide the team championship;
Gettysburg has never finished
higher than second or lower than
third. Ursinus is the two-time

defending champion, with the
Bullets winding up third behind
Ursinus and Western Maryland
a year ago.
Dell is not the only
former champion who will be
competing for Gettysburg on
Saturday. Senior Chris Clifford
won the 158-pound weight
class in 1996 as a sophomore.
He brings a 20-11 record to the

tournament in his bid to unseat
the defending 158-pound
champion, Donny Asper of
Ursinus.
Other Gettysburg wres
tlers who could be seeded first
or second in their weight class,
along with their overall and
conference dual records: senior
Jamie Binnall, 13-14, 5-1, at
118 pounds; junior Marty

Scarpato, 21-9, 5-0, at 126
pounds; senior Brad
McCutcheon, 9-8, 0-0, or
sophomore Andrew Buck, 10
8, 4-2, at 142 pounds; sopho
more Chris Beck, 12-15, 3-2,
at 150 pounds; senior James
Lobsenz, 16-14, 4-2, at 177
pounds; and freshman Brad
Baker, 10-7, 3-1, at 190
pounds.

The win for the Blue Jays
clinched a spot in the confer
ence playoffs for Johns
Hopkins, but the Lady Bullets
will have to win their remain
ing three conference games to
secure a spot in the playoffs.
Jen Dravis was the only
Lady Bullet in double figures
with 13 points. Courtney
Marotta added eight points,
while Steph Dravis scored

Bullets burn Red Devils in OT

Thanks to an 18-8 run in the extra session the Bullets knock off Dickinson

By Paul Redfern
Staff Writer The Gettysburg Bullets
Basketball team capped off the
week with an outstanding per
formance at Dickinson on Sat
urday night. After loosing a
vital game to F&M on Wednes
day at home, the Bullets trav
was
proved to be a do or die match
up. The Bullets entered the
game tied with Dickinson with
a 4-4 conference record. The
Bullets had defeated the Red
Devils earlier in the season 74
72 in a game that saw the
begining of a real hot streak for
the Bullets. They hoped the
same would happen on Satur
day night.

With sophomore ball
handler Ryan Napp on the
bench with a shoulder injury
and not available for the game,
the Bullets were short on guards

with varsity game experience.
When junior Jon Bowman
went down with an ankle in
jury with 13 minutes left in the

third period,
Coach Petrie
had to test the
depth of his
bench.
To fill
's
he used a com
bination of se
nior Co-Captian
John Bauersfeld
and first year
Carter Mecham.
Mecham had
been brought up
from the J.V.
team to backup
Bowman, and
both he and
Buaersfeld shined

when they got their chances.
Bauersfeld hit two three
pointers to spark the offensive
attack while Mecham played

the point of a solid zone de

and defensive plays from se

Hammer Throw, and 35-lb.
Weight Mitko Koburov (also
known as Kube) is just one of
the many hard working athletes
that participates in indoor
track. "Kube" is an integral
part of the throwing squad as
well as the main entertainment
for the entire team.
Although Kube is not set
ting school records like team
mate Nate Grim, his absence
would surely be noticed. Kube
provides much needed points
for the total which helps Get
tysburg come out on top. He
says that the athletes, "use this
as an opportunity to prepare
for the spring track season."
And he is no exception.
He donates two hours a day

two hours of hard work in the

The winter track season has ended, but that doesn't mean Beth Castagno is not gearing up
for spring.

Emily Brown is another
key component of the team.
She is a two-sport athlete that
sprints for the team. Her hard
work and dedication is sought
after by many members of the
team. Last year as a freshman,
Emily broke the school record
in the 400 meter hurdles. She
was also on the school record
breaking 4x100 meter relay
team. Brown was also on the

Lady Bullets soccer team which
went to the NCAA playoffs this
past fall.
Indoor Track allows an
extra two months for them to
perfect their technique and
work on their times for the
spring season. The atmosphere
is laid back and allows the ath
letes to have fun and enjoy each
other's company while work
ing hard to make themselves
better. The throwing team, in

particular is a close-knit group
that lifts, practices, and goes
out together.
The team, coached by
Robert Condon and John
Schmid, practices everyday
and participates in meets on
the weekends.
Although the indoor
track team does not have any
home meets, Kube, Emily and
the gang are eagerly awaiting
for the spring season and some
fan support.

throw of 116_'11". In addition,
she broke Gettysburg's shot put
record whenshe was the event's
runner-up at Centennial's with
a distance of 3 8'2".
Both Coach Condon and
Coach Schmid are very opti
mistic about Cathy's possibili
ties at the upcoming indoor and
outdoor championships and for
the future. With Cathy's im
mense talent both coaches be
lieve she is a national-caliber
athlete. She even has an out
side chance at qualifying for the
National Championships in the
shot put this spring. Coach
Schmid_'s most immediate goal
for Spangler is to break the 40

- continued from page 23 -
foot barrier in the shot put.
"Cathy is a very talented, hard
working and coachable ath
lete," explained Schmid. "She's
learned a lot and she is still
learning."
Spangler has enormous
potential for even greater suc
cesses over the next few years.
For Cathy the most important
thing about track is that it is her
own "thing." "Everyone needs
to have one thing that is their
own thing," Spangler notes.
"You are missing out if you
don't have your one main
thing." For both Cathy Spangler
and Nathan Grim throwing is
their "one main thing." They
have consistently worked hard
to achieve their throwing goals
and it has paid off.

As Nathan comes to the
end of his collegiate career, he
strives to attain, for the last
possible time, his goals. He
pushes on towards the Na
tional championship and a
possible Ail-American status
with all the strength and de
termination he possesses.
Cathy, on the other hand, has
two and half years ahead of her
and a lot of room to live up to
her potential.
No matter what goals
they each have set and what
goals they attain, the most im
portant thing for both Grim
and Spangler is that they leave
Gettysburg with fond memo
ries of all they have achieved
and the friends they have
made.

Nathan Grim is the savvy veteran who has taken home numerous titles. Cathy Spangler is the
youngster looking to dominate the Centennial Conference for years to come.

By Chesha Miller
Player Profiler
Gettysburg College is
lucky to have two of the Cen
tennial Conference's most tal
ented throwers in their midst
senior Nathan Grim and
sophomore Cathy Spangler.
Ironically, both track and field
athletes are relatively hew to
their successes.
Nathan Grim began his
athletic career playing soccer
when he was 8 years old.
Throughout high school he
continued to play soccer and
began playing basketball as
well. In order to keep in shape
for soccer and basketball,
Nathan _decided to join the
track team in the spring. He
threw the javelin and the shot
put and also ran the quarter
mile.

A true athlete at heart _.
Grim knew his athletic career
would have to continue after
higljschool. Following a failed
attempt to join the soccer team
his first year, Nathan spoke
with his Wellness instructor and
track and field throws coach,
John Schmid. Coach Schmid
encouraged Nathan, who is
fondly known as Nate, to speak
with head coach Bob Condon
and to join the track team.
Nathan laughs, "I went to see
Coach Condon and he sent me
right to the weight room." The
265 pound Grim weighed only
200 pounds at the time, cer
tainly not enough to be a com
petitive thrower.
"I was a scrub as a fresh¬

man and was always getting
kicked around by everyone in
the conference," said Grim.
That soon changed. Grim is
very well versed in his throws.
Indoors he throws the shot put
and 35 lb. weight, outdoors, in
addition to the shot put, Grim
throws the discus and the ham
mer. "I really enjoy the synergy
between all the events and the
technique work in each helps
me in the other," commented
Grim. Nathan won his first col
legiate medal as a sophomore
during the indoor season, plac-

ing third in the shot put at the
Centennial Conference Cham
pionships. He repeated his
third place finish in the out
door season and then again in
the indoor season of his junior
year. Last spring Nathan broke
the Centennial Conference
record in both the shot put and
the discus. In addition he was
the Centennial Conference
Champion of both events.
Nathan also holds both
Gettysburg's indoor and out
door records in the shot put

as well as the hammer record.
A few weekends ago
Nathan qualified provisionally
for the National Champion
ships in the shot put with a
throw of 50' 2". This past
weekend he improved his
throw to 52'1", practically guar
anteeing him a spot at Nation
als- he is presently seeded fifth.
Nathan and his coaches are
hoping he will defend his Con
ference title and qualify for
Nationals in the spring as well.
According to Coach
Schmid, Nathan has great tech
nique. "Nate is a technician,"

photo by Emily _Glatfeller
said Schmid,,"He is practically
the assistant throws coach and
he has madehimself into every
thing he is today." In high
school Nathan struggled with
the shot put and didn't even
enjoy doing it, but since com
ing to college it has become a
huge focus in his life. "I've
learned if you do something
you truly enjoy and are able to
devote yourself to it willingly,
you will be rewarded," ex
plained Nathan, "In high school
I did stuff for my coaches, in

college, I did it for myself- be
cause I love it."
Nathan has had many
good people to push him to
where he is today. His parents,
Bruce and Kathleen, have been
excellent role models and have
constantly given Nathan en
couragement. When he was
growing up, Nathan's father
was very involved in his athlet
ics as a coach of his soccer
team. But more importantly to
Grim, his father has always
been a friend to him. Grim
greatly admires his mother,
who just recently went back to

school for her bachelors and
masters degrees. At Gettys
burg, Nathan is supported by
his fellow throwers who are his
best friends. He commented,
"I'm out there every day hav
ing a great time with my best
friends and no matter how bad
a mood I am in when I get to
practice, I always leave smil
ing." Cathy Spangler is another
thrower who is always smiling.
Like Nathan she has had won
derful people ' supporting her
along the way. Her mom,
Patricia, is a very special per
son who is very loving and sup
portive of both Cathy and her
brother. Talking about her
mother, Cathy commented,
"When you grow up with some
one like that, you know you'll
be okay."

The sophomore thrower
began her track and field career
as a junior in high school. "One
-

of the track coaches asked me
if I'd ever thrown before. I
hadn't, but I'd always wanted
to do something," Cathy ex
plained, "I tried it and I liked
it." Not only did Cathy like it,
but she was good at throwing
too. Cathy, who competes in
the shot put, 20 pound weight,
hammer and discus, is most
taken with the discus. "I love
throwing the discus because I
feel so graceful when I throw
it," she explained. "[The dis
cus] just flies and it makes me
feel good."
In high school, she held
the shot put relay record which
was over 110 feet. Since com
ing to Gettysburg, Cathy has
continued in her successes and
grown through them. In the
indoor season of her first year,
Spangler broke the school
record in the 20 pound weight
throw with a distance of 33'4"
Last spring Spangler won the

Rush brings
changes to

Hail to the chief

sororities

Eighty-eight women go through formal rush

Anthony DeFail of Alpha Chi Rho celebrates his
victory as Mr. Fraternity last Friday.

by Laura Root
Staff Reporter
The Greek System at
Gettysburg College has been un
dergoing a period of change. Dur
ing this year's Formal Rush, all of
the sororities witnessed some new

occurances.
Eighty-eight women went
through Formal Rush this year. All
88 were accepted as pledges to the
four sororities participating in
Rush. (Alpha Xi Delta followed a
different strategy to attract mem
bers this year.) This number was
considerably lower than in previ
ous years, especially considering
the large size of the First Year class.
According to Meaghan
Halpin, the vice president of this
year's rush, this has not occurred
at Gettysburg College in recent
times. Halpin gives credit for this
victory to the Rho Chis, or Rush
Counselors, who encouraged the
women not to "suicide" a sorority
by having a certain sorority be their
only choice. Most women had a
few first choices.

The 88 pledges were distrib
uted fairly evenly between the four
sororities. Alpha Delta Pi has 19
pledges, Chi Omega has 20, Delta
Gamma has 22, and Gamma Phi
Beta has 23.
The withdrawl of Alpha Xi
Delta from Formal Rush had an
effect the amount of women that
each sorority could accept.

Happy 21st Birthday Mark Astrom

Alpha Xi Delta has presently
accepted five new members with
theur new rush policy.
On the last day of Rush, there
is a certain number of members that
each sorority is allowed to take in,
called quota.
Quota is the number of Final
Rushees divided by the number of
sororities. Dividing the number by
four instead of five increased the
number of pledges in each sorority.
This year, the quota was 23
women per each of the four sorori
ties involved in formal rush. Last
year, the quota was larger. A 24
woman quota was given to five so
rorities.
Neither Halpin nor Pan-Hel
President Rebecca O'Connell has an
explanation for the drop in the
number of rushees.
This year was also the first in
history that no Rush Violations were
recorded.

A Rush Violation involves
breaking the Code of Silence be
tween sorority members and rush
ees imposed during the weeks of
Formal Rush. A violator is usually
expelled from Rush.
"I'm especially happy with
this new development," says Claire
Christman, president of Chi Omega.
For the most part, Formal
Rush has pleased everyone. Both
Halpin and O'Connell are excited
about the changes that occurred this
year. "Overall, it went really well,"
sums up O'Connell.

Gettysburg College on Channel Five

by Kabir Kumai
Staff Reporter The Gettysburg College
_Television Station (GCTV)
broadcasted for the first time
in many years, this Saturday,
Valentine's Day from 7 to 9 pm
on Channel Five.
The broadcast included a
basketball game between Johns
Hopkins and Gettysburg Col
lege, Video Valentines, and a
short film by a first year stu
dent titled "297."
"1 would like to have
more student films," said Matt
Bange, Station Director. "I
would like students to get cre
ative," Bange has been

invovled from the start with the
revival of the television station
since the birth of the idea last
October.
"There were revival com
mittee meetings most of last
semester," he said. "We wanted
to organize it in a way we
thought it would make it," he
added.
"We had all the equip
ment we needed to start up,"
said Mike Wooden, Student
Advisor to the station. Wooden
was involved in an earlier at
tempt to revive the station
which failed. "It failed then
because it did not have enough
backing," he said.
" We have a number of

people dedicated to the sta
tion," said Wooden "But we
need to get people involved -
not just the people in the sta
tion." The Station members had
been collecting Video Valen
tines in the main lobby of the
College Union Building last
week. "We didn't get as many
valentines," said Wooden.
"They were under six min
utes," said Bange.
The Station decided to go
ahead with the broadcast on
Valentine's Day. Due to the
lack of programming material
the same program has been
scheduled to be shown from 7
p.m. to 9 p.m. this week.
"It had to have a start,"
said Wooden. "Now that we
are on the air it will attract
more people," said Bange.

The time slot of 7 to 9 pm
coincides with television pro
grams on popular stations. "We
are right now competing with
primetime TV - that is a given,"
said Bange.
Bange hopes that the
channel and station will be no
ticed if viewed more often. "I
think it will take a while," he
added.

Zalewski runs for Senate President

Treasurer feels "very qualified" for position

by Ann Marie Bieli
Staff Reporter Sara Zalewski is a junior
at Gettysburg College and is
double majoring in philosophy
and political science. She is the
treasurer of Student Senate this
year, and is currently running
for the position of president for
next year. Sara believes that
her many activities, her well
roundedness, and her experi
ence in Student Senate over the
last three years make her the
best candidate for the job.
Zalewski has been ex
tremely involved during her
four years here at Gettysburg
College. She has been the
president of the Class of 1999
for the last three years. She
stated, "We have a really suc
cessful, great class govern-

She has been a member of
Gender Benders for two years,
an appointed member of the
student conduct review board
for two years, and a tour guide
for three years.
Zalewski has been also
been indirectly involved with
Gettysburg Students Against
Racism (GSAR). Sara has sat
in on the Commission for
Women, worked in the politi
cal science department, is a
member of the women's rugby
team and is currently the sec
retary of the newly established
pre law society.
Zalewski believes the nu¬

merous activities she has beer
involved with have made her i
very well rounded person anc
have enabled her to make some
important contacts. Most im
portant to this election how
ever, are the positions she has
held in Student Senate and as
an important member of sen
ate committees.
Zalewski has sat in on
many executive senate meet
ings. Sara believes this is per
haps the number one reason
she is more qualified for the
position of president of student
senate than her opponents,
John Dunlap and Earl Redding.
Zalewski stated, "the
other candidates have never sat
in on executive meetings, they
don't know how to run the
meetings or execute the rules,
things which are necessary
when being president."

Zalewski has many con
cerns and goals for the upcom
ing year and Student Senate,
She wants to create initiatives
for campus traditions, old and
new. She also wants to concen
trate on Gettysburg's school
spirit. She stated that she feels
the campus community is be
ginning to lose its school spirit.
She also stated that she plans
to strengthen the ties between
faculty, students, and adminis
tration. Another important
goal for Zalewski is to bring the
Gettysburg campus closer to
the Gettysburg community.
Creating new goals for

senate is not Zalewski's only
objective, she is also con
cerned with continuing and
improving upon current ac
complishments of student sen
ate. She hopes to continue to
worktowards adequate repre
sentation of the student body
in student senate. She also
want to continue the social
programming and the answer
ing and confronting of stu
dents' concerns and issues.
She stated, " I feel very
qualified for the position of
president of Student Senate. I
have always had the best in
tentions to improve campus
and continue the positive
things." .

In the beginning of the
current semester, Zalewski
dropped many of her activi
ties to ensure she could take a
full responsibility if elected
president of Student Senate.
Sara is now solely involved in
Student Senate and class gov
ernment.
Zalewski reiterated sev
eral times that she is not run
ning for this position as a "re
sume builder." She said, "I
have a genuine concern for the
student body and I am not do
ing it just for the name."
Student senate elections
will be held February 23, 24,
and 25 in the College Union
Building.

Liberating our bodies

by Cara Masucci
Staff Reporter The message is inescap
able: the thinner you are, the
better. The constant bombard
ment with magazine and tele
vision commercials trying to
sell weight loss products has led
many Americans to hold up an
ideal that has never really ex
isted. This in turn leads many
to eating disorders in attempt
to capture what is in vogue. A
great number of people realize
this, but really do not do any
thing about it. In a campus
wide effort to increase aware
ness and further movement to
expel eating disorders from the
Gettysburg College campus,
next week has been deemed
Eating Disorder Awareness
Week.

There are three main
types of eating disorders: an
orexia nervosa, bulimia
nervosa, and compulsive over
eating.
The first, anorexia
nervosa, is a disorder where a
person eats too little in order
to stay thin. This often leads
to the point of emaciation.
Many people suffering from
the disorder have an intense
fear of gaining weight and eat
ing foods with any fat. The
disorder can also lead to over
exercise in order to shed
pounds. Many times those
with the disorder still see them
selves as overweight, even
though everyone else around
them could be telling them they
are too thin.

Unfortunately, being too
thin is not the only problem
anorexics face. Many times de
hydration and kidney problems
can occur. Hair and nail loss
can take place, as well as severe
cardiac problems. Other
symptoms associated with the
disorder are dry skin, insomnia,
stress fractures, constipation,
and, in women, amenorrhea
(loss of menstruation). It is es
timated that between five and
eighteen percent of those suf
fering from anorexia will die.

Bulimia nervosa sufferers
are characterized by severe
binging and purging in order
to keep weight off. Purging
may come by way of vomiting
or through the use of laxatives.
Use of diuretics and excessive
exercise may also be employed.
The behavior may be done
sporadically over the course of
a month or many times a day.
Bulimics often times have pe
t ir" _^j——mmimxm _.g._Mifl_^iB'' *-

riods of rapid weight loss and
gain. Like anorexia, there are
many medical problems asso
ciated with bulimia nervosa.
Digestive disorders, constipa
tion, severe dental problems
and loss of teeth, skin rashes,
hair loss, amenorrhea, and os
teoporosis may occur. Vomit
ing can cause bleeding of the
esophagus, seizures, and severe
cardiac problems as well. In
many cases, bulimia can also
cause death.
The third disorder, com
pulsive overeating, is some
times pushed into the shadow
of the other two disorders.
Compulsive overeaters go on
periods of binging and may
become obese.
People suffering from

this disorder oftentimes suffer
from shortness of breath, high
blood pressure, and joint prob
lems. The problem can become
life threatening in that it can
cause heart disease, heart at
tacks, diabetes, and contribute
to certain forms of cancer.
With all the ill effects of
eating disorders, it becomes
very confusing why many,
sometimes as much as one-fifth

of the population turns to these
options. Eating disorders do
not exclude males, but the ma
jority with the disorders are fe
male. In fact, the victims do not
include only ordinary women.
Famous figures such as Karen
Carpenter (who died from the
medical complications of an
eating disorder) and the late
Princess Diana was suffering
from eating disorders. It is a
problem that affects everyone.
No one is immune.
There are many cultural
and psychological factors that
play a role in causing the disor
der. First, it is no secret that
American culture encourages
people to base self-worth and
esteem on body weight. Ac
cording to Frances Parker of the
counseling center, the fashion

industry is playing a large part
in the problem. The women
in magazines are taped up and
electronically distorted, so
when one is trying to measure
up to that idea!, they are not
able to. The models themselves
are not even able to. For most
women, the genetic makeup is
such that the boylike figure
deemed attractive is not acces
sible.

Parker is quick to point
out, though, that it is beautiful
to have that body type in the
same way it should be seen as
beautiful to have a whole
myriad of body types. Parker
states, "All of us have to be ac
cepting of diversity in every
way. People cannot be the same
size in the same way they can
not be the same race or reli
gion." The purpose of next
week is to further the accep
tance of diversity in body types.
Debbie Fielder, Chair of the
President's Commission on
Women: Eating Disorder Task
Force, states that the group
wants to go beyond awareness
and develop serious and coor
dinated efforts on the campus
to expel the problem. Part of

the focus of next week's events,
according to Fielder, will be to
make known to all students at
Gettysburg what services are
available to them if they or
someone they know has an eat
ing disorder. Support at the
college includes individual
therapy, nutrition consultation,
medical testing to check for ill
effects of the disorders, and
numerous other services and
referrals. Fielder also said there
will be a nutritionist coming to
speak to the College next week
to demonstrate "what is normal
and what is a disorder." Fielder
agrees with Parker in some of
the causes for the disorders.
"The body myths are learned
and culturally situated," she
stated.

Both women are quick to
point out, though, that al
though society can be viewed
as having the most profound
affect on the presence of eat
ing disorders, it is not a cut and
dry problem. An eating disor
der can sometimes stem out of
emotional conflict. It can be
come a learned coping skill
used to rechannel anger, sad
ness, anxiety, and even joy. The
destructive behavior can also be
learned from people in the
person's environment who
abuse themselves through other
destructive behaviors such as
alcohol and drug abuse. That
is why it is important for a per
son suffering from an eating
disorder to get therapy to find
a way out of the web of destruc
tion.

According to junior Julie
Wilmer, the campus wide push
to eliminate eating disorders
will be fueled by the commis
sion. "What we are trying to do
is slam the campus with infor
mation," she says. Packets will
be distributed to athletes, resi
dent advisors, and members of
the Greek system. The idea be
hind being so inclusive with
those receiving the packets is
to get everyone involved.

Williams lights up the
screen as the flamboyant owner
of a Miami nightclub. Armand
Goldman (Williams) has made
a home for himself above the
club with the show's star,
Starina—drag queen Albert
(Lane).

Armand's brief
twenty years ago with _
fitness mogul I
Katherine Archerl
(Christine Baranski, I
Marianne of tv'sl
Cybill) has left him I
with a son, Val I
(Futterman), whomB
she has never met. I
Armand and Albert
have raised Val and I
sent him off to college. I
Val returns from I
school announcing_^
that he is engaged to a

affair

girl he met there, and the happy
little household goes into a
frenzy. His engagement to Bar
bara (Calista Flockhart, star of
Fox's Ally McBeal), the daugh
ter of conservative senator
Kevin Keeley (Hackman),
could potentially cause trouble
for her prominent father's up
coming election.
Keeley is the vice-presi
dent of the Coalition for Moral
Order. The Keeleys' tranquil

political life has recently be
come shrouded in scandal fol
lowing the death of senator Eli
Jackson, the co-founder of the
coalition. Keeley decides that
the announcement of his
daughter's pending marriage
might undo some of the dam
age caused by the shady cir
cumstances surrounding
Jackson's death.

The Keeleys decide to
take a vacation to Miami to
hide from the press and to meet
their future in-laws. The only
problem is that Barbara hasn't
exactly told her parents the
whole truth about Val's family
life. They think he is from a
traditional ail-American family,
and Louise Keeley (Wiest) be
lieves that he is the cultural at
tache to Greece.
Val and Armand begin a

complete overhaul of then
lives. Armand and Albert have
to redecorate their flashy apart
ment and change their manner
isms. They also have to do
something about their con
spicuously gay maid, Agadot
(Azaria). Can they play it
straight?
Lane's performance is hi
larious, as he captivates the
audience as

the overly the
atrical Albert.
Hackman plays the con
servative sena
tor with ease;
it's as though
he was meant
to play that
part.
Futterman is
excellent as

_BiHIHHiV tne average
college guy
with a not-so-average family.
Azaria, who has recently been
in the film version of Charles
Dickens' Great Expectations, is
startlingly funny as the maid
aspiring to be a performer.
Williams gives a wonderful per
formance, playing the role with
deftness and sincerity.
This movie is indeed an
original. It is a witty twist on
the sentimental empty-nest
tale.


Do you know what you're sleeping with?

by Leah Bagley and Amanda
Swank Contributing Reporters
One in four people have
a sexually transmitted disease
(STD), which means that as you
look around, at least one per
son near you is infected. The
scariest part of these statistics
is that many people are asymp
tomatic, which means they are
not aware that they have an
STD, and therefore that they
can spread the disease unknow
ingly. STDs can be treated, but
few can be cured.
Human Papillomavirus
(HPV) is one of the most com
mon STDs; approximately 40
million Americans are infected
with it. Sexually active women
under the age of twenty-five are
the most susceptible to contract
this disease. HPV is rarelv dis¬

cussed and therefore the con
sequences are more dangerous.
The symptoms may not show
for months or even years, but
this disease can lead to cervical
cancer and infertility. Symp
toms appear as warts in the
genital area, or internal lesions.
HPV cannot be cured, only
"cleared" from the body with
treatment.
Chlamydia infects three
to four million Americans, in
cluding ten percent of all col
lege students. Eighty percent
of those who have contracted
chlamydia show no symptoms.
Symptoms can include whitish
discharge for males, and itch
ing, burning, and discomfort in
the genital area for women.
Women who are infected have
a high risk of developing pel
vic inflammatory disease,
which ran lead to infertility.

Treatments for chlamydia in
clude antibiotics and erythro
mycin.
Syphilis is categorized
into three levels of seventy de
pending on the symptoms. The
primary stage includes painless
chancre on the external geni
tals. The secondary stage
symptoms are skin lesions and
achiness. The tertiary stage
includes lesions and problems
within the nervous system. The
only treatment for syphilis is
penicillin and the disease may
remain contagious for life.
Each year, more than
600,000 cases of gonorrhea are
reported. Symptoms for men
include milky white discharge
and a burning sensation when
urinating. Females experience
abnormal vaginal discharge and
inflammation of the vagina, but
80 percent of women do not

show any symptoms. Gonor
rhea can also lead to pelvic in
flammatory disease and, when
passed from mother to fetus,
may cause blindness to an in
fant. Penicillin is the only treat
ment. Genital herpes affects
half a million people each year,
and there is no cure, only sup
pression treatments. Symp
toms are lesions, warts, and
blisters which can be either in
the genital area or in the
mouth. If left untreated, a fe
vefmay result which may cause
meningitis and extremely pain
ful sores. Washing with soap
and water twice daily is a
simple at-home treatment;
painting lesions with podophyl
lin must be done under a
physician's care.

AIDS is the most well
known STD because of the epi

demic proportions that it has
reached. Young women who
are sexually active are the most
high risk group for contracting
\IDS. As we all know, there is
no cure for the virus, but there
are treatments to prolong the
life of the infected person.
The most preventative
measure for avoiding the con
traction of an STD is absti
nence, but if you are sexually
active, wearing a condom will
greatly decrease your chances
of becoming infected. Some
STDs are transferred by just
rubbing or touching the in
fected areas. Being aware that
all of us need to take precau
tions against all STDs, not only
AIDS, is our best defense
against the spread of these dis
eases. All STDs have the po
tential to change the direction
of vour life forever.

Kline Theater on Thursday,
February 26. Produced by the
College's theater arts depart
ment, the musical features the
Owl and Nightingale Players.
Based on the book The
Cotton Patch Version of Mat
thew and John by Clarence Jor
dan, Cotton Patch Gospel is set
in the South and tells the story
of the life of Jesus in very

American terms. Bethlehem
becomes Gainesville, Georgia,
while Jerusalem is represented
by Atlanta. Although the story
adheres closely to the Gospels,
the interpretation, the charac
ters, and the music are very
American.
The music is primarily
bluegrass. The songs range
from the rousing opening
"Somethin' Brewin' in
Gainesville" to Herod's aggres
sive declaration "I Did It." The
neighbors sing that "It Ain't
Easy Growing Up to be Jesus,"
but later state that he is indeed

a "Dangerous Man." Mary and
Joseph offer the plaintive and
beautiful "You are Still My
Boy," while the entire company
joins in for the high-spirited
"Goin' to Atlanta." The play is
brimming with good humor,
and the music is sure to set the

audiences toes a-tapping.
The director of Cotton
Patch Gospel is Professor Emile
O. Schmidt, and the designer
of the production is Professor
Jerome O. Hanson, both mem
bers of the College's theater
arts department. Visiting pro
fessional artists engaged for the
production include musical di
rector Don Bollinger, choreog
rapher Paula Kellinger, and
New York designer Stephen
Quandt.
Seventeen members of
O&N perform more than sixty
roles. First year student Reco
Grisby is featured as Jesus,

Duncan Niederer as Matthew,
Jennifer MacMurtrie and Glen
Beck as Mary and Joseph, Tim
Johnsen and Paul Lapato as the
brothers Rock and Andy, Brad
Cerilli as John the Baptist, Phil
Anderson as Pilate, Alec
Beekmans as Jud, Megan
Manthey as Dr. Caiaphas, Jen
nifer Baumgartner and Hannah
Roth as Satans, Allison
Kennedy and Michael Harp as
TV evangelists Timmy and
Tanya, Justin Arnold as the
Heavenly Messenger,
Samantha Gregg as the Angel,
and Mary Cordero as the Rev
erend Troy.

In addition, each actor
plays several other roles.
The production staff in
cludes Ashley Brown and
Lauren Wells, stage managers;
Jody Robertson, master electri¬

cian; Allison Perry, costumes;
Christa Zuber, properties; Glen
Beck, publicity; and Corinna
Krauskopf and Brian
Hershfeld, shop supervisors.

Marriage of comedy 6c the 80's

by Dan Larkin and Mike Petro
Movie Columnists
Mike: I must confess, I
was really excited when I saw
that The Wedding Singer had
come to town. Given the fact
that I find Happy Gilmore and
Billy Madison such fun, it-was
a natural reaction for me to get
excited. I figured that Adam
Sandier set to the tune of the
1980's would be an instant
recipe for movie hilarity. '
Dan: I admit that I'm
generally a bit of a snob when
it comes to my taste in movies
But darn it, I'm a sucker for
Adam _handler's low-brow cin
ematic exploits, too. It's a bit
of a guilty pleasure, but Billy
Madison makes me laugh like
few other movies can, no mat
ter how many times I watch it.
So I was looking forward to 1 this

one. Well, I won't keep you in
suspense for too long. I really
liked this movie. What Adam
Sandier and his writers, includ
ing Carrie Fisher, the queen of
the romantic comedy, have pro
duced is a wackv and eniovable

romantic comedy with characters
that are just fiat out fun.
Adam Sandier (Shakes the
Clown, Airheads) plays Robby
Hart, the best wedding singer in
town. After being left at the al
tar, Robby Spins into depression.
It takes the companionship of a
friendly waitress Julia, played by
Drew Barrymore (_Ftrestarter,
Bad Girls) to break him out of
his funk.
But Julia is set to marry
creepy the Don Johnson wanna
be, Glenn, played by Matthew
Glave ('Baby's Day Out, "Jag "),

so Robby's on a mission to win
her over.
Fans ofSandler's expecting
The Wedding Singer to be filled
with the nonstop, in-your-face,
ridiculousness of Billy Madison
and Happy Gilmore won't find
that here. But that's no reason
not to enjoy The Wedding Singer.
The humor is bit more restrained,
but it's still a very funny movie.
Sandier does a nice job coupling
comedy with a touching roman
tic story. The comedy/romance
marriage usually fails miserably
but it works well here.
This movie is good fun. I

enjoyed the actors and, unlike
his other movies, which are
pure silliness, this movie ac
tually attempts a plot, and
doesn't do a bad job with it.
While I disagree that his
other movies have no plot
(getting through grades 1-12
in six months, winning the pro
golf tour to save grandma's
house, these are plots), but I'll
concede that The Wedding
Singer is a bit more story ori
ented than Sandler's other
films. Setting the movie in
1985 is what provides the
movie with its goofy charm
(Billy Idol makes a guest ap
pearance!). The movie is filled
with great music from the
greed decade, and, unlike
Blues Brothers 2000, the mu
sic doesn't carry a lousy
movie, but compliments a
good one.
1 enjoyed The Wedding
Singer. / give it three and a
half stars (out of five).

I give The Wedding
Singer three and a half out
of five stars for just letting
you have fun with a movie.
Go see it.

also be having a learning lunch
on Wednesday at noon, at
which survivors of eating dis
orders, on both the friendship
and personal level, will talk.
This event and others will be
listed in the Gettysburgian this
week. Parker also made known
that it is important for men to
work at reversing eating disor
ders. "Both women and men
need to stand up." Both of the
sexes need to take the pressure
off of each other and to be
more accepting of individual
differences. Parker also added
that people's values should be
inclusive.
There exists an even more
unfortunate side of the disor
der. The problem is not get
ting better; it is getting worse.
More men are coming in with
disorders that stem some of the
time from sports dieting.

According to Wilmer, "Al
though eating disorders are
commonly perceived as a fe
male disease, you cannot ignore
the percentage of men with the
disorders."
If vou are concerned

about your own eating habits
or those of a friend, there are
places to turn. . Parker states
that you should be calm with a
person you think has a disor
der, and not berate them.
Tell them that the behav¬

you are ng scares you.
Discuss your concerns with a
professional, but realize you
may be rejected.
Do not, however, take the
role of counselor or monitor
food. It could cause more harm
in the long run.
If you are concerned that
you might have an eating dis
order, you should seek help. A
small percentage of people are
able to get better on their own,
but the majority need help.
There are also organiza
tions you can contact both in
the community and nationally.
The best thing you can
do, however, is accept who you
are and realize everyone is dif
ferent. That, according to all
three women, is the focus for
next week. Accepting everyone
is a goal the task force hopes
to accomplish through next
week's events.


Library BULLETin

by Libby Musselman
Library Columnist
Q: Dear Libby, I can't
study in ray room—it's too
noisy. And the library is a so
cial center. Where can I get
some quiet?
The second, third and
fourth floors are for quiet
study. I recommend the
fourth floor study carrels and
the third floor study bays. The
first floor can't be a quiet area
because of the circulation
desk, reference desk, and of
fices, and neither can the
ground floor, which has pho
tocopiers, the computer lab,
and media services. We can't
make every floor quiet, but
levels two, three, and four are
designated quiet floors.

Q.: Dear Libby, I've
come to the library in the
morning three times this se
mester to take out a reserve
video, and each time, it hasn't
been returned yet! How can I
find out who has it? Don't
worry, you won't be named as
an accessory.
Unfortunately for you,
PA law - Title 24 P.S. Section
4428 (PA Act 198490, Sec
tion 428) declares all library
circulation and borrower
records are confidential. Fur
thermore, the American Li
brary Association's Code of
Ethics promises to "protect
each library user's right to
privacy and confidentiality

with respect to information
sought or received and resources
consulted, borrowed, acquired,
or transmitted." Of course—if
you were the one in question—
you'd be happy this protection
was in place. The only recourse
you have is to complain to your
professor that the reserves are
unavailable when you've needed
them. One action that your pro
fessor could take would be to
curtail everyone's ability to take
the reserve item from the library
at all—but we don't want that,
do we? The best solution is for
people to be timely in returning
the reserve items they check out.
Libby's tip of the week: If
you need a book that has been
checked out, the library can re
call any book or put a "hold" on
it for you. If it is an emergency
and you are sure that someone
else in your class has it, some
one will call that person and see
if he or she is willing to share.

When you drop in: Check
out the display cases on the first
floor of the library. The four
cases include pictures and art
from students who went on the
winter break service learning
trips and contributed materials
to the displays. The four service
learning sites: Luther Place,
Washington, D.C.; Woodside,
Jamaica; Greene County, Ala
bama; and Cajamarca, Peru.

From the Donkey's Mouth

Al Gore for president

by Libby Main
Political _Columnist
Despite the investigation
of many of President Clinton's
closest confidants and staff
members, one key political
player has escaped connection
to the nasty Lewinsky scandal.
Vice President Al Gore, as
usual, remains unconnected to
allegations of wrongdoing. And
yet Gore is behaving appropri
ately by standing behind the
president without directly ad
dressing the scandal. Along
with a high level of morality,
there are many other positive
aspects of Al Gores intellect
and character which make him
the best candidate for president
in the year 2000.
Americans who think that
Al has escaped charges because
he is an uninvolved vice presi¬

dent are uninformed. Since
taking office in 1993, Gore has
been actively involved in the
formulation of many executive
policies.
Gore conducted a now
famous survey of the efficacy
of the federal government
which produced hundreds of
specific recommendations and
cost savings reforms to improve
the government and save tax
payers money. Gore also
served as chair of the Violent
Crime Control and Law En
forcement Act of 1994's Crime
Prevention Council. In the
realm of foreign policy, Al Gore
is integrally involved as a co
chair of several binational com
missions.
Al Gore's commitment to
and leadership on environmen
tal issues is unparalleled. He
has said that protection and

preservation of the earth is one
of the most important issues
facing this generation. Acting
upon his concerns, Gore estab
lished the GLOBE program to
increase environmental aware
ness among children around
the world.
Gore is also very knowl
edgeable in the areas of science,
space and technology policy.
He was aware of the introduc
tion of the Information Super
Highway almost 17 years ago,
and since then has become a
recognized national leader in
the development of the Na
tional Information
Infostructure. A president who
is familiar with computer tech
nology would help focus na
tional efforts to help America
regain strength in the global
marketplace.
Al Gore is a caring, intel¬

ligent individual. He has the
experience in government,
strength of character, an'd dedi
cation to issues that will affect
this country for the better that
America needs. Yes, Al Gore
appears stiff and uncomfort
able in front of television, cam
eras, but he is at ease when
meeting one on one with gov
ernment leaders.
Gore is the son of former
U.S. Senator Albert Gore, Sr.
and he was raised in both Ten
nessee and Washington as a re
sult of his fathers government
career. Al Jr received a degree
in government with honors
from Harvard University where
he roomed with famous actor
Tommy Lee Jones. After gradu
ation, Gore voluntarily enlisted
in the Army and served in Viet
nam. After his military service,
Gore attended Vanderbilt Uni¬

versity, married Mary Elizabeth
Tipper Aitchenson and eventu
ally ran for the U.S. Congress.
Gore won an election in 1976
and served eight years in the
House. He was then elected to
the U.S. Senate in 1984 and
1990. Al Gore would make
an excellent U.S. President.
On a different topic, I
would like to commend Presi
dent Clinton for considering a
tough policy stand against Iraq.
Persons who criticized
Clinton's lack of military expe
rience have to admit that the
President is taking a hard-line
approach to keep the U.S./U.N
inspection going. A possible
bombing of Baghdad is a much
more decisive move than
former veteran and President,
George Bush decided upon.
Lets not forget that Al Gore is
a veteran! Gore 2000!



nPQ The Greek Word IKN

by Earl Redding
IFC Public Relations
Greek life is back and in
full swing this semester as the
three and a half weeks of
pledging come to a half way
point. In total, about 150 men
and 90 women are pledging
our 11 Fraternities and 5 So
rorities. This year, however,
Alpha Xi Delta hopefully be
came trailblazers as they
dropped out of formal rush
after the first weekend and
decided to rush informally
with many events such as
mocktails before the Snow
Ball. All of the Greek commu
nity wishes Alpha Xi the best.
The sorority pledges
were busy this past weekend
at Chi Omega's annual Mr.
Fraternity where they danced
and sang in commercials. The
Chi Omega pledges ended the
highly eventful evening to
Mase's "Bad Boy" while Delta
Gamma, Gamma Phi Beta, Al¬

pha Delta Pi, and Alpha Xi
Delta also livened up the crowd
with routines. The highlight of
the evening though was the Mr.
Fraternity contest.
Tony DeFail of Alpha Chi
Rho took home the crown with
a stellar and steady perfor
mance that captivated the
crowd with his rendition of
Sublime'a "What I Got," and
was helped out by the guitar
playing of Mike Soltesz. Mike
Ben'ary of Fiji was the runner
up with his performance high
lighted by his singing and pi
ano playing to Ben Folds Five's
"Brick". Gary Lawson of Phi
Sigma Kappa was second run
ner-up also with a steady per
formance. The biggest cheers
however, were given to the
cowboy who was not partici
pating in Mr. Fraternity but
wowed the female audience
with a strip tease.

This weekend will also be
busy among Greeks as Sigma
Alpha Epsilon and Alpha Delta

Pi team up to host a Mardi Gras
dance-a-thon on Friday night
to benefit the Ronald
McDonald House. Everyone
on campus is invited, and the
last person dancing will win a
hundred dollars as well as the
best male and female dancers
will be crowned King and
Queen of Mardi Gras. Please
participate and show your sup
port for a worthwhile cause.
Next weekend, the 27th
of February, Sigma Nu will be
hosting MANDAY HUGE, a
band from Nags Head, North
Carolina from 10-1 pm for
an all campus BYOB party. The
event is helped by the $50,000
Dr. Haaland has given to the
student body. If you would like
to check out more information
on MANDAY HUGE, you can
visit their web-site at http://
www.mandayhuge.com.
Again, good luck to all
the pledges and congratulations
to Tony DeFail, Mr. Fraternity,

Strike down the tyrant

by LA. Isherwood
Columnist

the matter is that everyday the
United States government is
sending hundreds of troops and
supplies to the Middle East in
anticipation of military conflict
with the tyrant, Saddam
Hussein. Why is there now the
possibility of war?
In 1991, the Gulf War
came to a close after the Iraqi
army crumpled under the force
of the allied coalition to free
Kuwait. Most of us undoubt
edly remember watching the
nightly news, anticipating our
victory over such an evil little
man as Saddam Hussein. The
United States was, for the first
time since Vietnam, in favor of

see Tyrant

Carl von Clausewitz, a
nineteenth-century military
tactician, stated that "the aim
of all action in war is to disarm
the enemy." Such a statement
concerning the ever-prevalent
war with Iraq is quite accurate
concerning United States
policy.
Over the weekend, I was
appalled to discover the
plethora of people across our
campus not remotely aware of
the current crisis in the Gulf. I
know that at college sometimes
it is difficult to keep in touch
with current events, but when
one's nation is on the brink of
war, such negligence becomes
intolerable. The simple fact of

As with any college cam
pus, eating disorders are a not
so-hidden reality at Gettysburg
College. With National Eating
Disorder Awareness Week
coming up, the campus com
munity needs to make a spe
cial effort not only to acknowl
edge the presence of the prob
lem within its own institutions
and student body, but to search
for causes and propose solu
tions. Are there things on this
campus that promote eating
disorders?'Sources say yes.
Take a look at the wrestling
team...how do you think some
of the lighter athletes maintain
such a low weight level in a
sport that requires a large
amount of muscle?
And what about the
Greek system? Though hazing
is illegal on this campus, cer
tain sororities still seem to 'en
courage' their pledges to as
semble for a review dressed in
only their underwear, during

which the 'problem areas' or
their bodies will be circled with
black magic marker.
Though these are just a
few incidents out of what is
most likely a countless amount,
it is apparent that some activi
ties supported by the college
encourage unhealthy eating
behaviors. Although most
people do not realize the ex
tent to which these forces cre
ate low self-esteem and poor
body image, they indeed have
a serious impact upon the way
that students look at them
selves in the mirror each morn
ing. When a thin woman
looks in the mirror and sees
nothing but fat, and when an
athlete cannot afford to gain
even a pound or two without
the fear that they will be un
able to compete in the next
competition, there is a prob
lem. The college has contrib
uted to this situation by not
doing enough to educate stu
dents about the dangers of
these actions.
The upcoming programs
intended to inform and edu
cate our students will hopefully
be the first step in creating a
healthier campus environment.

Greek problems

by Jay Spiese
Columnist We are now full swing
into the time that organiza
tion leaders fear. Every club
and activity around campus
experiences a drop in mem
bership and participation. It
is tragic that students are
forced to choose between
participating in many activi
ties around campus and be
coming Greek.
The problem we find
with Greek society is two
fold. First we lose members
to what is basically a drink
ing club. My Greek readers
are surely, at this point, go
ing to spout off their tired
refrain, "We do more than
just party." You can point to
perhaps one or two philan¬

thropic events that your group
organizes each year. If you
include participation in events
organized by other groups
then it does appear like you
actually do some good for the
campus. I, however, hold you
to the same standard as other
clubs. I will not accept your
participation in an activity you
did not organize as evidence of
your positive contribution to
this campus. When that is
taken away we are left with
only drinking and partying.
Secondly, Greek society
is not composed of individu
als as much as herds. The T
shirt I used to see sorority
members wearing unintention
ally stated the truth, "No mat
ter what the letter, we are all
Greek together." It is amazing
how soon after rush people

follow their Greek brothers
and sisters like so many cattle.
People who used to think on
their own now resign them
selves to accepting the views of
the group. This is arguably the
gravest harm that Greek soci
ety causes on this campus.
They are a stifling influence on
the individual.
I praise those individuals
who have rebelled against
Greek life by leaving
their Fraternity or Sororit
. I also support all indepen
dents. You are the individual
voices on campus that make the
difference. I also hope that
many of those pledging this
year take a long hard look at
the group they are joining. Do
not surrender your individual
ity to the mob. Be independent
rather than a slave.


by Cammie Grant
Columnist The current hot topic
in the world is Operation
Desert Thunder. American
military forces are lining up
in the Persian Gulf. The
United States, Britain, Aus
tralia, Canada, Poland, Por
tugal, Germany, Sweden,
Norway and Brazil are the
countries who are support
ing the . use of force in the
Persian Gulf. The primary
question facing the countries
is what their main objective
is; is it to eliminate Saddam
Hussein's chemical and bio
logical weapons or is it to
end Saddam Hussein en
tirely? I support the Clinton

administration slogan regard
ing this potentially harmful
situation, "no more pin
pricks." For years now, the
United States has been in
volved with Iraq, and it is time
to take action, once and for all.
Hussein is a dangerous threat
to surrounding countries and
production of weapons of
mass destruction is hazardous
to the world. Saddam had
toyed around with our leaders
for years and it has reached a
point of possible mass destruc
tion. It is time for us and our
allied forces to move in, and
at the very least, make an ef
fort to eliminate all chances for
the further production of
chemical and biological weap
ons and to destroy all existing
weapons of mass destruction.

Many people do not realize the
destructive capability these
weapons possess. Inhaling a
small dust particle of Anthrax
is fatal. It is also thought that
Hussein also has the supplies to
end all life on Earth.
Countries need to unite
and support a common effort
to "disarm" Saddam Hussein.
He is an incredible danger not
only to his neighboring coun
tries, but our entire world.
Within the next couple of
weeks, I expect that there will
be action taken. According to
U.S.A. Today, opinion polls
show support exists for air
strikes.
It is time for Americans
to come together with support
ing countries.

The Pachyderm's Pulpit

A look at our college

by John Dunlap
Political Columnist
If I may, this week I
would like to take a break from
my normal tirade on national
politics or the latest scandal hit
ting the country. The politics
that I wish to concentrate on
this week are right here at Get
tysburg College. Next week
are the elections for the Execu
tive Board of Student Senate,
and following those elections,
regular Student Senate and
Class Officer elections will oc¬

cur. This past year has been a
pretty good year for Student
Senate. Just last Monday, a ma
jor victory for fairness was an
nounced during Senate as Dean
Julie Ramsey read a letter
signed by President Haaland
allowing for international stu
dents to receive financial aid to
go abroad, just like any other
student is able to. Senate has
been fighting for fairness on
this issue for longer than I have
been around, and this is a vic
tory for the entire campus.
Student Senate this past
year has made a great deal of
progress in regard to issues

dealing with the social life on
the campus. Two committees
are now working to improve
the social climate. One of these
committees has been given the
power to appropriate fifty
thousand dollars in order to
make Gettysburg a better place
to live and work. The other
committee is looking to solve
long term social issues, by pos
sibly bringing either a dance
club or bar to campus. Solu
tions to the problem that I
wholeheartedly agree with. We
now need to push it from' the
idea stage to the implementa
tion stage.
Improving the social cli
mate of our College is some
thing that we all need to be a
part of. The reaction to the
fifty thousand-dollar fund has
been strong; hopefully students
are sending a message to the
administration that we are in¬

terested in social change. One
of things which I would like to
see done is having the quarry
used once again for concerts
and all-campus parties.
More all-campus parties
would take pressure off of the
Greek system. For those who
criticize Greek organizations,

Gettysburg College needs to
realize that it owes its fraterni
ties and sororities a lot. For
years they have been the social
backbone for this college, and
now with new regulations and
the enactment of BYOB, they
have hit a period of transition.
As Treasurer of my fraternity I
am seeing how it is not easy to
run a Greek organization, but
we, as a College should be com
mitted to preserving.the Greek
System on this campus. That
starts with saving Alpha XI
Delta and keeping the Greek
system independent. By inde
pendent I mean keeping the
Greek Judicial system and not
replacing its duties with
theStudent Conduct Review
Board, as some wish.

With the College looking
at long term planning, the
housing crunch is the immedi
ate concern. Students should
not have to live at the Seminary
Not to mention that another
reason that fraternities are im
portant now is because they
house students.
Academically, som of the
ideas being examined for the
future are mixed. The college's
decision not to keep J. Martin

demic experience of my life
occurred this year with the Eu
ropean Union Simulation,
taught by Dr. DeClair. I would
bet every one of my classmates
would agree with me in regards
to the EU Simulation. Now,
not only will Dr. DeClair be
leaving Gettysburg College, the
EU Simulation is being dropped
for the time being. The Euro
pean Union is our College's
only academic competition and
year after year Gettysburg does
well. This year was no excep
tion. It could be said that we

Holman of the Japanese Stud
ies program is unbelievable.
Many of my friends in his Japa
nese classes have said that he
has been quite influential in
their college experiences. Not
only is Mr. Holman well liked
by his students and held in high
regard, this school should be
striving towards a strong Japa
nese Department. There seems
to be no logical reason not to
create a tenure track position.
There has not and will not even
be a Japanese Professor on the
tenure track at Gettysburg.
Having a strong Japanese De-

as students sometimes expect a
lot, but you know we pay a lot
to go here.
I do encourage anyone
who wants to get involved to
run for Student Senate or Class
Office. Student Senate should
be more open and expanded.
It should be a place of debate
and discussion for the campus
community. Student Senate
must succeed when the admin
istration fails us. Student Sen
ate must be responsive to our
concerns when the administra
tion ignores us. Student Sen
ate is our outlet to the admin
istration and the faculty.

partment is vitally important
when one looks at he world
today and the state of interna
tional trade.
Earlier this year President
Haaland in response to the law
suit over tenure, declared that
the court victory meant that
tenure worked; he was wrong.
For two years in a row, the con
cerns of students were not ad
equately heard during the ten
ure process. Last year, with Dr.
Edward DeClair of the Politi
cal Science Department, and
this year with the decision to
not create a position for Mr.
Holman. The greatest aca-


Tyrant

- continued from page 10 -
a war which was quick, deci
sive, and had only a moderate
loss of life. Now we are faced
with the same despotic govern
ment which our tanks and
planes hoped to eradicate in
1991. Again, our forces are
massing in the Gulf, anticipat
ing what could, within the next
few weeks, become another
war. I believe these military
actions are in the right consid
ering what e have tried to ac
complish over the last seven
years. When the Iraqi govern
ment signed the cease fire that
ended the Gulf War, they

opened their country to United
Nation's sanctions which in
clude the inspection of facili
ties allegedly used for chemi
cal and biological weapons of
mass destruction.
Over seven years, the
government of Iraq has led UN
officials on a wild goose chase
which has finally led to an in
ternational conflict due to the
barring of United States inspec
tors from these laboratories.
The United States will not tol
erate such resistance, the vio
lation of United Nation's pre
cedents, and the treaty of
1991.

The simple fact of the
matter is that this third world
terrorist is a threat to our for
eign policy within the region
and has repeatedly tried to hurt
our interests. He is a tyrant who
has killed hundreds of thou
sands of his own people to keep
his regime afloat. He has used
weapons of mass destruction on
other nations as well as on par
tisan groups within his nation.
He is a threat to freedom and
democracy, two of the ideals
which we hold so dear, and is
causing his own people harm.
Our foreign policy is not against
the people of Iraq, but rather

this evil person who calls him
self their leader. He must be
stopped, and if the greatest
army in the world won't do it,
who will?
Carl von Clausewitz also
said that "war is the continua
tion of politics by other
means," and our policy now is
that when diplomacy fails
(which it is rapidly doing), war
must take place. The regime
of Saddam Hussein is irratio
nal and fanatical, and politics
has shown that little progress
can be made with such a per
son. Thus, if diplomacy fails,
we must intervene and disarm

the enemy by force and with
great speed and strength. If we
commit force, then may our
armed forces do everything
necessary to destroy the Iraqi
army, their capability for mak
ing weapons of mass destruc
tion, and the government of
Saddam Hussein. Iraq needs to
be free, the people want to be
free, and a genocidal maniac
prevents such freedom. We
must then free Iraq from
Saddam Hussein, and force is
necessary, we as Americans for
the sanctity of our values
should support such action.

Last Saturday Gettysburg
wrestlers senior Jake Dell and
junior Marty Scarpato proved
themselves able to dominate
their respective weight classes.
Jake became only the second
wrestler ever to win four con
secutive Centennial Confer
ence championships.
With a pin, Dell, the top
rated wrestler in Division III,
boosted his incredible season
record to 33-1. It took Dell
four minutes and nineteen sec
onds to pin Ursinus College
Junior Nate McElhaney and
clinch first place in the 167
pound class.

Marty has definitely "scrapped" his way to the top

by Western Wells
B.A.S.S. Member/Contributing
Reporter Marty "Scrap" Scarpato
is a wrestler at Gettysburg Col
lege. He started his wrestling
career during his middle school
days back home. Before com
ing to Gettysburg, Iviarty
played baseball and ran cross
country in addition to wres
tling. "Scrap" is one of four sib
lings who have also been com
petitive in wrestling. When
asked about his passion for
wrestling, he simply stated that

Marty "Scrap" Scarpato
_Spott: Wrestling
Age: 20
YOG: \m

Personal Record: 23-9

he has been in it for years be
cause it has been in the family
"It's something that has always
been a part of my life, and I
keep going at it."
One bad memory that
might have hindered his pas
sion for wrestling was an injury
which he suffered in high
school.
Although "Scrap" had
not been pinned to the mat that
day, he had to leave with his
back flat on a stretcher. Marty
had suffered from a neck sprain
that surely scared many in the
crowd, but he healed fairly
quickly.
Like any good athlete,
Marty did not withdraw from
the sport and his tenacity pre
vailed. For those who don't
know yet, Marty will be going
to Iowa for Nationals this

weekend. He's looking for
ward to doing well among the
competition and also keeping
Jake Dell company. He feels
that this could be his big shot

it jL,
for national achievement.
He reflects back on his
season and gives his thanks to
Coach Troy Dell. Marty hopes
Coach Dell will get the full time

job as their coach. "He really
puts forth the time and effort
to make a significant differ
ence. At first, his age was ques
tionable, but soon Coach Dell's

vWvHvsseF'H
H_^ eXrjjSS-HEWj
experience prevailed."
Marty will be in Iowa for
the weekend with Jake; let's
hope all their passion pays off
in Nationals, good luck!



In case you missed it...
Hodakowski shows off his stuff in Division III Senior Bowl

by Steve Jenkins
Sports Editor
If this article would have
never been published in the
Gettysburgian, you would
never know about the mild
mannered, well groomed Bul
lets football captain named Joe
Hodakowski. Hodokowski has
been smashing the oppostion
into the ground in Mussleman
Stadium for four years and re
cently he reached the pinnacle
of his outstanding career.
On Januai y \_9, in a
snowy Fayetteville North Caro
lina, 78 of the nation's top se
nior Division III football play
ers assembled for the annual for
the USA Division III Martin
Luther King Holiday All-Star
Classic.

Hodakowski, who was
named a third team All-Amen
can for his perfomances on the
field this year, was invited to
the game to play along side
some of the top college players
in the nation.
Joe who you ask? We had
an All-Amencan on our foot
ball team this year? Yes, we did.
He wouldn't tell you if you
asked him though, rather he

would give you and answer
like, "I was part of a team, as
far as I am concerned the team
is responsible for my sucess. I
just go out and do the best I
can for them. That's all."
"Hodo" as his friends
call him, always gave all he
could for the best of the team
and perhaps that was why he
was chosen as team captain this
season. But on January 19, the
little man with the huge heart
ran into Douglas Byrd stadium
as one of the best in the nation.
But he is only five feet,
nine inches tall, and only
wieghs two-hundred pounds;
how did he hold up against the
best players in the nation? He
did more than ]ust "hold up."
Playing beside three other Di
vision III All-Amencans on the
same defensive line,
Hodakowski racked up 7 tack
les one of which was a
quaterback sack.

Hah. So much for the
big, ugly guys always being the
best football players. To rack
up those kind of stats Joe must
have used his strength, quick
ness and desire to win to over
come the sometime 300 hun
dred pound odds.

Number #54 Joe "Hodo" Hodakowski, quietly moves to assault this opposing passer.

"What thrill to play
against the best D-III players in
the country," said a smiling,
mud-splattered Hodakowski
after the game. "Here we come
the North Carolina and it
snows. It is something I will

never forget."
Although his name was
never printed in big letters (ex
cept today) and not everybody
knows his name, Joe
Hodakowski has left a perma
nent mark not only on football
team, but the collge as well. Joe

said that the game was some
thing that he will never forget;
well Joe, none of your coaches,
teammates and friends will ever
be able to forget you. Thank
you for being a part of our lives
for the last four years. It was
special.

sophomore Drew Lavenberg at
shortstop. Thorpe is coming off
an excellent senior season and
should prove to be an excellent
first year player in the colle
giate ranks.
Campo considers
Lavenberg to be the best Bullet
shortstop in his thirteen years
of coaching. Offensively, Drew
provides Gettysburg with an
exceptional bunter who can
complement the heavy bats and
work within the running game.
Behind the plate, the Bul
lets have two returning catch
ers. J ack Tanner, a sophomore,
and Ken Rittenhouse, a junior,
should effectively regulate the
baselines this spring as both are
excellent defensive ballplayers.
Campo plans to split the play¬

ing time 50/50 this season in
an effort to avoid exposing ei
ther player to injury from the
wear and tear of everyday
catching. "We have a great
group of guys this year. They
all share a great work ethic to
go along with great ability. I
think we have a legitimate shot
at the Cenntenial Conference
Championship," said Campo.
John Woods re
marked, "We have a really
young team this season and that
can cause problems. Our suc
cess will depend on how well
we are able to gell. I think we
should be able to come to
gether and play competitively
in the games that count this
season."

game is as strong as it has ever
been. Malloy, coming off an
ankle injury, is averaging nine
rebounds a game as well as 8.2
points. Dawson, who picked
up the slack during Malloy's
injury, is averaging 5.1 re
bounds and 7.9 points.
Dawson is Gettysburg's top
shooter landing 75 of her 135
attempts for 56 percent.
Another pleasant suprise
has been the inside play of
sophomore Megan McDonald.
Not only is she averaging 3.7
rebounds a game, but she has
an amazing 24 blocked shots to
her credit as well as 30 steals.
She is averaging a little over

Bullets reload for new season with Woods, Lunardi, and Lavenburg

If the young talent can come together, these Bullets are aimed at success

by Ted Hartman
Contributing Reporter
The Bullets baseball team
finished strong in the closing
weeks of the 1997 season, win
ning twelve of their last eigh
teen games. Coach John
Campo is hopeful that this suc
cess will continue into the
Spring of 1998, and considers
this squad a viable contender
for the Cenntenial Conference
championship.
Gettysburg's pitching
staff features proven consis
tency in its returning arms.
Sophomores Dan Sirpinski and
Paul Koether are expected to
step up this Spring and provide
the Bullets with reliable perfor
mances after sizable contribu
tions as freshmen. PJ McElroy,
also a sophomore, shares this
potential and will fill the third
position in the rotation.

Campo is not yet sure
which of his remaining seven
hurlers will be designated the
fourth starter. Juniors Pete
Rittenhouse and Matt
DeVecchi are both in conten
tion, with freshmen Tom Boob
and Drew Chiesa providing
competition as well. Out of the
bullpen the Bullets can look to
a strong group of young talents

for middle relief and late-in
mng closing.
Sophomore Jere Dee, a
first year player, is making a
smooth transition from outfield
to the mound. Ryan Sweeney
and Jeff Ellis, each freshmen,
showed an ability to pitch ef
fectively at the college level in
fall ball.
"Once we go down to
Florida we will be able to de
fine our roles better as far as
who will be middle and short
relief. Our pitching coach Lee
Rentzell is very optimistic
about this group," said Campo.
The Bullets are also en
thusiastic about their position
players. The outfield is stocked
with strong arms and speed in
sophomore Chris Lunardi, se
nior Daryl Clancy, both prob
able starters. Sophomore Greg
Kosc, and freshmen Bill Neston
and Jim Nestasi are all cur
rently vying for the remaining
position. Campo expects his
outfielders to he the table set¬

ters with an aggressive running
assault for the Bullet RBI men.
Sophomores John Woods
and Bill Beining should effec
tively plate the Gettysburg
lead-off hitters. The 1997 sea
son saw Woods tally 30 RBIs
and belt six home runs, to go

Bullet Outfilder Chris Lunardi takes a hack at an annarent weak nfferinn

along with his .404 batting av
erage. Combined with
Beining_'s power, the tandem
should make it impossible for
opposing pitching staffs to
pitch around the core of the
line-up. Though both are good
defensive first basemen, Woods
will take the field opening day,
while Beining will be slotted
as designated hitter.

"John Woods is an all
conference cabber ball player
and has the potential to be an
ail-American candidate. It is
rare to find a player that can
hit for such an average and for
great power. His six home runs
last season tied a school
record."
Third basemen Kevin
Grimm also offers power to the

Bullet arsenal. A sophomore
now, Grimm played the role of
backup infielder as a freshmen.
This year his speed and power
will most likely land him in the
heart of the Bullets order.
The middle infield will be
manned by frehsmen Bret
Thorpe at second base and

Dravis scores 1000

From Staff Reports
Despite a stunning 83-71
loss at the hands of Western
Maryland last week, the Get
tysburg College women's bas
ketball still has a bright post
season playoff picture.
Gettysburg and Western
Maryland are currently tied for
second place in the west divi
sion of the Centennial Confer
ence with 9-4 records. West
ern Maryland traveled to
league leading Johns Hopkins
(12-0 in Centennial) on
Wednesday. Gettysburg is
sporting a 16-6 overall record.
Gettysburg is currently
paced by a set of senior twins,
Jen and Steph Dravis. Steph is
the current scoring leader with
a 12.3 average and leads the
team with 51 assists. Jen is av
eraging 11.8 points a contest

and leads the team with 44
steals. However, it was Jen
who broke into the elite 1,000
point club last week and begins
the final week of the regular
seasons with 1,016 points.
Ironically enough, her 1,000th
point came on an assist from
sister Steph. She is the fifth
Gettysburg female player to hit
1000. Steph Dravis still has a
long shot of hitting 1000
points, provided Gettysburg
reaches the playoffs. She
curently has 913. Although six
other players are quite capable
of knocking down three-point
goals in a given situation, the
Dravis twins are the team lead
ers. Steph has 31 percent of
112 attempts and Jen 29 per
cent of 116 tries.

Injuries hampered
by Paul Redfern
Staff Reporter
The Gettysburg College
Men's Basketball team rolled
toward the playoffs upsetting
nationally ranked Johns
Hopkins University 52-46, and
eliminating Western Mary
land, 71-66 last week. The
Bullets are now tied with
Franklin and Marshall for sec
ond place in the Western Di
vision with a 7-4 record.

On Wednesday night
Johns Hopkins came to Get
tysburg after beating them 91
51 at Hopkins earlier in the
season. The only once beaten
JHU began the game well, but
the Bullets came firing back.
After the first few min
utes of play the score was tied
4-4. Then Gettysburg caught
fire. Greg Schrieber hit two
three pointers in a row fol
lowed by a third by Kevin
Carroll.

With the score 13-4 JHU
was forced to call timeout and
regroup. The assault did not
stop as the Bullets fueled by

the Bullets of late and it looked to dash their chances at playoffs; don't stop watching just yet

offense from Senior Terry
Schofield and Sophomore
Richie Pfiel continued to build
a lead that reached 17.
The Bullets went into the
half up 10 points and playing
well. In the second half JHU
made a comeback. Gettysburg
held strong with good team de
fense and solid offensive cuts.
Sophomores Bill Davidson and
Ryan Napp had positive offen
sive performances. JHU cut the
bullets lead to three only once
with a few minutes to play, but
the Bullets held on strong to fin
ish off the win, 52-46.
The Bullets entered
Saturday's contest with Western
Maryland needing a win to stay
alive in the playoff hunt. The
Bullets won what was an elimi
nation game by the score of 71
66.

Saturday was Senior day
which was preceded by the
Alumni game. Senior Terry
Schofield and John Bauersfeld
were honored for their contri
butions to Bullets Basketball
over the last four years.
Western Maryland had

Despite a roller-coaster season the Bullets are still in the hunt for a playoff berth.

beaten Gettysburg earlier in the
season and got off to a hot start.
But team defense and hard
work helped the Bullets bounce
back as Bauersfeld hit 2 early
jump shots. Junior Matt
Rothenburger helped the Bul
lets stay in the game with some
nice high post moves.
Carroll was hot from the
outside hitting several three
pointers as did Napp. Western
Maryland played tough and
took lead with 8 minutes to go

Jen Drevis takes the ball to the goal. For more see page 23

in the game. But the Bullets
aided by the cheers of alumni
and fans, fought back.
Davidson and Pfiel along
with Schofield played well on
both ends of the floor to give
the Bullets the victory 71-66.
The Bullets played
Ursinus last night, and travel
to Franklin and Marshall on
Saturday for the regular sea
son finale. The playoff sce
narios are as follow for the last
two games:
Two Bullet wins clinch

a playoff spot
OR If Gettysburg loses to
Ursinus and defeats Franklin
and Marshall there will then be
is a tie and a game Monday
Night at Gettysburg to decide
who advances
OR If Gettysburg loses to
Ursinus and Beats Franklin and
Marshall and Franklin and
Marshall lose to Dickinson the
Bullets are assured a playoff
spot.

Ziggy Marley to play Springfest concert
Grammy winning group chosen by SAC

Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers will play at the
Springfest concert on April 18. Opening acts Guster
and Ghetto Youth will also perform. Tickets go on sale
April 6. _^^

By Laura Root
Staff Reporter Ziggy Marley and
the Melody Makers will be
coming to Gettysburg on
Saturday, April 18. Open
ing for the Melody Mak
ers will be the bands
Guster and Ghetto Youth.
The Student Activi
ties Council (SAC) decided
that Ziggy Marley and the
Melody Makers were the
best choice after reviewing
the student surveys passed
out earlier this year.
Adam Norton and
Jackie Trottier, co chair
persons of the concert
committee, said that there
was a great demand on
campus for reggae music.
The band has re
ceived widespread praise,
and their new alburn,
Fallen Is Babylon, has been
nominated for a Grammy
Award.

"Ziggy Marley and
the Melody Makers aren't
a flash in the pan," sayi
Norton, "they have re
ceived both good record
and concert reviews."
Other bands being
considered for the Spring
Concert included Rusted
Root, Barenaked Ladies,
Third Rye Blind, Match
box 20, and Toad the Wet
Sprocket. After studying
the bands' schedules,
Norton and Trottier made
their hnal decision.
Opening band
Guster pLiys a unique type
of modern folk. They are
known for their outstand¬

ing live performances. The
Melody Makers are bring
ing an additional opening
band, Ghetto Youth with
them. Ziggy Marley and
the Melody Makers strive
to connect the rich reggae
roots with a variety of
today's popular music
styles. The band has sold
millions of records, toured
the globe, and won two
Grammy Awards.
Melody Makers
Sharon, Stephen, Cedella,
and Ziggy Marley are all
children of the late reggae
great, Bob Marley. More
than 20 other musicians
accompany the Marleys to
make up the band.

According to SAC,
the student response to the
Spring Concert has been
"outstanding." Reggae
record sales at K&K
Records have increased,
and Norton and Trottier
have heard nothing but
good things about their
choices.
"Guster has a strong
following," said Trottier,
"and the Melody Makers
fit the upbeat Springfest
theme."
A large turnout is ex
pected for the event. Tick
ets are set to go on sale
Monday, April 6.
"Everybody is look
ing forward to something
different," concluded
Norton, "They're excited
to come, and we're excited
to have them."

"The Commission has
been successful beyond our
greatest expectations," said Jim
Brenneman, chair of the Com
mission, a Gettysburg graduate,
and College trustee. "The
Commission members have
provided thoughtful and in
sightful perspectives on areas of
vital importance to the future
of the College, and their rec
ommendations will provide sig
nificant impetus to the Board
of Trustees as Gettysburg
moves forward in it's strategic
planning process."
The Commission com
prised task forces studying eco
nomics and management, ex
cellence in the sciences and psy

Run-off election
to be held
by Henry Fawell
Assistant News Editor
- The Student Senate elec
tions saw several new students
voted into office this week, yet
the most important position,
the Presidency, will have to be
decided in a runoff.
In accordance with the
Student Senate Constitution, a
presidential candidate must
obtain a majority vote from the
students to claim the position.
Yet none of the three candi
dates for the position, Sara
Zalewski, Earl Redding nor
John Dunlap could do so.
The run-off election will
be held between Zalewski and
Redding, most likely sometime
next week.

There were, however,
three new positions decided in
the elections. Emily Robertson
won the Vice Presidency, Liz
Walsh will be the new Secre
tary, and Lisa Wingenroth is
the new Treasurer.

The commirree still has retention.

more than $30,000 left to al
locate to students for social
events. In order to obtain fund
ing for its events, an organiza
tion must complete an applica
tion to be approved by the Stu
dent Life Committee.
In order to be approved
the event or function must
meet four cirtena established
by the committee. The event
must include the entire campus
or very large groups. The idea
must be approached in a fresh
and inovative way. The pro
grams should be sponsored by
unique partnerships between
campus organizations. The
events should be held in new
or different program locations.
Applications for event
proposals are available at the
information desk in the College
Union Building.
The Committee is com
prised of six students, Valerie
Katzmar, Becca O'Connell,
mark Astrom, Jen Gillete,
Rodwin Lowe, and Marcelo
Ardon. Students and organi
zation with questions are en
couraged to contact them.

"The successful
completion of the Commission
on the Future of Gettysburg
College will help the Board of
Trustees develop a clear action
plan for review and eventual
implementation for the benefit
of our current and future stu
dents, especially in relation to
programs, curriculum, and the
fostering of an active and dy
namic learning environment,"
said Gordon A. Haaland, Presi
dent of Gettysburg College.
"We here at Gettysburg express
our sincere thanks to all the
Commission members for their
hard work and to those mem
bers of the campus community
who served as information re
sources to the Commission
members."

The Board of Trustees
will use their next two meet
ings in May and September to
review the Commission's spe
cific recommendations and pri
oritize suggestions based on
strategic planning and budget
considerations.

Features
A sporting good time

by Cara Masucci
Staff Reporter Lately it seems as though
there is an increase in the
amount of time people are put
ting into working out and
maintaining a healthy body.
Nowhere is this more apparent
than here at Gettysburg Col
lege. Students at _k_^_kh

Gettysburg have a
wide variety of op
tions open to them in
order to achieve their
goals. This is thanks
to a large effort on the
part of the Campus
Recreation Depart
ment. There is a wide
variety of different
programs that anyone
on campus can join.
They range from
intramurals and club
sports to aerobics, spe
cial events, and finally
the fitness facilities.
A lot of work
goes into these pro
grams, according to
Director of Campus
Recreation Cynthia
Wright. First off, you
have to secure a facil
ity, advertise the event
and sign-ups, and hire
and train officials and

supervisors.
This is not all. It _^
is essential to work _t
with the Office of Col- -s
lege Life and Student

Basketball Is just one of the many Intramural sports offered by the Campus Recreation Department for all
tudents to play. If you have any questions about the programs, contact Cythia Wright or Barbara Streeter,

Senate,
which currently fund club
sports, in order to get every
thing off the ground.
Consequently, there are
hundreds of workers in Cam
pus Recreation. According to
Wright and her Assistant Direc
tor, Barbara Streeter, campus
recreation has always been one
of the most popular jobs on
campus. The workers do ev
erything from manning the fit
ness facilities to refereeing in
tramural events. According to
Wright, "Our programs would
not exist if not for the students

helping to run it."
Currently there are seven
intramural sports that Wright
oversees (Wright handles all
intramurals, club sports, and
fitness facilities, while Streeter
oversees special events and
aerobics). Flag football and
basketball appear to be the
most popular, drawing on

about 350 participants each.
Rounding out the seven
intramural sports available to
the campus are softball, indoor
and outdoor soccer, volleyball,
and floor hockey. All draw
roughly 200 participants each.
The intramurals are not
the only aspect of recreation
drawing high numbers. The
fitness facilities have seen a
jump to 1000 visitors a week,
not including athletic teams
according to Wright. Streeter
also points out that the aero
bics numbers have grown to
about 225 with this time of

year being the most populated.
Special events draw heavy
participation as well.
One improvement in
numbers that both Streeter and
Wright are happy to see is the
increase in women's participa
tion and co-ed participation in
al I aspects of campus recreation.
Wright stated, "The College is

really trying to make an effort
to have students interact in a
healthy environment."
One of the main goals in
cluded in the mission statement
of Campus Recreation is to fos
ter an environment conducive
to studying. If you can relieve
stress, as many students who
participate say they do, then
you are much more able to
study more efficiently and pro
ductively. The recreation gives
the students a chance to blow
off steam.
It might be e.isy to blow
off steam in recreation because,

as several students comment,
they make new friends and cul
tivate existing relationships.
is also easy to laugh when you
see your professor trying to
drive the lane in a game of bas
ketball!
Again, Wright feels this
emphasizes the goal of putting
everyone on the campus at an t,

equal level.
Intramurals are often run
in a round-robin setup, consist
ing of four to six weeks of play.
Then it advances to a one week
playoff round.
Special events, on the
other hand, are one-day events
that include such activities as
bench press, badminton, tennis
singles, ultimate Frisbee, and
4x4 volleyball.
What is positive about
the student involvement in rec
reation is that many of the stu
dents who participate in one
event are also involved in an-

other. It sustains a cycle of
healthy habits in exercise. All
of the programs are also sub
stance free.
Another unique quality
about participation in Campus
Recreation is that many varsity
sports teams join a different in
tramural team in the off-sea
son, as the women's soccer
team did.

I lo ensure that ev¬
erything is running
smoothly and that the
students are enjoying
themselves, the Depart
ment of Recreation sends
out evaluation forms to
see how programs are
holding up. Most of the
comments given are en
I couraging and reinforce
I the need for such activi¬

ties. The department is
also constantly searching
for suggestions and new
ideas on how to better
serve the students.
If anyone wants to
become part of the Cam
pus Recreation staff or
participate in recreation
on any level they should
contact Wright or
Streeter.
Both women also
pointed out the stress
they put on the fact that
anybody, no matter what
level of experience or tal
ent, can take place in any
of the activities listed.
lr

rurcnermore, a
team sport comes along, but an
individual cannot find a team
to join, they should contact the
department and they can be
entered on an existing team.
Wright can be contacted
at cwright or x6322. Streeter
can be contacted at bstreete at
x6323.
Wright uses a Thomas
Jefferson quote to demonstrate
the importance of campus rec
reation: "Exercise and recre
ation are as necessary as read
ing. I will say rather more nec
essary because health is worth
more than learning,"




Reel Hits & Misses
Sphere not much of a ball

by Dan Larkin and Mike Pctro
Movie columnists
Mike: Okay movie fans,
picture this. You are one of the
leading minds in the country in
your field, either mathematics,
astrophysics, biology, or psy
chology. You are called to in
vestigate a crash of a "space
craft" somewhere in the middle
of the Pacific Ocean, inside of
which you discover a perfect
sphere. Somehow you go in
side of this large orb and after
coming out, all of your dreams
and nightmares come true.
If you can picture this,
you might like the new Michael
Crichton movie Sphere.
Dan: I'm still having a
difficult time picturing that.
But I liked Sphere anyway.
Sphere is directed and produced
by Barry Levinson (Wag the

Dog, Sleeper;,), and while it
isn 't as memorable as some of
his other projects, it does have
its moments. I was fairly ap
prehensive about this movieie
membenng that my last expe
rience with a Michael Crichton
vehicle was The Lost World,
which I'm pietty sure is the
worst movie I have ever seen.
But, have no fear, Sphere is
much better than that dinosaur
flick. I went to see this movie
with admittedly low expecta
tions, and I actually came out
of the theater with it exceed
ing my expectations im
mensely. The movie features
an all-star cast with Dustin
Hoffman (Ishtar, Dick Tracy)
as Dr. Norman Goodman,
Samuel L. Jackson (National
Lampoon's Loaded Weapon,
The Great White Hype) as

Harry Adams, and Sharon
Stone (Action Jackson, Police
Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol)
as Beth Halperin.
Beyond these three stars,
who all turn in unique and in
teresting performances is an
excellent supporting cast. Pe
ter Coyote (E.T. The Extra-Ter
restrial, Outrageous Fortune)
plays Harold Barnes, the token
government spook, and Liev
Schreiber of Scream fame plays
Ted Fielding, the hot shot
physicist. Add in Queen
Latifah (Hoodlum, House
Party 2) and you've got your
self a cast!
The cast does a pretty
good job developing these
characters despite a fairly weak
script. The dialogue seems
forced and artificial through
most of the film. It is to the
credit of the actors (especially

Hoffman and Jackson) that
they are able to carry much of
the film with their personalities.
Jackson and Hoffman
have both bad particularly
good winters at the movies,
each following strong perfor
mances in Jackie Brown and
Wag the Dog, respectively, with
good jobs here. Stone's perfor
mance, however, isn't as strong
as her two co-stars. The special
effects of the movie are quite
good. The underwater scenes
are spectacular, and the various
underwater creatures are all
pretty creepy. The effects are
not overpowering, allowing the
film to tell its story unfettered
(unlike the stupid dinosaur
movie, which was all about the
effects.)
This movie bills itself as
a suspense and it delivers the
goods. There are some genu¬

inely scary moments in this film
that will make you jump out
of your seat. Furthermore, the
story, save for a few plot holes,
is well held together and engag
ing for the viewer.
/ liked the story, but I felt
it was condensed in order to fit
into the two hour movie, and
the conclusion seemed a bit
rushed. Overall, it is an inter
esting, suspenseful film. I give
it two and 3/4 stars (out of five).
I thought this movie was
worth the price of the admis
sion and I am going to give it a
three out of five stars. Not ev
ery movie can be a great movie,
so the cinematic landscape has
to be dotted with movies that
are simply good entertainment.
If you are looking for a few
thrills and a good suspense
movie, then I recommend
Sphere to you.

A battler's testimony

Hamel Contributing Reporters

successful field hockey career.
Throughout high school I had
worked my way to All-State and
Ail-American titles. But a con
tinued career in the sport came
to a sudden halt when I devel
oped a fierce battle with an eat
ing disorder, a struggle which I
have endured for the past three
years. When most college stu
dents wake up in the morning,
their first thoughts are "What
will I wear?" or "What do I
have due in my first class?" Not
me. My first thoughts are "Will
I eat today? If so, how much or
how little? How many times
will I work out then, if I do
eat?" These are all questions I
struggle to answer, not just
when I wake up, but as I go
through my day, until I go to
sleep. And then, many of my
dreams are about food and ex-

Eating disorders. Many
people choose to believe that
they do not exist at Gettysburg
College. All someone has to do
is open their eyes to see that
there are students who are af
fected by bulimia and/or anor
exia. The fight against eating
disorders is a continuous one.
For those who are struggling to
overcome it, the battle is ex
hausting. Each day, the mere
thought of food overpowers a
person's thoughts and actions,
resulting in an obsession that
just doesn't stop.
The following is a per
sonal experience of a student
who has continuously battled
eating disorders over the past
three years. Hopefully this will
give a better understanding of
what it is like to live with an
eating disorder and help us to
realize that it is a common oc¬

currence in our society.
/ came to Gettysburg with
high hopes of a productive and

erase. Contrary to what many
people believe, eating disorders
are not just about being skinny.
My eating disorder is about my
need for control and perfection.

It is related to my desire to
please everyone. It is a reflec
tion of the guilt and worthless
ness that I feel about myself.
Sometimes, I do not believe that
I am worthy of eating.
Over the past three years
my weight has ranged from 90
pounds to 130 pounds. Finally,
this past fall, my weight reached
the lowest ever and I was forced
to go to an eating disorders hos
pital. My three week stay taught
me a lot about myself, both in
relation to food and self-worth
as a person. Although the hos
pital has helped me tremen
dously and I have now gained
about 25 pounds, every day is
a difficult struggle.
What is important is that
people are aware that eating
disorders are very prevalent,
especially on college campuses
like Gettysburg.

The first step to over
coming this battle is to admit
that you have a problem and to
accept help from those who care
the most for you. In doing this,
half the battle is won.

Contributing Reporter
Alex Rowland, a profes
sor of organic chemistry at
Gettysburg College, is a man
who spends his days working
with his students and doing re
search in the laboratories of the
Chemistry Department. He
has spent his last 40 years in
Gettysburg and is one of the
most senior faculty members in
the Chemistry Department.
Raised in New York,
Rowland is one of seven sib
lings. He spent five years in
high school, which he de
ribed
buiucu

as a:
a great
experi
ence.
"An ex-
tra year

did me a lot of good. I learned
typing, took extra courses and
did a lot of extracurricular ac
tivities," he commented.
He did his undergraduate
studies at Gettysburg College
because his parents wanted him
to study at a Lutheran college.
After graduating from
Gettysburg, he attended Brown
University, where he studied
organic chemistry. Ultimately,
he came back to Gettysburg as
a professor.
As a professor, Rowland
has flourished and is held in
high regard among both his
peers and his students, al
though he has the reputation of
giving difficult pop quizzes. He
was awarded the Distinguished
Teaching Award this year, and
has published articles in many
journals over the years.
Rowland thinks the

Honor Code System was the
best thing to be introduced into
college. He believes that it
makes students more reliable
and fosters a trustworthy rela
tionship between the faculty
and the students.
Over the years, he also
tried to promote a smoke-free
environment in the college.
Even so, he can still be found
smoking on the steps of
Briedenbaugh Hall. The latter
incident expresses the more
human side of Rowland.

In the research field.
Rowland is a prominent figure.
He has been carrying out re
search in both stereochemistry
and fullerenes and is a promi
nent member in that field.
"Because I like it," an
swered Rowland when asked
why he got involved in chem
istry. He has spent three-quar
ters of his life studying chemis
try only because he enjoys it.
"I was good in other subjects,
but chemistry was my favorite.
Curiosity drives me on."
He believes that science is
an important part of one's edu
cation and he was very dis
t u

i r b e d
when a
deci
sion
was
made
_-"
the labs

last year to remove
from some of the science
courses. "How can one do a
science course without con
ducting the practical side of it?"
he wondered.
Besides the resulting lack
of unity among the professors,
he is very satisfied with the
freedom Gettysburg allows its
professors. "Gettysburg never
interfered with my work. It al
lowed me to do research in
whatever interested me.
"I like working with my
students. They make it fun. I
want my students to do their
best and better than I ever did."
Since he is so involved in
his work, Rowland has very
limited outside interests.
"Working is my main pasttime,
but I find the history of World
War II very interesting." He
also sang in a choir during col
lege but quit because of all the
extra work.

At the end of the day,
Rowland likes to go home and
relax, which for him means
"drinking coffee and smoking
a cigar."
"The most important les
son I learned in life is that one
should exert oneself both out
wardly and inwardly." This is
Rowland's motto, and is per
haps what brought Rowland
the success and contentment he
now enjoys.

As one web page put it,
overpopulation is like a big
magnifying glass, it makes little
problems into big ones. Popu
lation size and global warming
are closely related. Also, all the
activities of deforestation, in
cluding clearance for stationary
agriculture, producing fire
wood and charcoal, rotating
cultivation, commercially
driven logging, expanding ur
ban and industrial areas, over
grazing and fodder collection,
are associated with the rapid
growth of population. Energy
consumption also increases

For 99% of man's history,
there was essentially no popu
lation growth. But now, in the
last 1% of our history (starting
at approximately year 0), hu
man population has exhibited
exponential growth. It took
35,000 years (to 1830) to reach
the first billion people. The
second billion took only 100
years (to 1930) to reach, and
the third, 30 years (by 1960).
The fourth was reached in 15
years (by 1975), and the fifth
only 12 years (by 1987). With
today's rate of growth, our
population will swell from 5.6
billion to about 8.5 billion by
2025. If current predictions of
population growth prove accu
rate and patterns or human ac
tivity on the planet remain
unchanged, science and tech
nology may not be able to pre
vent the irreversible degrada
tion of the environment or
widespread world poverty.

move into cities. Stress is also
put on land as it is pushed to
meet human needs.
The answer to these
problems may be a sound edu
cational program. Family plan
ning and social and economic
incentives may help curb this
population growth.
At any rate, what is done,
or not done, in the next decade
will determine the economic,
social, and political prospects
for much of the world for the
next century.

Monty worth the
show

by Stacy Schmeidel
Contributing Reviewer
Why would anyone
want to see a movie about six
unemployed guys who take
up stripping to make a few
bucks? Well, take it from some
one who's seen The Full
Monty, which was released
last August, not once but
seven times: this is one film
you won't want to miss. Sure,
the plot focuses on a cadre of
average blokes "getting their
kit off." But this is no

Showgirls. It's not even Strip
tease. The Full Monty, di
rected by Peter Cattaneo and
written by Simon Beaufoy, is
a simultaneously poignant, in
sightful, and laugh-'til-you
cry funny look at friendships,
self-esteem, and making the
most of what you've got. Lit
erate and witty, the film also
features one of the most real
istic and richly drawn mar
riages ever portrayed in a
comedy, and some of the most
brilliant physical comedy of
the past year.

Plus, it's got lawn
gnomes. What more could
you ask for?
The man behind the
Monty scheme is Gaz (Robert
Carlyle, virtually unrecogniz
able from the loathsome
Begbie he played in last year's
Trainspotting), who like a lot
of men in Sheffield, England,
is down on his luck after los
ing his job in the bust of
Sheffield's steel industry.
Desperate to'come up
with 700 quid to pay his over
due child support bills, Gaz
notices how the local women
line up when a traveling
Chippendales show comes to
town, and seizes on the no
tion of putting on a local ver
sion of the show in order to
make some quick cash.

Reactions to the scheme
are initially cool ("Who'd
want to see your widgie?")_,
but times in Sheffield are
tough, and almost before Gaz
knows it he's holding audi
tions and putting together a
line-up of dancers.
Over the next few

weeks, through a series of rous
ing rehearsals, soccer games,
and personal crises, the guys
coalesce, both as friends and as
a dancing ensemble; these six
men who initially had nothing
in common are soon sharing
beauty tips and swinging their
hips to Donna Summer tunes.
The problem, as some see
it, is that even after all the re
hearsal time, the ensemble is still
made up of average guys. Gaz
is "too thin," Dave is "too fat,"
Lomper's "pigeon chested," and
while Horse has some good
moves, he's also got gray hair
and a hip that's "a bit dodgy."
Pressed as to why the lo
cal "birds" will turn out to see
this act when they can see "the
real thing" at a Chippendale's
show, Gaz lights upon an idea
that will make his group stand
out. He promises that the
Sheffield men will go "the full
Monty," that is, they'll take their
striptease act all the way, no g
strine required.

As the film winds toward
its inevitable (yet tasteful!) con
clusion, we watch the six main
characters wrestle with the per
sonal insecurities that accom
pany unemployment, divorce,
body image, and intimacy.
Of particular note is Mark
Addy {Frost, in preproduction)
as Gaz' best friend Dave, who's
convinced that his weight is
cooling his wife's love for him
but feels unable to do anything
about it.
The other men in the
group are played by Tom
Wilkinson (The Ghost and the

Darkness), Steve Huison (When
Saturday Comes), Paul Barber
(Priest), and Hugo Speer (Bhaji
on the Beach).
The Full Monty has de
servedly earned Oscar nods for
Best Score, Screenplay, Director,
and Best Picture, and a Golden
Globe nomination for Best Pic
ture, but it's the fully drawn
characters that make the film
worth seeing even more than
once. After spending a couple of
hours with Gaz and the boys,
you'll want to see more of
them—even after they've gone
the full monty!

The Full Monty will be
shown in Bowen Auditorium on
Sunday and Monday at 8 p.m.

Women's history? Duh

by Sara Lindahl
Contributing Reporter

and the month of March has
been designated Women's
History Month to honor
many great women and to cel
ebrate their achievements.
During this month,
Gettysburg College's aca
demic buildings will be deco
rated with colorful posters to
featuring women who have
made outstanding contribu
tions to these academic fields.
The posters were de
signed not just to include trail
blazers who fought against
discrimination to force doors
open for women's higher edu
cation and promotions in the
work place, but also include
women whose efforts have
helped a global community.

Two years ago I overheard
a male to male conversation in
Musselman Library. The boys
were looking at the course cata
logue when one asked the other,
"Why is there a women's stud
ies major, but not a men's stud
ies major?" The response was,
"Duh, what do you think history
is?" The first replied, "Oh yeah,
that's because women haven't
done anything."
It is my hope that at the
end of next month, everyone on
this campus will be able to scoff
at this erroneous statement.
Women have made a sig
nificant contribution to history,

Women's history was
completely neglected in cur
riculums as recently as the
1970's.
In 1978, a California task
force started Women's History
Week, which led to Women's
History Month across the na
tion. In 1987, Congress de
clared March to be Women's
History Month.
Many states now have a
Women's Hall of Fame, and
Women's History Month has
become a focal point of cel
ebration across the nation.
I encourage everyone to
examine the posters and join in
the celebration of women's his
tory throughout the month of
March.

Screenwriter/Novelist to speak
in Junction

Screenwriter and novelist Todd Komarnicki will be reading from his work on Thursday,
February 26th, at 8:00 p.m. in the Junction. The event is sponsored by the Writing House.
Komarnicki's novels include Famine (1997) and Free (1995). Of Famine, Publisher's Weekly
says, "Hints of supernatural forces at work subtly underscore the narrative's theme: the
power of emotional need to create its own reality. A stylistic tour de force."



Library BULLETin

by Libby Musselman
Library Columnist
Q: I'm a big fan of In
terlibrary Loan, but I have a
complaint. If I want two ar
ticles from the same journal,
why can't I write them both
on the same request form?
It saves paper, and then
I don't have to write down my
name and address so many
times-what a pain!
A: We need one request
per card for two reasons. One
is that even though the articles
are from the same journal, the

same may
be filling the request for both
articles.
The second is that we
must comply with copyright
laws. After we've made five
requests in the same year (like
in 1998) tor the current five
years of one journal (like the
Journal of Chemical Educa
tion from 1992 to 1998), then
we (as in Gettysburg College)
must pay a copyright fee for
each subsequent request (af
ter five requests) of that jour
nal (dated from the past five
years).

It is bookkeeping that
drives us crazy and we know
it doesn't make you feel any
better, but we have to com
ply with the law. Capice?
Q: Who decides what
books and videos the library
buys? If a student like me

wants something, who (or is it
whom?) do I tell?
A: Librarians, and the fac
ulty select and purchase materi
als for our collection. Generally
the selections support the cur
riculum.
However, we are happy to
entertain suggestions from stu
dents as well. Please give us your

Conflict and ComEmus-

To the Editor:

In defense of a brotherhood

I am writing in response
to the column "Greek Prob
lems," printed in the Febru
ary 19, 1998 edition of The
Gettysburgian. I will refrain
from making scathing re
marks as I understand this
point of view. 1 will, however,
proceed to show that harsh
generalizations about Greek
life are, at least in one case,
sorely mistaken.
I must start by giving
some background so that one
can better understand where
my point of view is coming

from. Upon coming to Get
tysburg, I too was skeptical
about the values of Greek life.
I came over to Crow often
simply to visit my older
brother and many of his
friends whom I have known
for a number of years. At a
certain point in the second
semester of my freshman year,
I made the decision that I
would join Alpha Chi Rho,
and that has probably been
the most important decision
that I have made in my col
lege career.

The article points to the
shortcomings of fraternities
citing that fraternities are es
sentially nothing more than
drinking clubs. It further goes
on to cover its bases in decry
ing the most basic response
that "we do more than just
party," saying that one or two
philanthropic events a year
and participation in events
organized by other groups
does not really add toward to
good of the community or
campus. I am in complete
agreement on those grounds.
I would simply like to bring
to point out that the standard
view of fraternities, at least in
one case, is very far off base.
Yes, we at Alpha Chi
Rho do party. I won't try to
justify that in saying that we
are providing some great so
cial outlet for the campus, or
any other b.s. line commonly
recited. In regards to parties,
I will simply say that in most
u
_£,
a_;
I
tc
vi _oi
al
c j
a i
r_{
I

cases, they are simply a lot of
fun. I would like to turn the
attention, to the fact that we at
Alpha Chi Rho do, in fact,
more than just party. Since I
have been a brother in this fra
ternity I have seer, the most
dynamic and upward moving
organization I have ever been
a part of. Certainly, we have
our routine philanthropy
events each year, with our char
lty volleyball tournament
(which last spring raised almost
$1500 for a one day event) be
ing the most prominent. We

participate from time to time
in those events organized by
others; helping with toy drives,
spending time with underprivi
leged children and many other
worthwhile ventures. These,
however, are few and far be
tween. What I would most like
to draw attention to is the fact
that this fraternity organizes
and runs one of the biggest
ongoing philanthropy projects
on campus. Every Saturday
(and recently we have begun
going on Friday afternoons as
well) my Brothers and I travel
the 50-or-so miles to

Sandtown, a community in in
ner city Baltimore. Every week,
we spend numerous hours
working on the renovation of
a row house located at 1506
Mount Street, working in con
junction with Habitat for Hu
manity. This is not simply a
chapter project, either. Al
though still struggling some,
our initiative has started a na
tionwide project for all broth
ers of Alpha Chi Rho, combin
ing fundraising efforts with in
dividual participation in order
to help rebuild this once-thnv
mg community. In addition to
just working, we have at
tempted to join ourselves into
the community, making friends
with local youths (especially a
young boy named Marcus) and
spending almost as much time
with them as with our work on
the physical structure of the
house. The generalization
about fraternities being noth¬

ing more than a negative influ
ence and a drinking club are
not at all true. (We often find
ourselves having a much better
time in Sandtown than we do
at a party.)
Now I would like to ad
dress the generalization that
"Greek society is not composed
of individuals as much as herds"
and that "people who used to
think on their own now resign
themselves to accepting the
views of the group." My re
sponse to these statements is
simply that in the experiences
I have had, this couldn't be fur
ther from the truth. Some of
my best friends in the entire
world are here at AXP, and
these are the people that are
polar opposites to my view
point. We never agree on any¬

thing, debate and argue con
stantly, and I love them dearly
for it. On more than one oc
casion, I've found myself
locked in struggles over the
existence of God or the nu
ances of Buddhism, as well as
discussions of every topic from
chemistry to rush. Through it
all, rather than conforming to
any particular viewpoint, I've
found myself strengthened in
my own convictions, and have
been encouraged to do so. Be
ing a member of Alpha Chi Rho
has allowed me to pursue a per
sonal passion for philanthropic
endeavors and shown me the
value of many points of view
that I had previously dismissed,
while all the while allowing me
to cling to my own individual
views and beliefs.

I hope that these ex
amples have opened eyes to the
fact that, whether we here at
AXP are an exception or not,
generalizations about Greek
life do not always hold true.
Thank you very much for tak
ing the time to read my re
sponse.
Sincerely,
Ryan Ridenour

Consider this

On Monday, Tuesday ,
and Wednesday of this week,
students were presented with
the opportunity to help deter
mine the future of student life
on this campus.
Elections for the Student
Senate executive board were
held in the CUB from 11 to 1.
But due to the fact that none of
the three candidates received
more than fifty percent of the
votes, a special election will be
held next week to determine
the office of Student Senate
President.
In the past three days,
only about 400 out of over
2,000 eligible student voters
turned out to support their
choices for the leadership posi
tions. That means only one
fifth of the student population
opted to participate in the se
lection of these powerful.
Who really cares about
apathy anyway? How does
apathy affect me? Does apathy
even matter? Perhaps the issue
of student apathy has been
beaten to death.
Some students might
question the effectiveness of
our student government. This,
however, should not be a rea
son not to vote, but rather, the
primary reason to cast a ballot.
The run-off election held
for the presidency should be
looked upon as a second chance
for the campus, a chance to

show that we care about the fu
ture of social and academic life
at this college.
Students constantly
whine for more social events,
for non-Greek activities, and
for more culture. Well, what
does the Senate do? Does any
body care? By the voter turn
out, guess not.
The elections were widely
advertised. The everyone di
gest has been flooded with
"vote for me" messages for sev
eral days now; bulletin boards,
walls, and doors around cam
pus are flapping with signs.
Could it have been the glut of
political advertisements actu
ally discouraged students from
voting? Was it due to the fact
that people don't happen to be
in the CUB between the hours
of Hand 1?
These are all possible ex
planations for the lack of stu
dent support for the election,
but they are not excuses. Does
this imply that over 1600 of the
students on this campus could
not find time in their days to
go to the CUB and circle four
names on a piece of paper?
How many of these non-voters
can be heard complaining about
something on this campus?
Perhaps it is time for ac
tion. Perhaps if they ignore
them, the problems will go
away. Yeah....and perhaps tu
ition will go down next year.

Conflict and Coh$eh$us
To the Editor: TotheEditor:

Sisters unite
"Our strength is in know
ing that each one of us could
stand alone, but we choose to
stand together."
On behalf of the Greek
women at Gettysburg, we
wanted to write a letter ex
pressing the benefits of soror
ity life. We are proud of our
affiliation and more than will
ing to tell everyone why we feel
this way.
Not only are sorority
women leaders in our GreeK
organizations, but we hold
many executive offices
throughout other organizations
as well. We are all active par¬

ticipants in shaping the lives of
students at Gettysburg College.
In addition to that, we support
many campus functions both in
numbers and with monetary
contributions. As a community
of Greek women, we agreed
not to sponsor any events that
conflicted with the Snowball
and encouraged our members
to attend. The Panhellenic
Council (which is the unifying
and governing body of all five
sororities on campus) gave
$500 to help support the all
campus event. The 400 plus
women that are part of the
Greek system bring a tremen
dous amount to Gettysburg.

Sororities are social orga
nizations, but we are also much
more. Academic success is held
at a high value. Women can
not rush if they have below a
2.2 GPA. Many organizations
have even higher standards
once you become a sister. Phi
lanthropy is also a valued en
tity. Whether the event is An
chor Splash (Delta Gamma),
Turkey Trot (Chi Omega), a
Softball Tournament (Gamma
Phi Beta), a Dance-a-thon (Al
pha Delta Pi), or a Pancake
Breakfast (Alpha Xi Delta),
women of ALL organizations
work together to raise con
sciousness and financial sup
port for those less fortunate
than we are here at Gettysburg.
We are, however, differ¬

ent from other campus organi
zations. What makes us unique
is our ritual. Every Tuesday
night, we reaffirm the fraternal
values that we were all founded
on. They are the basis and
guidelines for every meeting.
Every sorority and even the
Panheilenic Council has an
open creed that states each
group's purpose and values.
Some creeds are repeated as
part of ritual, while others are
recognized in different ways.
The sorority pins we all wear

each Tuesday are a symbol of
our affiliation and the design
is an extension of our ritual.
Pins are meant to be a daily re
minder of our foundation.
Being Greek has made us
all more self-confident. We are
not afraid to voice our opinions
in a room of 85 people. The
results include teamwork, com
promise, and respect for oth
ers. Running meetings with all
these women has challenged
our leadership skills to a higher
level than

we thought possible. We
value our differences and sup
port each of our sisters not only
within our organization but the
others as well. We collectively
agree that joining a sorority was
one of the best individual deci
sions we have made in college.
We can only hope that our
pride in being Greek will ex
emplify the reasons why we
decided to make the commit
ment to Greek Life, not only
during college, but also for a
lifetime. In Sisterhood and

Greeks and independents, equal impact

As a member of a slave
producing, cattle herd forming,
alcoholic inducing, party cen
tralized organization, I obvi
ously would be completely in
clined to agree with the article
entitled "Greek Problems."
Our mind numbing, commu
nistic policies and beer guzzling
impulses have left us stupid and
without independence or indi
viduality. Furthermore, it is
downright unfortunate and
completely horrendous that
organizations like the Greek
system exist. This campus and
the world in general would be
much better off without
Greeks.
Is this really what is be
ing said about over half the
people of our campus? It sure
seems like it. Anyway, let's
examinet arguments.

First, is the argument that
Greek organizations subtract
from participation and mem
bership in other clubs and ex
tracurricular activities. Yes,
pledging does take up a great
deal of time, but the first thing
that one often fails to under
stand is that joining a Greek
organization is a life long com
mitment which effects where
you will be living, who you will
be living with, and in general,
the people who will become
your closest friends for the next
few years. Oh I'm sorry, I for
got, we brainwash our pledges

so that they have absolutely no
free will and no ability to
choose who they associate with
or what activities they choose
to do for the rest of their col
lege career. Come on, please
tell me that e some research
actually went into this. Real
ize that many of us choose to
be Greeks for the same reasons
any other person joins a politi
cal party or a different social
organization. Each of us feels
strongly about the ideals of the
chapter, and we enjoy the com
pany of the people within it.
How horrible is this?

I, and about 50% of this
campus, chose to become
Greeks, and we each deal with

the consequences of that
choice. The article praises those
who rebel against the status
quo? Which would be the
more productive choice? Is it
better to quit a system that you
willingly became a member of
and do nothing but complain
about its existence, or is it bet
ter to remain in the system and
work on improving upon its
faults? Of course I have my
problems with being Greek, I
doubt you can find one Greek
who feels the system is with
out flaw. Some of us though
work to improve upon it in
stead of quitting.
The article holds us (the
Greeks) responsible for the
same standards as other clubs
and states that we can't take
credit for any participation in
any activity we did not orga
nize. Hence, if you take away

everything that a fraternity or
sorority does or is involved in,
all that we have left is drinking
and partying. Think about the
intelligence of that last state
ment. It is analogous to the
statement that if I take away the
skin, muscle and bone from a
human body, all I have left is
the fluids within it and I refer
to this as "human." If you are
going to judge the Greek sys
tem, judge us on everything we
do, not simply that which you
consider in poor taste. Just
because you have seen Animal
House and PCU does not mean
you can judge the Gettysburg

Greek system by those stan
dards. Second, the herd atmo
sphere which the column
claims affects the Greeks so
soon after rush is over is obvi
ously true. You will not get me
to he and say that Greeks don't
travel in packs. Okay now tell
me what's wrong with this?
J ust because I choose to go to
Servo with a group of friends,
or go to the bar with my broth
ers does not mean that some
where along the line I, or any
of them have lost the capacity
for free thought. You see
though, the point of joining an
organization like a fraternity is

to understand the concepts of
cooperation and sacrifice. Each
of us functions for the good of
the whole, but do so without a
loss of morality or belief. To
make a hasty and sweeping
generalization that the herd at
titude robs one of self is com
pletely groundless. It isn't only
the voices of the independents
which "make the difference."
I was raised to believe that any
one can make a difference as
long as they keep an open mind
and give 110% to whatever

their cause might be. The ar
ticle states that the Greeks are
a negative influence. I feel they
are a necessary and useful so
cial outlet and provide a fam
ily environment to those who
choose to open their eyes and
minds to the possibilities for
personal growth. As an indi
vidual, Greek, stubborn, and
hardheaded human being I can
make just as much of a differ
ence as someone with all these
wonderful characteristics, yet is
not Greek.

In closing, please realize
the absurdity of both of our
articles because neither one is
going to make one iota of dif
ference in the lives of our read
ers. You see, maybe half of the
campus community will read
both of the pieces. Maybe a
portion of the faculty and ad
ministration will likewise pick
up a copy. And maybe a few
parents will even take some of
their time to page through, but
what I have said before and will
reiterate is simply act rather
than speak. Words and articles
are a waste of our time. For
example I have just spent the
past hour writing this rebuttal
when I could have been doing
something else which could
have affected me positively. To
change the status quo requires
demonstrable action, not ink
on a page. The pen is not
mightier than the sword and in
reality is perhaps only equal to

it. Respectfully submitted,
With hope for the future,
Joshua D. Hirsch


To the 'burg or not to the 'burg

Conflict and Comensu

by Christina Dickert
Columnist A few days ago, I was re
minded of a conversation I had
when I was home over break.
A senior from my high school
asked me how I had come to
choose Gettysburg as the place
I wanted to be for the four most
important years of my educa
tion. I was speechless. I really
never looked back to my col
lege application process, which
started about two years ago.
(Two years ago!! Geez, I'm
feeling really old.) Sorry to say
but I gave some corny answer
like, "It just grabbed me as the
place I wanted to go." That
was an absolute lie, and it both
ered me for the rest of the day.
Finally, as I laid in bed that
night trying to fight my guilty
conscience, I racked my brains
for the real answer to that ques
tion. I am so embarrassed to

admit this, but the reason why
I had chosen Gettysburg as one
of my top ten choices the spring
of my junior year was because
I really liked the pictures in the
brochure. C'mon, you know
they are nice- fall in central
Pennsylvania, a group of
friends (culturally diverse, of
course) sitting on the steps of
Musselman Library. This, for a
sixteen year old, is appealing.
Hey, it also had a political sci
ence department. I thought
that might come in handy, since
I believed that is what I wanted
my major to be.
So, in the fall, when the
Gettysburg representative came
to visit my quaint Catholic high
school, I was one of two people
interested in coming to Gettys
burg. Or at least 1 thought I
was interested. The meeting
was during seventh period,
which just happened to be the
exact same time that I had

physics. I learned a bit more
about Gettysburg, was per
suaded to come visit the cam
pus, and went to my AP English
class ten minutes late. It was a
good deal.
My interview and visit
were a complete disaster. I
wore black Adidas sneakers to
the Admissions office. My
mom could have killed me, but
Gettysburg was my fourth
choice. American University is
where I belonged- big city, no
cows, famous lawmakers, and,
the best part, five hours away
from home. I really didn't care
if I was accepted here. The tour
was even worse. I had picked
Reading Days for the perfect
weekend to visit. Even more,
it was a Saturday morning. The
campus was completely and
totally empty. Our tour guide
was at least seven feet tall, and,
considering that my mother
and I are five feet tall, we felt

like we were running a mara
thon. Let's just say that Get
tysburg did not make the im
pression on me that I was hop
ing to get.
Things didn't turn out the
way I had planned. I was ac
cepted at American, too, but
Gettysburg offered me more
financial aid. I tried getting
excited about coming here, but
I felt so cheated. Just because
money controlled where I
wanted to go, I was stuck liv
ing in this godforsaken farm
land for the next four years. I
used the same line, over and
over again to my mother, when
1 was trying to convince her to
let me transfer to Lehigh
(which is strategically placed in
my hometown) this fall when I
was homesick. I never wanted
to come here, I'd say. I felt as
though I had made no big de
cision- the financial aid had
made the choice for me.

Almost four months after
that homesick period, I find
myself running into a campus
tour every Monday and
Wednesday as I walk out of
work. As I leave the White
House, I see the perspective
first-year student with his or
her parents, walking with one
of our own peers. Walking
across the grass, I feel their cu
rious eyes follow me across the
empty campus, imagining
where I am going and what
exciting class I am heading for.
I feel like walking up to them
and telling them the answer
that I couldn't give that senior
over break. I want to tell them
that no matter where you end
up in the fall, whether it is your
first choice or your absolute last
choice, you'll end up loving it,
and, like me, who is not look
ing forward to going home
over Spring Break, you will
never want to leave it.



Wagging the dog?

by Camtnie Grant
Columnist The national media has
implied to its readers that
Desert Thunder, may be an
other Wag the Dog situation.
A couple of months ago, Wag
the Dog was released in the
aters. It is a film about a scan
dal that involves the President
covering up a sexual affair by
conspiring a war to distract the
'
President's alleged affair.
Granted Clinton has re
cently been accused of an al
leged affair with Monica
Lewinsky, but is that a reason
to move troops into the Middle
East to distract attention from
his personal life to a potential
war? Clinton is only human
and has made his fair share of

mistakes. However, putting
thousands of lives at risk and
spending endless dollars only to
help himself seems outrageous
especially when the facts re
veal that Clinton is by no A
means a war hero and §?
neither are his __Q;

for the best advice, not
how he can distract at

Obviously there are serious
conditions that have evolved in
the Middle East, and it was es
sential that the United States
intervene. Favorably, Saddam
Hussein has agreed to allow

,
_Mh " United Nations inspectors _'' into ' _' M
Iraq. President Clinton and
Saddam Hussein have agreed to
let United Nations inspectors

State Madeleine Albright.
I do wish the press would
back off and stop trying to pro
pose that the Clinton scandal

is similar to Wag the Dog. I
also find it incredibly disturb
ing that according to U.S. News
and World Report, a copy of
the movie was played on Iraqi
television last week along with
clips of Albright, Cohen, and
Berger being shouted off stage
in Ohio. This just shows that
Saddam is feeding off the press
and problems in America to
make himself look better and
the United States look like one
big conspiracy. Saddam
Hussein's eyes and ears are
open to anything that can help
him and his country gain re
venge over the United States.
President Clinton, keep
your chin up. To the citizens
of America, pray for Saddam
Hussein's cooperation with the
United Nations inspectors so
that we will not have to face
war again in the Middle East.

The Greek Word

by Earl Redding and Erin
Patterson
Public Relations Chairs IFC and
Panhel The Greek Word is an
article that appears almost ev
ery issue of The Gettysburgian
in which the happenings of the
Greek campus community can
be communicated to the rest of
campus. This semester the posi
tives of the Greek community
have greatly outweighed the
negatives. Greeks have been
very active in student body de
cisions such as Student Senate,
SAC, Social Life Committee,
$50,000 Spend the Money ad
hoc committee, as well as
sports and many other differ
ent clubs and committees on
campus. Greeks have been very
prevalent here at Gettysburg

not because they belong to a
certain fraternity or sorority,
but because they choose to par
ticipate in clubs,
sp r s > etc> for _^_aSk
them- 1** iffflff

selves.
Wear

life, it
is a
choice to be
part of
an or
ganiza-t
1 o n
that
bases itself
on its

ritual. The ritual distinguishes
fraternities and sororities from
other _organizations

shown in their philanthropy.
This past week Alpha
Delta Pi and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon held their first

on campus. A fraternity and
sorority ritual is prevalently

annual Mardi Gras
_^_. dance-a-thon in
_gS which over $1200
T was collected for their
T philanthropy, the

House. Many other
sororities and fraterni
ties have also been in
volved in their philan
thropies such as Alpha
Chi Rho's Habitat for

Alpha Delta Pi and Sigma
Alpha Epsilon's dance party
was a great success and loads
of fun. Tina Salaby was the
individual winner who was on
the dance floor until 4:30 a.m.
Jenny Baumgardner and Mike
Graham were the winners of
the Mardi Gras Madness Dance

Method Invocation"
Remote method invocation (RMI)
provides a framework for developing
distributed object systems using Java.
Using RMI, it is possible to create
Java objects whose methods can be
invoked by objects residing on
different hosts. Object serialization,
introduced in the 1.1 release of the
JDK, provides a means by which
objects can be converted to and from
a stream of bytes. Serialization makes
it possible for applications to send
full objects across a network. This
feature is utilized by RMI to provide
support for passing full objects as
parameters or return values. This talk
introduces Java RMI. It begins with
an _overview of RMI and is followed
by a simple example. Additional
examples illustrate how objects can
be passed between programs running
on different hosts.

Cupid had his turn, now bring on. St. Patrick

by Steve Jenkins
Sports Editor
So your Valentine's Day
did not pan out. Your girl
bought you all kinds of lovey
dovey crap like candy and
chocolate. All you wanted
was a big fat bowl of chicken
wings, an ice cold beer, and
the remote to the television.
Well, guess what? St. Patty's
Day is here; so if V-day was a
wash out, the next major holi
day is almost here and it is all
about guys.
Yeah, no more stupid
cherubs shooting people with
arrows. Just plain fun. Just
settle into your lazy boy, with
all of your buddies and just,
you know, consume, It's
probably the best holiday of
the year, and to add to it, the
Phillies Spring training camp
will be opening so we can see
all the nobodies and the

never-will-be's that reside on the
"Spring Training" invite list.
What was on TV on
Valentine's Day? The NBA.
Great, yet another weekend of
games where everyone in the
league is trying to defeat ot "he
like Mike." Oh, you know what,

The only thing we want on
Valentine's Day is for it to end.
We see our hard earned cash

but yell at Ricky Watters
as he prances into the end

zone. That is the one. "If lov
ing Ricky is wrong... I don't
want to be right," as my friends
would say.
Your girl gave you some

chocolate, maybe a shirt, and
then prances you all over town

for _^_Bj
dinner while you could be *
doing something cool--like
watching bowling. Hey, any
thing is better than a dinner
where you actually have to
wipe your mouth and concen
trate on using real silverware.

Man, the nerve of women. We
get involved with them, while
all along they know all we love

is football and food, and then
they try to domesticate us. No
way.

On the other

One day out of the year
we must shed our
meat-headedness in

Yeah right. We are men.
We are meat. We are proud.

ended 17-8. She has been play
ing basketball since she was in
the second grade and also
played soccer and softball in
high school.
The thing that is so spe
cial about Karyn is that she has
been on the basketball team
here at Gettysburg for four
years, but she has not gotten a
significant amount of playing
time in any particular season.
Even so, she is still one of the
hardest workers on the team.
This is a characteristic
that many strive for, but few
attain. What keeps her going

PETE &JANEL
continued from page 23 -

that goals can be accomplished if
people dedicate themselves to at
taining them.
The men's team achieved
so much this year because they
were dedicated to accomplish
ing their goals. Reflecting on
the season and his four years
at Gettysburg, Pete said, "I'd
like to thank the guys swim
team and Coach Rawleigh for
staying so dedicated this year,
but most of all I'd like to thank
Todd, Greg and Chris for the
best four years of my life in and
out of the pool.
"Both Janel Pfeifer and
Pete Casares have gained an
immeasurable amount from

game of basketball also keeps
her around. The true test of
her dedication occurred during
a practice over Christmas
break. While running sprints
during practice, Karyn felt
pains in her chest. She knew it
had to be serious because she
was already in condition,
thanks to Coach Kirkpatrick's
rigorous preseason and season
practices.
Albanesius did not want
to take any chances, so she got
examined by a doctor. It was,
in fact, a heart murmur. Luck
ily for Karyn, the doctor said
it was not life-threatening and
she would be able to continue
playing basketball. She came
back and did not miss a step.
Karyn passed this test with fly
ing colors.

The last home game for
Karyn and the rest of the se
niors, on Saturday Feb. 21, was
full of excitement. It was a big
game against Franklin &
Marshall. "I wanted everyone
to do well since it was an im
portant game," said Karyn.
They did, so did she. Karyn
started the game, scored the
first bucket, and played as
though she had been starting

their experiences on
Gettysburg's swim team. They
have both learned important
life lessons and made lifelong
friendships. For four years Pete
and Janel have dedicated them
selves to a strong swim pro
gram and they have each set
and accomplished many goals.
In closing Coach
Rawleigh commented, "Both
Pete and Janel have been very
accomplished in their sport and
they both have really contrib
uted to the success of the pro
gram." The great success and
lessons learned at Gettysburg
will help both Janel and Pete
to be happy, successful people.

all season. She says, "It was
niceto play well in front of my
family. I was so excited. It
was fun."
Not many student-ath
letes have the dedication to
stick with a sport when they
are not getting much playing
time, but the athletes that do
stay with it ought to be com
mended. So if you see Karyn
around campus before she
graduates this May, thank her
for all the effort she put forth
to make the Lady Bullets a bet
ter haskethall team.

The Winter Olympics
have come to an end, not that
anyone was paying attention.
CBS Sports had made a bad
situation worse with poor time
edits and awful commentary.
One can understand the
fourteen hour tape delay, how
ever when CBS decides to
broadcast the U.S. women's
hockey final and cuts and
pastes the game to fit an allot
ted time slot, the word shame
ful comes to mind.
The Olympics had some
"highs" though, just ask any
Canadian snowboarder.

Freshman, Amos Spencer, has
gone 40'2" in that event as well
as 20'2 1/4 in the long jump.
Freshman teammate, Bri,an Bit

"Picabo" we saw you, and even
after having knee surgery three
months before, three hun
dredths of a second were just
enough to capture the gold.
The Czech Republic
showed that they were the
golden with key victories over
Canada and Russia, while the
US brought a new meaning to
room service.
The biggest upset of the
Olympics was the defeat, by
concession, of Team Canada by
the Swiss in curling, which was
on live—thank God, 1 was get

Women's figure skating
was highlighted by the US tak
ing the gold and silver and

a 38*1" triple and 20' long

the last four Centennial cham
pionships, is the heavy favor

Lipinski had the "Kwan."
Overall, the Olympics
were watched because the
NHL was on hiatus, and well,
there had to be something else.
Maybe the next Olympics will
be more interesting, not that
listening to every tragedy an
athlete went through to get to
the Olympics wasn't intrigu
ing. The one advantage that
the Japanese had was the
effeciency with which the
Olympics was run—it was no

O' Captains, Our Captians...

Pete Casares and Janel Pfeifer led their respective swim teams to yet another Conference Title

By Chesha Miller
Player Profiler
Seventeen years ago,
when they were both five years
old, seniors Pete Casares and
Janel Pfeifer began their swim
ming careers. The pair, who
were to become future Gettys
burg College swim team cap
tains, started racing during
their summers for country club
swim teams.
When Janel was eight,
she began competing all year
round, while Pete waited until
the " seventh grade for year
round competitions. Pfeifer
and Casares have both left their
mark in Gettysburg's pool.
Pfeifer is an extremely

well versed swimmer. "Janel is
probably the most versatile ath
lete we've ever had," explained
Gettysburg head swim coach
Mike Rawleigh. "She's tough
and a very good competitor
who is willing to swim any
event that will help the team."
Janel has had the oppor
tunity to do just that, swim
ming the 200 yard , 500 yard
and 1000 yard freestyle, 200
yard butterfly, 200 yard back
stroke and the 400 yard Indi
vidual Medley. Pfeifer, who is
considered a distance swimmer,
has also competed in the long
est swimming race, the 1650
yard freestyle, which swimmers
fondly dub the "mile".

As a junior, she finished
third in the Centennial Confer
ence Championships in the
mile. During the Centennial
Conference Championship
meet her first year, Janel was
the bronze medalist in the 500
yard freestyle and was Centen
nial Conference runner-up in
thebackstrokc.
Janel's favorite event and the
even in which she has achieved die
greatest success is the back
stroke. "1 love the backstroke,"
explained Janel, "because it was
something 1 was always good
at." One of Pfeifer's fondest
swimming memories is when
she won the 100 yard back
stroke at the District meet dur
ing high school.
In her first swim race,
seventeen years ago, Pfeifer

swam the butterfly. Poignantly,
this past weekend at the Cen
tennial Conference Champion
ships Janel finished her swim
ming career with the butterfly.
"It was a really good way to end
[my swimming career]- doing
what got me into swimming,"
Pfeifer com- i

mented. Janel's
parents, Rory
and Josephine,
were very
touched by this
sentimental closure.
Through
out her swim
ming career
Janel has been
greatly sup
ported by her
parents and her
P o p - P o p
George. Her
father has
never missed a
race and her
grandfather even scheduled
surgery around
Janel's swim
season.

Having
her parents
with her
through all her
ups and downs
has forged a
very close rela
tionship be
tween the
three. "One of
the most im
portant things

Pholo courlesy ol PeleCasares
Pete Casares stands atop the podium claiming a medal for
Gettysburg College.

swimming has
done for me is
it made
mat u maue me

r rn
ciose to

gee my
parents," Janel said.
Pfeifer has learned a lot
from swimming. It has been
the backbone of her life and has
taught her about all the ups and
downs life has to offer. Swim
ming has also given Pfeifer hei
own identity and made her a ie
sponsible and dedicated person.
Janel realizes that success
will only come to her it she puts
the 110% success requires into
everything she does. Janel loves
swimming for Gett\sbuig's" s
close-knit team. "Wc_^'Mo
close because we want to k\
not because we have to be"

Pfeifer explained of
Gettysburg ^"s men~"s and
women's team.
"Both the girl's and guy's
teams are so close to each other
in and out of the pool. We have
been through all the good and
bad times together and every¬

one helps each other out."
In addition to being cap
tain of Gettysburg's swim team,
Janel is very involved with her
sorority, Gamma Phi Beta. She
is a management major and
economics minor. Looking to
wards the future Janel wishes
to be "a happv successful per
son." Senioi Pete Casares has
been !upp\ and successful in
his accomplishments. Casares,
who is a >.piintei and middle
distance swim hum, h.is had a
\i'i\ muwnsIuI swimming _c\-
im .it Gem shut;. He holds
ihuvot Gem shut _u'_mik1i\ idual

school records, in the 200 yard
IM (1:58.42), 100 yard butter
fly (50.97) and the 200 yard
butterfly (1:54.07).
In addition, he is a mem
ber of all hve of Gettysburg's
record holding relay teams, the
200 yard , 400 yard and 80

yard freestyle
relays as
well as
the 200
yard and
400 yard
medley relays.
Through
out his
career Pete has
also held
various Centen
nial Con
fer e n c e
records.
The.
past
week
end, at
the Cen
t e n n l a 1
Con fer-

e n c e
Champi
onships,
Pete qualified for his
third Na
11 o n a 1
Swim
m i n g
Champi
onships.
Over

spring break Pete will travel to
St. Louis to compete in the 100
yard and 200 yard butterfly, as
well as the 200 yard and 400
yard freestyle lelays.
Pete is ecstatic to have
some company at Nationals
this season. In fact, this season
he told Ins teammates he wasn't
going to Nationals without
them. Fortunately, Pete will be
at Nationals and he will have
sonic company with his friends
and fellow relay partners, Todd
Peters, Rich Carroll and Dave
_Lavigne. At Nationals the re
lay ream will have the oppor
tunity to compete in the 200

yard, 400 yard and 800 yard
freestyle relays.
"I am really excited to be
going with them, it was a team
goal," Casares explained about
the excitement of the team
qualifying for Nationals.
"We broke the 400 yard
freestyle record by 3.0 seconds
[at Centennials] and we knew
we were all going to make it.
It is the best memory." Casares
hopes to return from St. Louis
an All-Amencan in his indi
vidual events and along with
his relay team.
Pete has achieved his suc
cesses from his extreme dedi
cation and consistent hard
work during his four years at
Gettysburg. He understands
that if you work hard at some
thing, good things will come of
it. "You have to work to be suc
cessful," Pete explained.

Successful is just what
Casares is. According to Coach
Rawleigh Pete has improved
greatly over his four years be
cause he has tried to do every
thing right. "Pete is a real stu
dent of the sport- he under
stands swimming technique
very well," Rawleigh com
mented. "He really zeroes in
and is able to concentrate on
his strokes and turns.
"There is no wasted ef
fort in his swimming." Casares
is very focused on his swim
ming and likes to be thought

of as someone who is dedi
cated, hardworking and moti
vated. Swimming has been in
valuable to Pete Casares. It has
taught him dedication, disci
pline and how to set and
achieve goals, but most impor
tantly Pete has gained true
friendships through swimming.
"The senior class on the swim
team is really close," explained
Casares. "We've lived together
since sophomore year and they
are the best friends I could ever
ask for."

Pete is especially proud of
the success of the swim team
this season. He is a firm believer

Predicting the future

Commission reveals findings

by Rebecca Babbitt
Staff Reporter The Commission on the Future of Gettysburg College
met Saturday afternoon to present the preliminary findings of
their year-long examination of the College's academic and co
curricular programs. The final presentation will be made on
Monday and reviewed by the Board of Trustees at their next
two meetings in May and September.
The Commission, a group of 367 alumni, parents and
friends of the college, volunteered one year ago to examine
and plan for the future of the College. They formed nine task
forces to study:
Culture and the Arts
Collaborative Learning and Teamwork
Economics and Management
Enhancing Residential Life
Excellence in the Sciences and Psychology
Information Technology
Public Affairs and Public Service
Student Recruitment and Retention
Supporting Student Success
Together they proposed 186 recommendations plus sub
- points to be considered by the Board of Trustees.
*_L The major themes of the recommendations were presented
over the weekend. These themes included active teaching and
learning, creating a vibrant campus climate, working on global
I outreach, recruiting a diverse community, creating distinctive
programs, and improving technology and facilities. More pre
cise goals were presented in a formal report issued on Monday.
I President of the College, Gordon Haaland said the Com
mission presented "a truly impressive effort." Paul Odell,
I Chairman of the Board of Trustees told the 170 assembled
I members of the Commission "you've done a first class job."
I "I had high expectations, but they exceeded them," said
B President of the Commission, Jim Brenemann. "This will have
I a greater impact than anything else I've been involved in with
the College."

Redding wins presidency

Zalewski
by Laura Root
Staff Reporter After two different elec
tions, it has been decided that
Earl Redding will be the Student
Senate president for the 1998
1999 school year.
Last Monday, a runoff
election for the presidency was
held between Redding and Sara
Zalewski.
According to the Student
Senate Constitution, a person
running for an executive office
must capture fifty percent of all
student votes.
None of the three candi
dates for the position, John
Dunlap, Earl Redding, nor Sara
Zalewski could do so. A runoff
election was then held between
the top two vote-getters,
Redding and Zalewski.

Although there has not
been a runoff election in several
years, both Redding and
Zalewski thought that there

defeated in special ru
might be one this year.
"Having three candidates
for president splits the votes,"
said Redding.
Zalewski commented that,
"This year's Vice President, Val
Katzmar, who is in charge of
elections made sure that every
thing followed the Senate Con
stitution."
During the extra days of
campaigning that the candidates
received, both Redding and
Zalewski kept working hard to
_increase the amount of enthusi
asm on campus for elections.
Zalewski replaced signs,
wrote messages on the sidewalks,
and emailed to publicize the
event. Redding spoke up about
the elections and encouraged as
many people as he could to par
ticipate.
The candidates were not
happy with this extra election.
Zalewski thinks that it placed too
much pressure on both candi-

noff election
dates. "It's just four more days
of stress," she said.
One of Redding's goals
while in office is to reform the
Senate constitution. He hopes
to change the election process
and get nd of the runoff policy.
"Congratulations to all
other executive position holders
and thanks to everyone who sup
ported me. We have some big
shoes to fill," he concluded.
Redding replaces sitting
president Abby Rodgers who
graduates this spring.

"The Only Woman in the
Room" is a personal and vivid
account of Gordon's life in
Europe, prewar Japan, and the

United States. As the daughter
of a renowned Russian pianist
Leo Sirota, Beate Gordon grew
up in the cosmopolitan world
of the concert tour, and settled
in Japan in the 1930's.
During World War II, her
parents remained in Tokyo,
while Gordon lived in the
United States, attending Mills
College and monitoring Tokyo
Radio in five languages for the
government.
Gordon later returned to
Tokyo to work in General
MacArthur's headquarters,
where she singledhandedly for
mulated the clause guarantee
ing equal rights for women in
Japan's new constitution.
On returning to the
United States in 1947, Gordon

responsible for bringing artists,
writers, musicians, and dancers
from all over Asia to the United
States. In recognition of her
cross-cultural achievement, she

Other themes suggested imple
menting experiential learning,
increasing alumni involvement,
and accommodating the grow
ing residential needs of the Col
lege by constructing a new resi
dential facility.
"We will respond to ev
ery recommendation," said
Odell. "But we cannot imple
ment every idea."
"This is a work in
progress," Odell said. "This is
just another stage, it doesn't
end here," said Brenemann.
The theme of the Com
mission now is, "There can be
no bystanders in the future of

Future
Gettysburg College." The Col
lege hopes the Commission
will continue to play an active
role in their strategic Planning
and that others will volunteer.
Strategic Planning was pro
posed by Haaland in 1995 to
chart a course for the College's
future. The Commission and
its recommendations are part
of that plan.
"The commission mem
bers have provided thoughtful
and insightful perspectives on
areas of vital importance to the
future of the College, and their
recommendations will provide
significant impetus to the
Board of Trustees as

- continued _jmmjionl page -
Gettysburg College moves for
ward in its strategic planning
process," said Brenemann
But Haaland acknowl
edged that the recommenda
tions neglected History, Writing
and Civil War Studies.
The Commission also did
not look specifically at many of
the issues currently plaguing the
College. Although there has
been some student protest
about the tenure process, and
the College was sued for dis
crimination in tenure last se
mester, the Commission did not
deal with tenure as a separate
issue. They examined the "im
portant roles for faculty in ad¬
i — - _j -------

vising and collaborative learn
ing," said Brenneman and
looked for ways to recognize
and reward professors.
The issue of Greek Life
and the presence of Sororities
and Fraternities on campus wa
dealt with as a piece of larger
areas, mainly "residential life
and social opportunities," said
Brenemann.
Although the Commis
sion expressed an interest in
global outreach, it did not get
involved in the debate of inter
national students transferring
their college financial aid to
study abroad, a heated topic of
debate among students for over
— qj

three years. The President's
office is evaluating the process,
though it was not part of the
Commission.
Still, the overall attitude
about the Commission report
is positive. "The successful
completion of the Commission
on the Future of Gettysburg
College will help the Board of
Trustees develop a clear action
plan for review and eventual
implementation for the benefit
of our current and future stu
dents, especially in relation to
programs curriculum and fos
tering of an active and dynamic
learning environment," said
Haaland.

Irish music comes to Gettysburg

by Cara Masucci
Staff Reporter Cultural diversity within
the college seems to be the only
thing that people are talking
about these days. The college
faculty and many students wish
to see more diversity in all as
pects of college life. One group
on campus which is adding to
diversity is the band the War
rior Poets. For senior band
member Paul "Hutch"
Hutchinson and sophomores
Jay Spiese and Ian Isherwood,
the group is more than just mu
sic; it is a way of life.
To an unaware listener it
would seem as though the band
has been together forever.
Their one-liners and unique in
terpretations of traditional Irish
folk music are so well put-to
gether it is hard to believe the
band was formed only a little
over three months ago.

According to band man
ager Isherwood, the idea of
starting an Irish band just
popped into his head one day.
Speaking on the telephone with
classmate and friend Spiese
over Thanksgiving break, the
two decided to approach
Hutchinson about becoming a
member of the infant band.
According the three men, this
was what they refer to as "hare
brained scheme number one!"
Approaching Hutchinson
was a unique experience, ac
cording to Isherwood, because

upon the mention of the idea,
Hutchinson pulled out an Irish
whistle. Isherwood states in ref
erence to Hutchinson_'s whistle
playing, "He played like sweet
music." It appeared as though
the two men had been thinking
along the same lines. When
Spiese commented that he had
often thought about it too, it
became clear these guys be
longed together in a band. It
was only natural the band
should play Irish music because
all the guys grew up on it. From
that point on, the alliance was
cemented.
As soon as the band was

formed, it appeared as though
they had a mission: the search
for material and a place to play
it. According to Isherwood, he
had been in two previous
bands, Spiese has been singing
since he was born, and as for
Hutchinson, well, he sings in
the shower.
According to
Hutchinson, all of the songs are
traditional Irish folk songs that
the band has arranged them¬

selves. The group definitely
gives the songs a unique twist,
with one-iiners added on in the
pauses of the music and the
good-natured ribbing between
band members and their friends
in the audience during the per
formance.
As soon as the group had
a couple of songs arranged,
they decided they needed to
make themselves known. At
the last moment, the group de
cided to play open mic during
Coffeehouse one evening early
this semester. The perfor
mance was greeted with much
enthusiasm and delight from
the audience. According to the
group, who later referred to it
as "harebrained scheme num
ber two," it worked.
The group gained confi¬

dence in their abilities and de
cided while hanging out one
night, that Buckley's, a local
Irish pub, needed a house band.
So was born "harebrained
scheme number three."
When they approached
Buckley's, the Warrior Poets
were received with a warm en
thusiasm for what they wanted
to do. According to Spiese,
"they were willing to help us
out and work on what was

needed." The group is not
ashamed to admit that they
were so overjoyed they actually
started hopping and jumping
around in excitement.
Spiese said that the bar set
them up for two big concerts
this semester. One is the pub's
year anniversary, and the other
was last Friday's Guinness
Toast.
One of the first problems
they encountered was the fact
that the guys had only three
songs arranged. Says
Isherwood, the group "worked
really hard creating material to
put this thing together, and we
did it!"
They also had to practice
their material somewhere. At
first the group practiced in
Hutchinson's apartment, but

due to the complaints of neigh
bors, were forced to practice in
Schmucker and the recording
booth at WZBT.
Practicing in the record
ing booth allows the guys to
critique their songs as they go
along. It also lead to "hare
brained scheme number four."
Isherwood says that the War
rior Poets would like to try
their hand at recording an al¬

bum. The band's lineup in
cludes songs like "Drunken
Sailor," "Whisky You're the
Devil," "Donald Where's Your
Trousers?," and the crowd
pleasing "Jolly Grog." When
ever the band plays the song, a
point comes where the entire
audience shouts "Arg!" The
band now gets requests for that
song all the time.
Daniel Jewitt, a friend of
the band's members and most
likely their biggest fan, com
ments that a lot of people re
ally love them. The audience
gets involved and starts danc
ing and singing along with the
group. He also states they have
developed their own "groupie"
following at Buckley's. The
group would also like to point

out, though, that Jewitt is the
official jigger of the Warrior Po
ets' world tour!
The guys are also im
pressed with the number of fac
ulty members who come to
their concerts. Rumor has it
that some even get up and jig.
The group has really
come together in the past few
weeks, playing at Buckley's,
Coffeehouse, and the talent
show two weeks ago. Accord
ing to the band, the competi
tion at the talent show was re
ally tough, but they had a very
enjoyable time. Because of
their rising popularity here on
campus, they are also setting up
a BYOB St. Patrick's Day show
with the college. In addition,
they will play at Buckley's twice
that day.
No matter how much the
group plays, they never cease
to amaze their fans. The band

can be found on stage in what
the group terms "the just-off
the-boat look." The guys de
cided to dress as their grandfa
thers would have, in typical
immigrant garb that includes
hats and boots. Since sequins
are not their style, the guys
opted for a more realistic late
nineteenth century look.
The Warrior Poets hope
to accomplish much more than
actually being a success on
stage. They hope they can help
restore the dying art of the
Irish-American folk song and
unite all Irish people under the
guise of music. According to
Spiese and Isherwood, "all Irish
people can appreciate our mu
sic." The men have a fantastic
time together, and enjoy the
good-natured ribbing they ex
change. All three guys are im
pressed with the people who
will come up to them and tell
them good luck on the day of a
concert, or that they played
well the night before.

Summed up in three
words by the Warrior Poets
themselves, the band is
"drinking, loving, and fight
ing." Interpret that however
you wish.



Gryz and bear it

by Jeremy Kuhar
Contributing Reporter
Walking into this office,
I notice a mountain bike sitting
quietly in the corner. As one
may expect, Dr. Joseph
Grzybowski is not only inter
ested in chemisty. He is the
type of person that his students
can trust and work with.
I asked Gryz whether
chemistry had been his first
choice in a career, whether he
had known since he was a child
that this was what he wanted
to base his life on. He replies,
with only a split-second of hesi
tation, "pretty much."
Grzybowski was born to
Joseph and Stella Grzybowski
in 1950. He grew up in Wilkes
Barre, Pennsylvania, and lived
in the same house until he
moved out to attend graduate
school at Case Western Re¬

serve. As a child his major out
of-the-house activity was his
involvement in Boy Scouts.
His interest in chemistry
began at an early age. His in¬

ability to explore chemistry as
a child led to an anticipation
of high school. He knew that
he would be able to take a
chemistry course in school, and
that he would enjoy it. He
maintained an A average in that

course.
At Kings College in
Wilkes-Barre, he enjoyed tak
ing many chemistry classes
from the simple introductory
level chemistry to the 300 and
400 level courses which would
help to define his career path.
At Kings College he
joined the college Glee Club,
among other things. While in
this choral group, he made
many normal friends as well as
some strange ones, and found
that bizarre things happen in
college.
His students may be dis
appointed to find out that one
of Gryz's friends from college
described him as "pretty tame."
Gryz has also been de
scribed by the same friends as
the type of person that could
always be counted on in a jam.
If one of his friends had too

much to drink, they could
count on him to provide a ride
home.
After he completed his
undergraduate degree,
Grzybowski continued on to
complete his doctorate at Case
Western Reserve University.
The completion of his Ph.D.
occurred in August of 1977.
Immediately following
his graduation from Case West
ern, he went on to work as a
postdoctoral research associate
in the Chemistry Department
of Ohio State University.
Gryz came to Gettysburg
in 1979 when he took the po
sition of Assistant Professor in
the Department of Chemistry.
When his tenure came in 1986,
he was advanced to the posi
tion of Associate Professor of
Chemistry.

In the short term scope of
his research, Grzybowski does
much of his work with his stu
dents in order to give them a
greater "hands-on" approach
to chemistry.
Now a full professor for
three years, Gryz is considered

to be a "very good teacher." He
knows that just as during his
college days, there are often
unexpected situations that arise
and cannot be avoided. For this
reason, he can be lenient to
wards deadlines, as long as that
privilege is not abused.
Grzybowski's most hated
tasks as a teacher are those as
sociated with grades and the
distribution of those marks. He
sometimes believes that grades
do not accurately reflect the
accomplishments of the indi
vidual.
Gryz tries to get to know
his students on a personal level;
one way in which he does this

is by playing sports. He espe
cially likes to play softball with
his research students. He goes
out drinking with those his stu
dents that are of legal age.
Outside of the school,
Gryz enjoys riding his bike, day
hiking and cross country skiing.
Grzybowski is the type of
professor that all students
would like to have. He takes
the time to answer your ques
tions, and will answer them
with patience.
He is a teacher that you
can come to know on a per
sonal level and form a relation
ship with that will last your
entire career.

In Case You Missed It

Gunman of Christmas present

by Eileen O'Donnell
Movie Columnist
Ah, Connecticut at
Christmas time. There's noth
ing like it: snow falling, a na
tivity scene in front of City
Hall, family coming home for
the holidays. Only for the fam
ily in The Ref, this Christmas is
going to be a bit different.
They're hostages.
After a botched robbery,
cat burglar Gus (Denis Leary)
is a man on the run. His part¬

ner has taken off in the getaway
car, and now he's a wanted man
stuck in Old Baybrook, CT.
What can he do but take a hos
tage until he finds a way out?
Gus carjacks Caroline and
Lloyd Chausser (Judy Davis
and Kevin Spacey), who have
just come from the marriage
counselor. Lloyd and Caroline
do nothing but argue with each
other, and Gus is quick to real
ize his mistake in choosing this
couple—he's hijacked the
couple from hell.

Gus needs to find a way
to get in touch with his part
ner so he can get out of Con
necticut and get on his way to
Jamaica with the loot. But that
won't be so easy. He needs a
place to hide out and to think

clearly, so
he had
Lloyd take
him to
their
house.
Mean
while,
Lloyd's
mother
and his
brother's
family are
one their
way down
from Bos
ton. To
top it all

off, Lloyd and Caroline's juve
nile delinquent son Jessie (Rob
ert Steinmiller, Jr.) is on his way
home from military school for
Christmas Eve dinner. Gus

could not have taken a more
dysfunctional family hostage.
Finally getting in touch
with his partner, Gus tells his
to commandeer a boat so they
can avoid the roadblocks and
get out. Now Gus has no

choice but to wait for the call
to say everything is clear. And
he can't afford to take any
more hostages. So Gus pre
tends to be Caroline and

Lloyd's marriage counselor, Dr.
Wong (his mother was Irish and
his father...wasn't).
This masquerade proves
to be hilarious as they try to
fool Lloyd's overbearing
mother, his pushy sister-in-law,

and his
wimpy brother.
The
Ref is a
very un
conven-tional
movie.
The ve
hicle for
Leary 's
dark,
cynical
comedy
should

be by
by by

not viewed

those who are offended
harsh or crude language. But
for those who are not offended
by it, Leary (Wag the Dog) is a
riot. Spacey (Midnight in the

Garden of Good and Evil) and
Davis (Deconstrcting Harry),
playing the dysfunctional mar
ried couple, fight as if they've
really been married for many
years. Christine Baranski (The
Birdcage) lends a great deal to
the movie as Lloyd's snotty sis
ter-in-law, and his audacious
mother is played by Glynis
Johns (While You Were Sleep
ing). Perhaps the funniest thing
about this movie is that it can

be seen as a social commentary
on family life. None of the
people in this family respect
each other, and it takes an irri
tated thief to put them back on
the right track.
Leary's maniacal ravings
will make you laugh, but if you
look deeper, you will be dis
turbed by what it is he is rav
ing about.
So if you're into comedy,
psychology, and sociology, rent
The Ref. You could probably
write a paper for class about it.



Reel Hits & Misses Only a Fool would miss this Kiss

by Dan Larkin and Mike Petro
Movie Columnists
Mike: Ever see a movie
preview of a romantic comedy
and think "Oh no, here conies
another one!" Well, you may
never have, but I certainly
have. Let's face it, there are
only so many basic movie for
mulas, and the romantic com
edy is one of them. The only
trouble with this format is that
it seems increasingly difficult to
come up with original and
quality movies.
However, the new movie
Kissing a Fool, which stars
David Schwimmer and Jason
Lee, delivers the goods. Kiss-

ing a Fool is a funny, original,
and quite engaging movie.
Dan: Well, I'd hardly call
it original. There's only so
much one can do with these
romantic triangle things, and
the plots of them usually turn
out pretty much the same. But
with movies like this, original
ity doesn't matter as much as
how it works within the con
fines of the genre. And as far as
romantic comedies go, Kissing
a Fool is a pretty darn good one.
The premise of " this one
is really quite simple (as is the
case with most romantic com
edies). David Schwimmer
(Breast Men, The Pallbearer)
plays Max Abbit, a Chicago

sports anchor who has about as
much trouble getting women as
Night Court's Dan Fielding.
Well, Max has a best
friend/author Jay, played by
Jason Lee {Chasing Amy,
Mallrats), who introduces him
to his beautiful and nearly per
fect editor, Samantha.
[Note for the classes of
2000, 2001, Night Court was

by a guest at the wedding of
Samantha and one of the two
guys. Which one will it be?
Well, it shouldn't be too tough
to figure out, but it's pretty fun
anyway.

Needless to say, Max falls
in love and sets about setting
his mind on marriage. How
ever, Max isn't so sure about
Samantha, who, by the way, is
played wonderfully by relative
newcomer Mili Avital (Dead
Man, Stargate). Due to his
own insecurities. Max tries to

get his best friend, Jay, to test
Samantha, saying "I want you
to try and get Sam to sleep with
you." Schwimmer and Lee do a
nice job playing roles that are
a refreshing change from some
of their more well known char
acters. Viewers (like me) who
generally find Schwimmer's
whiny, sensitive Ross character
from Friends really annoying,
will be pleased with Max.
Schwimmer does an ex
cellent job playing a real jerk,
kind of an anti-Ross. Lee, who
could easily become typecast as
the wonderfully obnoxious
Banky from Chasing Amy, does
a nice job playing a nice guy.
Now I won't spoil the
movie for you by telling you
what happens, but I will say
this: this is a good movie and
one that keeps the viewer in
terested. The dialogue is witty
and engaging, and the actors
do a solid job.

I personally do not like
David Schwimmer, and usually
try and avoid him, yet in this
movie he does an excellent job.

Jason Lee captures that hysteri
cal sarcasm and cynicism which
made him so enjoyable in the
two Kevin Smith features
which have made him so no
ticeable.
Add in an enjoyable and
believable performance by
Avital and some familiar sup
porting cast members and you
have a movie that works.
Maybe guess I'm getting
soft in my old age, because I fell
for Kissing a Fool like a brick.
Jason Lee and the surprisingly
good David Schwimmer turn in
solid performances, which carry
what would be an otherwise
predictably sappy movie. Sure,
it's formula, but it works.
Three stars (out of five).
I liked Kissing a Fool; the
story and the actors made me
happy to have committed part
of my afternoon to it.

I tend to be harsh on ro
mantic comedies, mainly be
cause I haven't liked many of
them since When Harry Met
Sally, but without hesitation I
give this an enthusiastic three
and a half stars. See it!

An expedition in the supermarket...

by Kim Redding and Karen
Hesselbach Contributing Reporters
Don't you find entering
a supermarket intimidating?
Some individuals have no idea
where to start as they walk up
and down the wide aisles full
of various and unlimited
amounts of food products. An
often pondered question is
"What is the right product to
purchase?" There is no right or
wrong, but healthy food is im
portant.
Buying healthy food in
the supermarket is an issue that
is widely discussed and quickly
becoming a popular subject
when wondering what to eat.
The government has provided
a dietary guideline for the
American people which re
sembles a pyramid. This pyra
mid guides a consumer of what
to eat daily. To maintain a
healthy weight, it advises eat¬

ing a variety of foods in order
to consume the proper nutri
ents and right amount of calo
ries. The base of the food
pyramid is filled with bread,
cereal, rice and pasta. It is
stated that people should eat
six to eleven servings daily. Fill
ing the pyramid above the base
are fruits and vegetables. The
proper amount of daily fruit
consumption is two to four
servings, and three to five serv
ings for vegetables.
The next tier is shared by
meat, poultry, fish, dry beans,
eggs, and nuts, as well as milk,
yogurt, and cheese. The meat
and poultry level advises two
to three servings daily, which
is also the advisable amount for
the dairy group. Finally, top
ping the pyramid is the fats,
oils, and sweets group. This is
the least important category,
which should be consumed
sparingly.

After pushing the heavy,
squealing cart through the au
tomatic doors on a routine
shopping expedition, one finds
the veggies jumping out first
because they are situated right
inside the entrance. Maybe we,
the public, should take this as a
hint. Vegetables are one of the
most important components of
our diet. Most of the time, con
sumers wheel on through, only
picking up some lettuce for
salad, and tomatoes to compli
ment it.
Why not take a few more
minutes to try something new,
like the snap peas, or perhaps
the asparagus. Instead of turn
ing your nose up, why not be
daring?
After the consumer moves
past the veggies, the routine
continues into the breads and
the meat. It's time to stop be
ing monotonous and start be
ing creative when shopping.

This creativity can add to the
benefits of a healthy shopping
trip. The following list is pro
vided to show you, the con
sumer, what is actually avail
able to be purchased.
Some foods that are dif
ferent but are still healthy are:
Thomas' Bagels, Healthy Val
ley Health Tarts (all flavors),
Sahara Whole Wheat Pita,
Buena Vita Tortillas, Pillsbury
Pizza Dough, Wasa Crispbread,
Nabisco Oyster Crackers,
Devonsheer Melba Rounds,
Krispy Saltines, Ry-Krisp,
Yoplait Light Yogurt, I Can't
Believe It's Not Butter Spray,
Sorrento Fat Free Ricotta,
Skim or 1% lowfat milk, Kraft
Healthy Favorites Cheddar
Cheese.

Also, Quaker Cream of
Wheat, Kellogg's Raisin Bran,
Post Bran Flakes, Total Corn
Flakes, Nabisco Shredded
Wheat, Musselman's Apple
Sauce, Legume Chicken Style

Vegetable Soup, Aunt Jemima's
French Toast, Kraft Free May
onnaise, and Skippy's Reduced
Fat Peanut Butter.
Learning to buy healthy
food takes time and effort. To
start your new routine, try buy
ing at least one item of each
type of food above per shop
ping trip.
Hopefully consumers
reading this will gain some
helpful information which will
lead to a successful, healthy
shopping trip. In closing, we
leave you with a few more help
ful hints when venturing out to
the supermarket.
1) NEVER food shop on
an empty stomach. This leads
to impulse buys, such as cook
ies or junk food.
2) Try and break bad hab
its. Visit the veggie section
more often. They're not that
bad!

3) Be creative with your
diet. Bon Appetit!


A light-hearted Gospel sets the foot tapping

by Barb Dickson
Features Editor
Cotton Patch Gospel,
the play performed last week
end by the Owl & Nightin
gale Players, tells the Book of
Matthew as set in Georgia,
and was billed as brimming
with good humor and sure to
set the audience's toes tap
ping. The show proved true
on both counts; I have never
found the story of Jesus so
completely amusing, and I
often found myself tapping
my foot along with the mu¬

. The musical, however,
was perhaps a little too funny.
There are many humorous
bits (three Oriental scholars
bringing the baby Jesus a gold
American Express card, a
musical group that sings about
wanting to be spitballs to
God). Maybe the humor
helped bring some people
closer to the story, but I have
never thought of the story of
Jesus as a particularly funny
one (well, except in relation
to Monty Python's Life of
Brian). It's a serious story; I
can only hope that the humor
is meant to make the story
more accessible.
Reco Grigsby, who
makes his acting debut with

this production, is outstanding
as Jesus. His voice is wonderful
and the audience was naturally
drawn to him. His counterpoint
in the song "Goin' to Atlanta,"
when he comes to grip with his
fate, is one of the most power
ful points of the show. I hope
that Grigsby continues to per
form for the theater department.
The rest of the cast played
numerous parts, but there were
some standouts. Tim Johnsen
was extremely amusing as Rock,
one of Jesus' disciples. I know I
just bashed the comedy, but if

they were going for humor,
Johnsen performed wonderfully.
His voice was very strong as
well, particularly shining in the
song "Jud."
One thing I have always
wondered about the story of
Jesus is what happened to Mary
and Joseph once Jesus grew up.
Cotton Patch addresses this is
sue as the sad parents tell Jesus
that "You are Still My Boy."
Glen Beck and Jennifer
MacMurtrie play Mary and Jo
seph, and through this song, pro
vide another poignant moment
of the musical.

Another standout was Brad
Cerelliasjohn theBaptizer. The
character was quite the South
ern preacher; it was all I could
do to keep myself from shout
ing "Allelulia!" with the cast.

Mentions also should be
made of Samantha Gregg,
whose voice soared throughout
the show; Michael Harp with
his wonderful facial expres
sions; and Duncan Niederer as
Matthew and a Cattle Farmer.
He showed emotions that ran
the gamut—from hick to a se
rious observer in awkward situ¬

.
"I Did It" and "Danger
ous Man" were two of the
more memorable songs. It's
interesting that these are two
of the darker songs of the show.
Gregg's solo in "I Did It" is sim
ply beautiful.
The choreography for the
show was rather intricate in
many parts, and kudos to the
cast for getting it right and
making it look good (though
there were parts when it didn't
look like they quite had
rhythm).
Technically, the show was
great. The lighting effects were
outstanding, and it became a
favorite pastime of mine to
watch what they would be us
ing a certain table (which
doubled as part of the set) for
next.

The set was very interest
ing, perfect for this type ol
show. There was a piece on the
stage that could be interpreted
to be either a telephone pole

or a cross, which I believe was
the purpose of the piece. But
since Jesus was lynched in this
interpretation, not crucified, it
was a somewhat confusing
piece. On the other hand, there
were negative aspects to the
show. I could barely make out
a word of the opening song,
"Somethin's Brewin' in
Gainesville." The orchestra
overpowered the cast, who
needed to articulate more and
project. However, they did fall
more into the show as it went
on and became easier to under
stand. Many of the male cast
members had somewhat weak,
though passable, voices. The
women were a bit better,
though they occasionally got a
little screechy in some of the
high parts. However, since
most of the songs were very up
tempo, this didn't matter too

much. One thing that really
bothers me about this show is
the fact that it changes the Gos
pel. Too many liberties were
taken; Jesus did not blatantly
tell his disciples that he was
going to die in Jerusalem (or
Atlanta, as the case may be),
and he was not killed in the
middle of nowhere where no
body could see.
Because of this, the show
did not have much emotional
impact on me; it was simply
amusing. However, it did have
a strong emotional impact on
others around me.
Overall, it was a very en
joyable musical. It has its nega
tive aspects, but what doesn't?
The show received standing
ovations at all six perfor
mances, which definitely says
something. It was well worth
watching, a pleasant experi
ence, and I'm glad I went.

Library columnist
Q: If I look up a book on
Muscat and it says it's in cata
loging, does that mean I can't
get it? A: You're in luck because
you can request the item you're
interested in right on Muscat.
Once your item comes up on
the screen saying that __j_^

the status in i
"in catalog- _^^ _P_*
ing" or ^^_N
"bindery" or
"on order,"
choose the
" + " option
on the
menu be
low. Then
choose the _^ ^^
command let- ^^
ter "G" (for "get")
to request the item

you desire. The screen ^™
will then prompt you to en
ter your name, your ID num
ber, and any special instructions
you may have.'
The book you want will
then be recalled, rush cata
loged, or reserved in your
name, so whenever it's avail
able, it's all yours.
Q: What does the loca
tion "Oversize Books" mean
on Muscat?
A: It means that the par
ticular book you're looking up

is over 28.5 centimeters tall
(that's more than 11 inches, for
those of you who are not met
ric-inclined). Many publishers
choose a taller format because
they want to emphasize the vi
sual content of the book.
For example, many art
books are oversized. We shelve
oversized books together in the
southeast corner of

back

from the
stairs, turn left, and go all the
way back.

Conflict & Consensus
~~ I "Stay on the macadam!"
to distract

by Rick Deutsch
Columnist My grade school recess
monitor, Mr. Manno, a fright
ening individual, is only
memorable for one piece of
advice: "Stay on the mac
adam!" Surprisingly, while
none of us knew what mac
adam was, we clearly under
stood the command and fol
lowed orders. We stayed on
the macadam and off the grass.
Sometimes I wish we had
a Mr. Manno here at Gettys¬

burg College. Something has
happened to the campus physi
cally in the past year. When I
had visitors here last year they
told me they were impressed
with Gettysburg's beauty and
they remarked how lucky I was
to go to school here. This
year's visitors have called the
campus "nice," and that both
ers me. My final decision to
attend Gettysburg was in part
based on the physical design of
the campus. To lose that
beauty would be unsettling.

Anyone who has lived,
or is currently living, in
Hanson will tell you that there
is a phenomenal shortcut
through the small bushes that
guard the cement path, which
removes at least forty feet of

paved pathway. All students
have to do is walk across the
lawn. I was proud to be one of
the people who introduced the
bypass to my friends. I insisted
that it saved valuable walking
time. Needless to say, once the
grass became a matted foot
path, everyone started using
the shortcut. Once March
came around there was noth
ing but a brown muddy stripe
dissecting the lawn. The
bushes along the path, subject
to months of abuse, died as

well. So there's a burnt out
patch on the side of Hanson
Hall. Not a big deal, right? It
isn't a big deal, of course.
However, similar patches ap
pear all over the campus. For
example, the grass between
Breidenbaugh and Weidensall is
turning brown from being
trampled, as is the grass in front
of Servo and in front of the
CUB. Stine Hall is circum
scribed by a pale brown ring,
separating the dorm and its
once green lawn.

As students, we can t con
trol all environmental issues on
campus like the puddles that
form from our Seattle-like rain
or our ongoing mud problem.
However, we can easily control
damage we cause on campus.

Gettysburg isn't like some
boarding schools that give stu
dents detention or fines for
walking on the grass. I do not
think draconian measures will
solve the problem. What is re
quired, though, is a conscious
effort on the part of everyone
who walks through campus to
observe simple acts of civility.
In retrospect, for all his faults,
Mr. Manno was right about
that. Ask anyone who's been to
Yankee Stadium for a day game
and been mesmerized by the
beauty of the giant green car
pet stretching across the out
field. Ask anyone who's stood
at the White House gates and
admired the lawn. Ask anyone
who's done a good lawn mow
ing job. Ask them, and listen
to the descriptions of a green,
well-manicured lawn. Maybe
that will change your thoughts
about the grass we all tramp
upon.

And if it doesn't, do what
I do. Picture Mr. Manno stand
ing in front of you, dressed in
cold grey pinstripes, twirling
his keys around his finger as
they strike his hand with a
strong metallic thud. He sees
what you are about to do and
he yells "Stay on the mac
adam!" It always works for me.

Consider this

The Commission on the
Future met this past week to of
fer its final report. The value of
this event is a subject which in
evitably arises.
The intentions of these
participants are doubtlessly
genuine; however, too many per
tinent issues, such as tenure re
form, the role of the Greek sys
tem, and the rights of interna
tional students, were neglected
or glossed over.
These issues are all worth
the attention of the campus.
Moreover, these issues are ones
which can and should be handled
by the existing campus commu
nity. With all due respect to all
of the alumni and friends of the
campus that participated in the
Commission on the Future, their
suggestions are well received, but
in terms of substantive changes,
their detachment from the day
to day operations of the college
puts them at a disadvantage.
There are many talented
and involved students on this
campus, as the recent close sen
ate races shows. Furthermore,
there are many dedicated profes
sors who possess the knowledge
and vision to shape a better cam
pus, both in the short and long
term. Students and faculty
should come together to address
the pressing issues on this cam
pus. For instance, is it time to
abolish the Greek system? Is the
$50,000 grant for student activi
ties merely a bone being thrown

to the students us
from calling for real social
change? Does the administration
truly care about what students
and faculty think? Recent ten
ure issues seem to suggest the
answer is no.
It is time for the student
body to throw down the gaunt
let to the administration of this
college and push for changes
now. Planning is fine, but action
is needed. Current students and
faculty should be the Commis
sion for the Future and not
merely "resources to the Com
mission on the Future Task
Forces."
Most of the changes sug
gested by the Task Force will not
be implemented until current
students have long since gradu
ated, if at all. Even so, it is the
current campus community who
should have had a major say on
the Commission. We are the
ones who truly know what is
going on at Gettysburg. We are
the ones who know what needs
to be changed.
The Commission on the
Future is a good idea on paper,
and what they turned out are a
lot of ideas that look good on
paper. Many are too vague to
be implemented. Many are steps
that seem pointless.
The usefulness of the
Commission is highly question
able. Kudos to the Commission
for their work, but a question re
mains: how much is it truly
worth?

To the Editor:
The biographical sketch
about me in the February 6 is
sue of The Gettysburgian was
a reasonable summary of a
conversation I had with the au
thor many months ago. A few
inaccuracies, however, should
be noted. The statement that
I give ",.. difficult pop quizzes"
is not correct. This should
read "piece-of-cake unan

not conduct research on
fullerenes, an interesting class

one in which I have been ac

CONFLICT & Consensus
Sacred ritual or silly waste of time?
To the editor:

Throughout the course of
the three years that 1 have spent
at Gettysburg College one ot
the most divisive debates that
has perpetually raged in the
The Gettysburgian has been the
struggle between the support
ers and detractors of the Greek
system raised some valid
points, such as the error of
overgeneralizing the tendencies
of such a large group of people,
I was compelled to wonder
what exactly these people are
out to accomplish during their
stay here in sunny Pennsylva¬

. Across the four elo
quently stated pieces, the edi
torials drove home the pro
found importance of their
struggle for the good of man
kind, and the contribution of
the "Turkey Trot" in the con
flict to save the free world.
Great. I do applaud the ef
forts of all organizations that
promote service to the less
fortunate. However, J
throughout my daily trav- J
els in the mail-room and J
Servo, I have more often 1
overheard such tales of the m
heroism of "Buddha's" I
keg
weekend than of wide- M _^
spread Greek enthusiasm ^^
about working in a soup

kitchen. There are many op
portunities on this campus for
caring individuals to contribute
to society, including GECO,
Habitat for Humanity, and the
Center for Public Service to
name but a few. The people
who make a true commitment
to these organizations deserve
recognition, for they are the
ones who are working to bet
ter the world in which we live.
If you are interested in making
a contribution to a program for
the general good you are in
luck at Gettysburg College, for
there are many groups that are
dedicated to a variety of noble
causes. I'm sorry, but the "An
chor Splash" does not rank as
a philanthropic feat.
One of the contributing
writers passionately argued for

research to be done in the mat
ter, before the Greek system is
dismissed as a haven of alco
hol abuse and loud music. He
compared his fraternity to a
political party. Let's be serious.
Can you really argue that each
organization of the Greek sys
tem has its own platform,
agenda, or ideology? If the do,
then I was greatly misled in my

penences ^^^^^^^
in the system. ^^^
Like many unfortunate
freshman souls who find them
selves in the middle of the
farmlands of southern PA with

nothing else to do, I too briefly
participated in the rush pro
cess. In addition, I have also
been to several Greek social
events. Not once was I given
any information about the
proud "ideals of the chapter."
Never did i meet a member of
the system who gave any indi
cation of any individual idea
behind their organization. In
the end, I concluded that each
fraternity was the same as the
next, and that warm Natty
Light tastes the same in a plas
tic cup no matter where you

drink it.
This brings me to my next
point. This is Gettysburg Col
lege, "college" being the opera
tive word. The main goal of
everyone attending this liberal
arts institution should be aca
demic excellence. In defense
of the Greek system, one of the
articles boasted that every fe
male must acheive at least a 2.2
GPA in order to take part of the
rush process. You call
that aca¬

demic ex- ^^^^^^
cellence? Now I'm ^^^
not sure what with the
tricky 4.0 equals an A "system,
but 2.2 isn't too good. No less
than four of my six professors
this semester have complained
about the lethargic state of a
large portion of their unpre
pared students. Two of those
have also asked when the rush
ing and pledging process would
finally be over, and griped
about its connection to poor
attendance. It is not surpris
ing that the faculty of this col
lege once voted to abolish the
Greek system. I find it hard to

believe that the professors are
no more than a mob of heart
less, fun-hating demons, at
tempting to crush the good
time of a few honest pupils
under their jackbooted heel of
oppression. It's more likely
that the anti-Greek sentiments
of a great many of our faculty
are driven by their care for the
maintenance of the high aca
demic standards of this institu¬

tion. Indeed, it is troubling
when before the beginning of
class a group a fresh
man fe

^^^ Bpivated to run to Sub
way to retrieve a hoagie
for one of his new "brothers"
at 3 a.m. on a Tuesday morn
ing. Perhaps I am lazy, but
something would have to be
pretty important to get me out
of bed that early with classes
early the next morning. I don't
think that my buddy's craving
for processed lunchmeat would
be enough to do the trick. With
the hefty cost to attend Gettys
burg College, one must re
evaluate one's priorities. If you
came to this college motivated

to take part in these pointless
rituals or to drink until projec
tile vomiting is achieved then
you are likely to be successful
with little effort. On the other
hand, you could strive for
something more meaningful. I
am sure that there are many
Greeks who have maintained a
high GPA here at Gettysburg
College. However, the Greek
system as a whole has long suf
fered from a reputation of the
poor academic performance of
its members. If this is merely a
fasle stereotype then I suggest
providing better evidence of
your "high values" than an ane
mic GPA requirement of 2.2.
I am not an advocate of
abolishing the Greek system,
and to tell you the truth it is of
little consequence to me if it
stays or goes. I simply believe
that all students of this college
should remember why they are
here. The education that is

available here is of immense
worth. After all, you are foot
ing a bill that comes damned
close to $30,000 per year.
However, it is not the job of
professors to pour knowledge
into students' heads, as one
pours a 40 of Colt 45 down
one's throat; It is every indi
viduals responsibility to make
his or her stay here worthwhile.
Instead of hiding behind claims
of high academic standards
(2.2?!) and the supposed sa
credness of the rituals of Greek
life, I suggest you examine your
priorities. Don't squander the
opportunity that you have here
at Gettysburg College. In the
immortal words of our be
loved, former Vice President
Dan Quayle in an address be
fore a civil rights, "It is terrible
to live with a wasted mind."
(What he meant was that a
mind is a terrible thing to
waste, but you get his drift.)
Sincerely yours,
Bridging the gap to the
twenty-first century,

CONft/CT & Consensus
Gimme that old

time religion

By Jay Spiese
Columnist People who are active in
social work on campus are of
ten frustrated by the level of
apathy on this campus. One
person I interviewed last semes
ter said that the campus is typi
cally four or five years behind
the latest trends. A quick
glance through old issues of the
Gettysburgian in the library
bares this out. Streaking first
caught on at Gettysburg about
six years after the rest of the
nation had put their pants back

on. In a more serious vein,
Gettysburg College seems to be
breaking with this tradition. In
at least one area we are in synch
with mainstream America and
that is religion. This nation
appears to be entering into a
new period of religious revival.
Look at the major forces in
politics today and one finds a
high degree of religious in
volvement. Everyone from the
Christian Coalition to the Rev
erend Jesse Jackson have given
their voices to the debate.
In social work, religion
once again holds the prominent
role. Find any soup kitchen,
homeless shelter, or other grass
roots charity and you will prob
ably find a church sponsoring
it.

Unlike previous revivals
this one appears to be more
ecumenical. For once Roman
Catholics are involved in and
are helping to shape the revival
to an equal degree as their Prot
estant brothers and sisters.
At our local level we see
the small signs. Go to service
on Sunday and see how many
more students attend now then
did a year ago. I know that the
Catholic services see more at
tendance and participation
than last year. This year, in
fact, a group of Catholic stu
dents will receive the sacrament
of Confirmation (congratula
tions by the way). Friends who
attend the Protestant services
say they are seeing similar reli¬

gious awakening.
By saying we are entering
a period of religious revival
does not mean that we are do
ing a stereotypic revival. There
is no tent where we gather to
hear a man call us to repen
tance before we are damned.
We are not out singing hymns
as people walk up to a podium
and testify to how God saved
them from their wickedness.
This is a minority on our cam
pus. Most of us come from a
mainstream denomination like
Episcopalian, Lutheran, and
Catholic which do not typically
use these practices. What we
are doing on this campus is
harkening back to our denomi
national roots, expressing the
practices anew, and coming to
gether with other denomina
tion to express their common
ality.

Neither are we constantly
thinking or even fully conscious
of what is going on around us
as a revival. Most of us see our
return to faith as a personal
choice with little bearing on the
world beyond the chapel doors.
If religion is important enough
for us to want to attend services
and participate in the rites of
our particular faith then ele
ments of it will surface in our
action. This does not mean
that we are constantly fretting
over our salvation or bemoan
ing our every sin. Some of us
may simply pray others may
read scripture. In short we are

humble sinners trying to be
saints. I ask your indulgence for
my use of the Christian portion
of our campus. I use them
merely because they are the
largest segment and are thus
the easiest to observe. But the
revival I am speaking of goes
beyond Christianity. The fast
est growing religion in America
is a relative new comer, Islam.
Other eastern religions like
Bhuddism are also growing.
The points while we may not
be leading this movement we
can and should take pride that
we are a part of it.


Trust busting on the hill

by Cammie Grant
Columnist

Netscape Navigator instead of
Microsoft's browser." Wednes
day morning, Senate Judiciary
Committee chairman Orin
Hatch stated that the hearing
is not meant "tor criticizing or
attacking any single company."
In the hearing, James
Barksdale, CEO of Netscape
Communications, and Scott
McNealy, CEO of Sun
Microsystems, made efforts to
try and gain Hatch's support.
Bill Gates claims, "As you
know, a monopolist, by defini
tion, is a company that has the
ability to restrict entry by new
firms and unilaterally control
price. Microsoft can do nei
ther." Gates does not want the
federal government to inter
vene in his company and its
progress.

Microsoft chief Bill Gates
appeared before the Senate Ju
diciary Committee on Wednes
day. It is thought that
Microsoft is abusing its mo
nopoly power. James
Barksdale, chief executive of
ficer of Netscape Communica
tions fears that "unless (abuse
of monopoly powers) ad
dressed through enforcement
of our antitrust laws, [it] will
adversely affect the course of
American commerce and com
munications in the information
age." ABC News stated, "The
Justice Department charges
Microsoft threatened to revoke
Compaq Computer's license
for Windows 95 (Microsoft's
bestselling operating system)
after the computer-maker tried
to steer Internet surfers to

ABC News reported
"Microsoft chief Bill Gates told
the Senate today that his com
pany does not have a monopoly

and that the government
should keep its hands off the
software industry."
Microsoft brought in 100
billion dollars to the national
economy last year, claims
Gates. So, leave the man alone
as long as he is not breaking any
laws. Contributing that much
money to the national economy
is helpful to our entire nation
and should not be shunned.
Business is a game, and must be
played by all players fairly; even
if one of the richest men in the
world is playing. Having
money does not mean you have
power to break the laws.
My advice to Barksdale
and McNealy, you both are
right to make sure that the
game is being played fairly,
however, don't you think that
it would be in your best inter
sst to spend time improving
_pour companies than pointing
_^our fingers at a competitor?

Women's Basketball ends winning season
Dravis twins, Malloy lead team in 17-8 record

From Gettysburg College Press
Release There were two double
figure scorers and one
rebounder who stood as tall as
trees above the others. The
remainder of the wealth was
evenly distributed as the Get
tysburg College women's Bas
ketball team recorded its sev
enth winning season in the last
eight years.
The Bullets completed
the year with a 17-8 record and
finished in a tie for second
place in the west division of the
Cenntenial Conference with a
10-4 final tab.
The Bullets fought hard,
but lost a spot in the playoffs
when Western Maryland
handed them a 68-57 beating
in the tie-breaker contest.

Three of the most domi
nating players on the squad
were the Dravis sisters, Jen and
Stephanie, and junior Megan
Malloy. The twins, who were
each 5'6" and four year start
ers, acounted for 590 points
this season.
Steph averaged 13 points

per game and
Jen averaged
11.6. Jen also
had a 5.1 re
bound average,
to put herself
second on the
roster in that
category. Steph
and Malloy
were the vic
tims of injuries
during the te
dious season
which most
likely effected
their statistical
averages.
Steph
posted 966
carreer points
and the extra

two games
would have
given her an
oppurtunity to
join sister Jen in
the 1000 point
club. Jen com
pleted her ca-

Bullet sharpshooter Steph Dravis ended an illustrious college
career this season. She and her sister, Jen accounted for
2,014 points during the last four years.

reer with 1048 points placing
her fifth in the college's all time
scoring list. Malloy, not only
sustained an injury that kept

her out of three games, but was
late joining the team in pre-sea
son drills because of her stud
ies in Austrailia.

As it was,
Malloy domi
nated the
boards with
197 rebounds
for a 9.4 aver
age. With one
good season
remaining,
Malloy has
655 rebounds,
needing 251
more to break
the Gettysburg
record held by
Amy Hymes,
1992-96.
No less
than ten play
ers were given
starting assign
m e n t s

throughout the
year. Among
the leaders
were sopho
more Jamie
Dawson; se
nior captain

Beth O'Boyle, and sophomore
Megan McDonald. Dawson
finished the season with 114
rebounds for a 4.6 average and

scored 183 points. O'Boyle
turned in her best season with
122 points and 55 assists.
McDonald, a 6'0 forward, not
only rammed home 105 points
but accoutned for a team high
28 blocked shots and 36 steals.
Gettysburg averaged 4.6
three-pointers per game. The
Dravis twins evenly split 80 of
the team's 116 and O'Boyle
was third in line, landing 15 of
44. Dawson turned in the best
shooting percentage of 55 per
cent. Steph Dravis was the best
foul shooter, hitting 85 of 105
for 81 per cent. She also led
the team with 57 assists and sis
ter Jen topped the team with
49 steals.
While Gettysburg's over
all shooting improved and the
shooting margin was four
points better that the
oppostion, the Lady Bullets fell
two tenths per game behind the
opposition when it came to to
tal rebounding.

There were only five se
niors on this year's squad. Be
sides the Dravis twins and
O'Boyle, the only other senior
were Karen Albanesius, and
Katie Monahan.


Softball team combines experience with fresh talent

From Gettysburg Press Release
With three returning All
Centennial Conference players
and a veteran at all but two
postions, Gettysburg Head
Softball Coach Mike
Kirkpatrick is feeling pretty
good about his defense.
"We have a couple of po
sitions I would like to see a little
stronger," Kirkpatrick said, "
but overall we should be in
pretty good shape. All the m
fielders have strong arms and
excellent gloves. The outfield
ers have the same in addition
to good speed. As far as the
pitching is concerned, I have
never had this many pitchers,
but I don't have a dominating
performer."

Not only does
Kirkpatrick have ten letter win
ners in the fold, including seven

of his top eight hitters from last
year's 24-9 season, but "this is
one of the best freshman classes
tha I have ever had," he noted.
Freshman Alyson Adams
will play somewhere according
to Kirkpatrick. "She is that
good, that I could play her at
one of four positions: catcher,
first base, third base, or right
field," he continued. However,
when one looks over the re
turning talent, it is hard to fig
ure out who will be bumped.
For instance, All-Confer
ence first team Erin Killeen, is
back at first base, following a
.308 sophomore year, senior
Marybeth Korejko who batted
.340 last year returns to third,
and sophomore Karyn Miller
who started 31 of 33 games and
batted .333, is back behind the
plate. The two returning m-

fielders who have not felt the
pressure from the yearlings
have been senior Jill Murphy
at second base, and junior Sara
Gravehne, at shortstop.
"Right now they are
solid," Kirkpatrick said with a
smile. For the fourth straight
year, senior Traci Bullock will
be starting in right field. She
was a second team all-confer
ence selection last year as well
as an academic all-conference
with a 3.4 or better grade point
average. Bullock also lead the
team with a .400 batting aver
age in 1997.
However, the other two
outfield positions are up for
grabs. Two freshman who have
strong arms and exceptional
speed could move into the
starting spots are Jen White and
Casey Stevens. Veteran Jody

Noel is also a prime candidtate,
but she is also in the running
for the DH job. " When you
have a sub-three seconds run
ner to first base, you have to
have her in the lineup some
where," Kirkpatrick said of
Noel. Another freshman with
the same amount of speed is
Jess Rising.
J unior Angle Hoptak, still
rules as the number one hurler
on the squad. Two others per
formed well in the 1997: jun¬

ior Suzanne Daily, and
sopohomore Mehssa hazard,
(4-0). This staff will be sup
ported by two yearlings, Gracie
Stokes, and Katelynn Gorton.
Gettysburg leaves Satur
day ,March 7, for Ft. Myers,
Fla. where they will play seven
games begimng with St. John
Fisher College on Sunday,
March 8 at 4 p.m. The team's
first nothern engagement will
be a doubleheader at
Ehzabethown on March 18.

Florida here we come..

Baseball begins rigorous preseason training

by Ted Hartman
Sports Reporter

On Sunday March 8, the
Gettysburg Bullets will kick off
their 1998 baseball season with
a doubleheader against St. John
Fisher College and Washington
College, as part of a week long
stint in Cocoa, Florida.
Flying out of Baltimore
Washington International Air
port, the squad of twenty six
should reach their Ramada Inn
early Saturday morning. The
former site of the Houston
Astros will host this warm
stretch of games.
Though the Bullets will
be pitted against certain
Cennetenial Conference teams,
the Florida games will only
count for Gettysburg's overall
record and are considered non
league.

Coach John Campo is
definitely looking to come back
north with a number of victo
ries, however he has a number
of different objectives for this

trip. While the Bullets will ence play_,
eventually have a four-man starter to
pitching rotation, eight differ- want
ent men will take the mound —-

as starters over eleven con
tests. This should give
Campo an opportu- A
nity to solidify the _^ fl
roles of his J_^^M
pitchers with J_^^^^
regards to M _^^^^^
starting, _^^^^H
middle re- _^^^^^H_^
lief, and _^_K_^^_T
closing. _^^^^^ _S
Going to ^^^^^^^^
Florida, ^^^^^_ft
sophomores ^^^H
Paul Koether, and _^_B

Dan Sirpinski, and ^^_B
freshmen Tom Boob and ^^
Drew Chiesa fill the prob
able rotation.
"The Florida trip will
give us an opportunity to evalu¬

ate things and look at some
people. Given a chance, certain
guys may be able to redefine
their roles. Primarily, we are
trying to prepare for Confer-

h a s _^_BJ never
seen "_? playing time
at the Var- sity level," said
Campo.
PI McElroy was a prob-

If we were to lose a at
injury, I wouldn't
a guy in the <

who

able starter until hampered by
shoulder injury. Campo
hopes to give this sophomore
an opportunity to throw, if

only for a couple innings an
_^ outing. Juniors Matt

_^^^^ Rittenhouse and
_^^^^^ freshmen Pat Jor

_^^^^^^^_k likely all see

A_^^^_y Offensively,
_^H_^ the Bullets are confi
^^ dent the team will be
r able to plate baserunners
with the powerful sophomore
bats of Kevin Grimm, Bill
Beining, and John Woods. Bret
Thorpe has ability in his short
compact swing, and will start
at second base as a freshman.
The slate of teams
marked for the Bullets repre
sent a collection of solid pro
grams with traditional com¬

petitive records. Following
Sunday's double-header, Get
tysburg will play another two
games, taking on Ehzabethtown
in the morning and Clark that
afternoon. Tuesday's schedule
pits the Bullets against Case
Western and Ursinus.
Campo's squad has an off
day on Wednesday. The major
ity of the players will probably
go the beach. Some might visit
the nearby Marlins training
camp or spend the day at
DisneyWorld. However, the
Bullets havea 10:00 a.m. game
with Ehzabethtown again on
Thursday morning. Friday and
Saturday who will be playing
double headers for Gettysburg
playing at 10:00 and 1:00
against Susquehanna, Roches
ter, Wesley, and St. Lawrence.
After returning to Penn
sylvania a week from this Sun
day, the Bullets should be ready
to open their conference sea
son. On March 17 Gettysburg
will host Cenntenial Confer
ence foe Catholic at 3:15



Men's Lax prepare for run to NCAAs

by Henry Fawell
Sports Reporter
While most of the cam
pus is still waiting for winter
to melt away into spring, the
Gettysburg Men's Lacrosse
squad has beaten the heat and
gotten an early start on a sea
son packed with high hopes
and expectations. Despite the
new faces and changes, the '98
team will be measured by the
traditional rigorous standards
which have made the program
what it is today: a model of

excellence.
Coach Hank Janczyk en
ters his 11th season as head
coach for the Bullets. Last year
saw him not only win his 100th
game at Gettysburg, but also
become the winningest lacrosse
coach in the school's history.
Janczyk will be joined on the
sidelines by second year
coaches Jaime Steele, a former
Bullet captain, and Jack
Edwards. Dave Cornell, a two
time All-Amencan and '96 Get
tysburg graduate, has returned
to the program, as well.

The Bullets will be led
this year by four captains who
have proven, by the vote of
their peers, to be excellent lead
ers and motivators. Seniors
Andrew Edgerton, Scott
Lowery and Doug Sage will be
joined in their new positions by
Junior Brian Abott.
The Bullets will have to
replace several of last year's

seniors, who helped lead the
squad to an 11-5 record and an
appearance in the NCAA tour
nament semi-finals. The most
visible absences will be those of
Joe Feldman, Tom Valeo and
Brett Strait at midfield. All
Amencan James Gohng's de
parture leaves a void in the de
fense, as well.
Fortunately, last year's
role players are now well pre
pared to take the reigns in
1998. Midfielders such as Sage,
Mark Pollack, Rob Crowe Lee
Hemming, and Gregg Tebbe
will provide the bulk of the
scoring from their position,
with Crowe handling the ma
jority of the face-off duties.

Bullet lax players face-off in preseason training

Freshmen Pete Milhman and
Tommy Pierce have been im
pressive and will be tough to
overlook come game time.
Doug Cote, who's senior sea
son once appeared finished af
ter ankle surgery, is eying a
mid-season return which could
provide a big boost in scoring.
Janczyk can rely on both
talent and experience when it
comes to the attack. Seniors
Scott Lowery and Jamie
Bateman have seen significant
playing time their last two
years. Lowery's team-high 49
points in '97 earned him All
Conference and All-America
status. The third slot will likely
be filled by junior Ross

Garretson.
Defensively, the Bullets
return two of '97's three start
ers, including All-Conference
pick Brian Abbot. Abbot has
proved to be one of the most
talented and consistent players
on the roster, as he has started
every game in his two year ca
reer at Gettysburg. Senior Mike
McCram returns to the line-up
as well, hoping to pick up on
last season's pace which saw
him shut down a number of
opposing attackmen. Junior
Justin Domingos has shown
enough savvy and aggressive
ness in preseason to claim the
third spot in the starting line
up.

At defensive midfield,
Brian Rentschler and John Tay
lor, who both provide size and
solid stick checks, will see most
of the action.
Sophomore Andrew Bar
ter has firmly entrenched him
self in goal after last year's stel
lar freshman campaign. Barter
racked up 191 saves and a tow
ering 63.9 per cent save per
centage, while starting all six
teen games for the Bullets. His
most notable performance
came in the NCAA

quarterfinals when he piled up
21 saves in a 10-9 overtime win
over rival Salisbury State.
Thus, the faces may
change every spring, but the
talent and the expectations re
main high. This year, the Bul
lets will be gunning for their
eighth consecutive post-season
appearance under Janczyk, one
of the longest streaks in Divi
sion III. Their sights will also
be set on big games with an
nual powerhouses like Wash
ington &c Lee, Salisbury State
and Washington College.

"We need to treat every
game the same," said middle
Andrew Edgerton, "we didn't
do that last year and we barely
squeaked in the playoffs. But if
we play hard every game this
year we'll be in good shape."
Gettysburg opens the
1998 season this Saturday at
Musselman Stadium where
they square off against nation
ally ranked Roanoke College.


Richie Pfeil boosts Bullet's season

by Nikolaus T. Adams
Contributing Reporter/ B.A.S.S
Member Richard Pfeil, a sopho
more forward on the Bullets
basketball team, ended up 13
11— much improved over last
season's 7-17 record. Pfeil'_t
father introduced him to the

game of basketball in the third
grade. From then on, Pfeil
learned all the basics of the
game, until he went on to play
his high school ball at Thomas
Johnson High School in
Frederick, Maryland.
During Pfeil's Jun- _^^H
lor year (1995) at Tho-_^^
mas Johnson HighW J
School his team went all Ik I
the way to the state W" m
camphip,
up losing by one point. In 1
high school, Pfeil also partici
pated in varsity soccer and
track and field. In track and
field, his junior year, he went
to states for the high jump. The

following year, Pfeil's senior
year, he was the captain of the
varsity basketball team.
For this season,
Pfeil A
_^1 W

the Bullets jump out to a 5-0
start, which was similar to their
1996 start. This year the team

had installed a new offense,
which was a key factor in the
strong start. Right before
Christmas, the team took a turn
for the worse and ended up los
ing their last three games be
fore the break. After return
^. in g from their short
( . Christmas break, Pfeil
pulled his hamstring,
which sidelined him—and
his seven points and four re
^ bounds per game--for
_^ t hree games. His injuries,
_Q_^_k a long with several oth
m_^_B ers, accounted for the
¦Bullet's 1-3 record after
Christmas. The Bullets
did manage to regain their

form, and ended up winning
seven of their next nine games.
The team made a good run for
the conference playoffs, and
only needed to win their last
two games in order to make the
show. Unfortunately the team
lost those two games, which
ended the season.
The outlook for next
year's team looks good. The
team is losing two senior lead
ers, who will be hard to replace.
The core of the team is still in
tact though, and should be
strong for next season. Look
for Pfeil and the core of this
team to lead the Bullets to even
more wins next season.

False bomb threat paralyzes Glatfelter Hall
Horrible hoax has bounds hunting

by Keith Davis
Staff Reporter

Onlookers watch as Glatfelter Hall is closed during yesterday's phoney
bomb threat.

Glatfelter hall was the target of a
false bomb threat shortly before noon
yesterday, causing an immediate evacu
ation of the building.
Safety and Security and the
Gettysburg Borough Police immediately
responded to the computer generated
threat. Police barriers were put in place
and the building was closed off. A quali
fied bomb locating team from Frederick
Maryland brought in three K-9 units to
sweep the building in search of a bomb,
but only one dog was used to search
the premises. No explosive device was
found.
Director of Safety and Security
Operations Timon Linn was in charge
of the crime scene and is leading the
pending investigation.
It is not yet known who made the
threat or why but it has been established
that is was computer generated. The
threat has caused much frustration for
professors and students.
The building was completely
evacuated by 12 noon. Classes were
canceled for the afternoon and there

was uncertainty about when Glatfelter
would re-open. According to Linn the
plan was to sweep building and secur
ing its safety. At that point Glatfelter
was to be re-opened.
By 6:30 p.m., the building, one
of the oldest and most distinguished on
campus, reopened.
This threat was not the first bomb
threat in Gettysburg history, the most
recent being a threat made to Brua Hall
drung the 1994-1995 accademic year.
According- to Provost Dan
DeNicola, the threat did not make any
specific reference to any individual,

out explaining the situation and dispel
ling rumors.
DeNicola sent an announcement
stating: "this is, of course, a serious
matter even if it proves to be a hoax, as
we expect. Making a bomb threat cre
ates a significant disruption to the aca
demic life of the College; it is a viola
tion of the Student Conduct Code and
it is a serious crime under the Pennsyl
vania criminal statutes."
Denicola urged anyone with any
information concerning the identity of
the threatener to contact either Dean
Julie Ramsey or the Office of Safety and
Security.
Professor R.L. Patterson ex
pressed his frustrations about the situa
tion, "I think it is unproductive and
disruptive. This is a very serious threat...
they [the perpetrator] can spend some
time in the cross bar motel."
Patterson also mentioned the cost
and the inconvenience of having to pay
a qualified bomb team for their services.
Others had more safety concerns.

"If there were a bomb of some
consequence, you would have hoped
they would evacuate Mcreary, Penn
Hall, and White House," a student said.
The investigation into the com
puter generated threat continues.
Michael Martys, the Vice Provost for
Information Resources and Director of
Computing was consulted on the mat
ter. The college computer system has
the ability to track and monitor some
activity on the network. There is a lim
ited record of who logs onto certain

group, department, or cause. This fact "Once they get here; it's a big
corroborated the general feeling of the building," Linn said in reference to
administration and investigators that speculated times for re-opening_,
the threat was a hoax. Campus wide emails were sent

Peterson pleads guilty to manslaughter
Former student to testify against high school sweetheart

by Dan Larkin
News Editor
Former Gettysburg Col
lege student, Brian Peterson,
pleaded guilty to manslaughter
charges early last week, and
agreed to testify against his
high school sweetheart, Amy
Grossberg.
In October of 1996,
Peterson, a First Year Student,
and Grossberg, also a first year
student at the University of
Delaware, were accused of

murdering their newborn son
in a motel room in Delaware.
The officer of the medi
cal examiner stated that the
infant died of shaking, and
multiple skull fractures.
Two weeks ago,
Grossberg's attorneys asked for
a separate trial from Peterson,
and asked to introduce new
evidence blaming him for the
death of the infant.
Her attorneys claimed
that polygraph tests show that
Grossberg never saw the baby,

and thought that she had a mis
carriage. This claim, if true,
would place all criminal re
sponsibility on Peterson.
According to Peterson's
Lawyer, Russell Gioiella,
Peterson believed the infant to
be stillborn and put it in the
motel trash bin in a trash bag
per Grossberg's orders.
Gioiella told reporters
that "Brian has explained at
great length the infant didn't
show any signs of life." "Brian
had no intent to harm the baby
in any way," he said.
"Brian is not anyone's
adversary," Gioiella told re
porters, "He has a duty to tes
tify truthfully."
Peterson answered "yes,
sir," to J udge Henry duPont

Ridgely's question if he under
stood the consequences of his
guilty plea.
Grossberg's trial is cur
rently set for May 4.
The two students, both
19, are both white and from the
wealthy New Jersey suburb of
Wyckoff. The claim has been
made that the large amount of
attention given to the case has
to do with the teens' wealth
and race.
They have been living at
home with their families, moni
tored electronically. Both were
set free on $300,000 bail.
Grossberg's lawyer, Rob
ert Tanebaum said that he was
not surprised by the plea, and
claimed that "it doesn't change
our strategy at all."

Speaker to discuss
healing racism

GCPR Nathan Rutstein, an ac
claimed writer and advocate of
human rights issues, will come
to Gettysburg College on
Thursday, march 26, to offer a
lecture and workshop on
"Healing Racism." His presen
tation will begin at 11:30 a.m.
in the College union Building
and is open to the public free
of charge.
Rutstein's latest book,
"Racism: Unraveling the Fear,"
has been called a "brutally hon
est portrayal of racism that of
fers a solution and does no
leave us with hopelessness." He
is the author of 11 other books,
including "Healing Racism in
America: A Prescription for the
Disease In addition, Rutstein is

founder of the more than 200
North American chapters of
the Institutes for the Healing
of Racism. He has championed
ethnic diversity in higher edu
cation as a guest lecturer at col
leges around the country and
has produced ten films, includ
ing "Black and White in Spring
field, Massachusetts," and
"Finding a Solution."
In his speeches and
books, rutstein not only ex
poses racism's roots, its nature,
and how it affects humankind,
he also offers a workable solu
tion to a grave social challenge
that many people believe can
never be resolved. More than
just a prejudice, Rutstein sug
gests that racism is a form of
prejudice that has evolved into
an obsessive psychological dis
order that deeply arfects per
petrator and target alike.

Silly rabbit, cartoons aren't for kids!
Recent cartoons have become directed towards a more mature audience

by Cara Masucci
Staff Reporter It seems as though car
toons have become more and
more popular in mainstream
society. Cartoons have been
around for what seems like for
ever, but many things about
them have changed. Cartoons
are typically thought to be for
kids and to deal with issues
prevalent to childhood. Lately
though, this has changed dra
matically, and cartoons have

begun to move into adult tele
vision.
Most of us have fond rec
ollections of the cartoons we
watched after preschool or
when the babysitter was over.
Most people our age are famil
iar with Thunder Cats, The
Smurfs, and Scooby-Doo as
popular cartoon characters. As
time has progressed however,
these cartoons seem to set a
backdrop for several cartoons
that have become quite popu
lar in the last few years.

The Simpsons, South
Park, Dana, Beavis and Butt
head, and a whole slew of adult
directed cartoons have drawn
a cult-hke following from much
older age groups including the
important 18 to 34 category.
Part of this is due to the nature
of the material addressed in the
cartoons, which is linked to
older age groups because of
their ability to relate to it and
better understand it.
It appears as though the

dawning of what can affection
ately be called the Cartoon Era
got its start with Fox's show
The Simpsons. The Simpsons
is set in Springfield (state un
known) and offers a satirical
look into an American family
and the American way of life.
Its sarcastic qualities
drew unsupportive press when
the show first aired; critics had
problems with the under
achiever status of liart, the
family's son and major cult fig
ure of the early 90's. Many

parents felt that the subject
matter would have a bad influ
ence upon how their children
worked and behaved, particu
larly in the area of school.
According to avid watch
ers of the show, part of the rea
son the show is so funny is be
cause of the way in which it
mocks what are considered to
be American ideals of the
tough and hard-working. The

It's a '
fa r

cry from the older generation
of family shows like Leave It
to Beaver.
Despite the original ad
verse press, The Simpsons has
become quite popular among
all age groups, ranging from
pre-adolescents to college age
kids. Fox schedules the show
during prime time on Sunday
evenings at 8 o'clock, which is
considered one of the most
desirable time slots on televi
sion. It also shows re-runs a
couple of times a day.
A cult-hke following sur
rounds the show with many
people now displaying their
love for it through everything
from wearing Simpsons r-shirts
to thousands of web pages on
the Internet devoted solely to
the cartoon.
Since The Simpsons has

become popular, many other
networks have developed car
toons, following Fox's lead.
One particular network and
show is Cartoon Central's
South Park. Created a little over
half a year ago, South Park has
grown to cult status in what
seems like seconds.
Set in a small Colorado
town and starring four third
graders, the show deals with

older subject material in much
the same way as The Simpsons.
It plays on the stereotypes of
society in a very politically in
correct nature.
Everything from the dif
ficulties of dealing with parents
to the inability of lawmakers to
do their job is addressed in the
show. The kids, though vulgar
and crude, have an innocent
quality about them that allows
older viewers to relate to the
age group.
What is different about
South Park, in comparison to
The Simpsons, is that South Park
carries a TV-MA rating which
tells the viewer that the subject
material is of a mature nature
and deals with adult issues. The
mature subject matter does not
appear to dissuade young view
ers, according to an article in

Newsweek, which states that
23% of South Park viewers are
under 18.
The remaining percent
age of people watching South
Park help the undereighteen
category by contributing to the
5.2 million viewers that
watched South Park during
sweeps week. Like The
Simpsons, many web sites have
also been developed in homage

t o
South Park and i t s
char
a c -
ters.
A c -
cord
mgly,
t
shirt
sales
have
grosed
more than
$ 3 0
mil
lion dol
lars.

South Park is not immune
to controversy, though. Re
cently the show and its adult
subject matter have prompted
an elementary school in Can
ton, Georgia, to ban any t-slurts
or apparel worn with South
Park on them. The principal
who made the decision to pro
hibit South Park did so because
he felt it was unsuitable for el
ementary school students.
In fact, the creators of
South Park have even been as
serting that the show is not in
tended for that age group.
They have maintained this
point in stating that the show
airs at 10 o'clock, when parents
are around to monitor and dis
cuss inappropriate subjects.
For students at
Gettysburg College, the mature
rating of the show does not

seem to dissuade them. Almost
everyone questioned agreed
with first year student Matt
Griffin in how much they like
the show. Griffin even went on
to state that he is a devoted
watcher of both South Park and
The Simpsons.
First year student Liz
Bauerlein commented that
"[South Park] allows you to
laugh and have fun without in
volving much thinking." She
went on to state that sometimes
with her busy schedule she just
wants to kick back and relax
without the worry of what test
she has tomorrow. South Park
allows her to do this.
Most students asked on
campus rated their favorite car
toon to be The Simpsons. The
Sunday night slot allows one
more break before, having to
-crack down for a week of
studying.

Other popular cartoons
on campus range from MTV's
Dana to Scooby-Doo. Dana,
a cartoon that tells the story of
high school from a girl who
sees herself as constantly mis
understood and almost lost in
the world around her really hits
home for many people. Her
awkwardness makes her a char
acter one can relate to. Senior
Jaime Foanio even stated that
Dana is one cartoon she makes
time for in her busy schedule.
"It's one of the best cartoons
out there."
It seems that cartoons
grow more popular by the sec
ond. The large mass of car
toons aimed at older age
groups and material in child
hood cartoons that make it ap
pealing to the viewer makes
cartoons a booming industry
nationwide.

They allow a good time
and an escape from what can
seem like the monotony of
American life. For college stu
dents, especially those here at
Gettysburg, it offers a time to
relax from the pressures of aca
demic life.

extremely pleased with his re
cent performance in As Good
As It Gets, a wonderful and
charming romantic comedy.
Yeah, I can't remember
the last time I've enjoyed
Nicholson this much. Even his
more memorable roles in recent
years (Batman, A Few Good
Men) _jvere instances of Jack
playing himself. But here he
shines, allowing himself to de
velop a well-rounded character
who is equally crass and vulner
able. This movie stars
Nicholson (Wolf, The Two
Jakes) as Melvin Udall, an ob¬

sessive compulsive and best
selling author. Melvin is ob
sessed with cleanliness, avoids
stepping on cracks in the side
walk, and has to eat in the same
restaurant everyday. Melvin is
a bigoted, opinionated jerk.
This fire is fueled by the
fact that he lives across the hall
from Simon Bishop, a gay art
ist, played by Greg Kinnear
(Blankman, Talk Soup). Fur
ther compound this with Frank
Sachs, played by Cuba
Gooding Jr. (Lightning Jack,
Judgement Night) and one pid
dling but adorable dog and you
have a living hell for Melvin.
Melvin comes across as a
really mean guy, one who ev
eryone gives a wide berth to.
However, Carol, his regular
waitress at a coffee shop,
played by Helen Hunt
(Trancers II, Trancers III) tem
pers his behavior.

Inevitably, Melvin begins
to crack his rough exterior.
Nicholson is at his finest play
ing this tough character who
progressively thaws through¬

out the movie. * You actually
come to like Melvin. _However
the real stars of this movie are
Hunt and Kinnear.
Kinnear is believable as
the tortured artist who
struggles with trying to make
it. He has many tender mo
ments and the producers do a
good job avoiding making him
a stereotypical Hollywood gay
guy- Hunt turns in a really
believable and extremely allur
ing performance. She comes

across as motherly, caring, and
sexy all in one character. Hei
performance is one of the besl
I have see by a female in a lead
in a long time.
From "MadAbout You,"
it 's hard togague Helen Hunt's
acting ability, but she does a
much better job here than in
that silly tornado movie from
a few years back. I've given up
trying to resit the charms of ro
mantic comedies lately. They
just keep winning me over.
Hunt and Kinnear are great, but
Jack ' s the real star of the film.

It's worth seeing just for him.
This is a well acted and
well written story. As a viewer
I came to like all of the charac
ters and I was engaged
throughout the entire movie.
Go see this movie, take some
one with you, it's better than
Titanic ! I give this movie a
four and a half stars out of five.
Well, I'm one of the
eleven people on the planet who
hasn't seen Titanic, but, I'm
sure this is a much better movie.
What would you rather see:
Jack Nicholson in a witty ro
mantic comedy or Leonardo
DiCaprio on some dumb boat?
Four stars (out of five).
And for a bonus to all
you readers, my best picture
pick!!! If the voters have any
sense and don't vote for looks
but rather substance, they'll
vote Good Will Hunting best
picture.

Well, since neither Boogie
Nights nor the Fifth Element
were nominated, I suppose that
As Good as It Gets gets my re
luctant vote.

Sweet Home Alabama

by Eileen O'Donnell
Movie Columnist
What would you do if
you were on a plane with some
of the most notorious criminals
in the country? Most people
would hide in the overhead
compartment and wait it out,
but not Cameron Poe (Nicho
las Cage) in the movie Con Air.
This former Army ranger risks
his life to save the day. Now
how would a decorated war
hero wind up on a place full of
the worst of the worst?
After the Gulf War, Poe
returned home to Alabama. He
catches up with his wife Tricia
(Monica Potter) at a local bar
where she works as a waitress.
In trying to protect his lady's
honor, Poe gets into a brawl
with three of the regulars. He
kills one in self-defense with his
bare hands. On the advice of
his lawyer, Poe pleads guilty to
involuntary manslaughter. Be¬

cause of his ability to use deadly
force, he is sentenced to seven
to ten years in a federal peni
tentiary.
Throughout the prison
sequence, Poe reads and writes

touching letters to
Tricia and their
daughter Casey
(Landry Allbright),
who was born three
months after his in
carceration. While in
prison, Poe becomes
friends with Baby-O
(Mykelti Williamson
o(Heat). The movie
helps the audience's
sympathies to lie with

both Poe
and Baby-O. In a clever ploy
the nature of Baby-O's crime
is never revealed, but it is in
sinuated that he is expected to
be in prison for a long time.
This effectively causes the au
dience to see him as a good
prisoner, like Poe.
After eight years in

prison, Poe receives his parole
and is preparing to go back to
home, Alabama.
Meanwhile, US Marshall
Vince Larkin (John Cusack of
Grosse Point Blank) is readying

a new state-of-the-art prison
transportation plane for its
maiden voyage. This plane has
been designed to transport
criminals all over the country
for medical exams, prison
transfers, and to populate new
prisons. Larkin's main adver
sary on the ground is Duncan
Malloy (Colm Meaney of Star

Trek: The Next Generation), a
pompous DEA agent. He it
involved in this project because
his agency needs to get infor
mation from a notorious mob
ster before the FBI gets to him.
_^^_H Also aboard the
_i _^^^_f plane are Cyrus "The
_^^H Virus" Grisom (John
_i_^^^_H Malkovich), Diamond
^^H Dog (Ving Rhames), a
_^H crackhead named Pin
ball (Dave Chappelle),
_^H and a serial rapist
_^H called Johnny-23
_i _jj_^H (Danny Trejo). The
_^^^P banter between these
hardened criminals is
funny at times, and Grisom's
witty remarks are amusing.
Not long after the plane takes
off, a carefully planned hijack
ing occurs. The mastermind of
this takeover is, who else?,
Grisom. Malkovich is at his
best when he plays the crimi
nally insane, and in this film,
as with In the Line o f Fire, he is

able to accomplish just that.
He and his accomplices have an
ingenious plan to fly the plane
to freedom, but they did not
count on Cameron Poe.
After a stopover in
Carson City, Nevada, the ren
egade plane takes on ten new
prisoners ready for transfer, so
as not to arouse suspicion.
With this new group comes
Garland Greene, a serial killer
in the style of Hannibal
Lechter, played by Hollywood
freak Steve Buscemi (Fargo, The
Wedding Singer).
Con Air is an action
packed wild ride. Cage is a
great hero, Malkovich a bril
liant madman, and Cusack
plays a great straightman to
help Cage save the day. This
film, though extremely violent
and graphic, is funny. The
combination of wit, sarcasm,
action, and romance, coupled
with the excellent casting job,
makes this movie a must-see.




Help for the stressed out

by Christine Sedlacko and
Daniel Sirpenski
Contributing Reporters
Your reflection doesn't
look so perky in the mirror
anymore. The bags under your
eyes are darkening, your
roommate's music is just too
damn loud, your parents call
too often, and Servo seems re
ally bad this week. What is
your problem? This is called
stress. After spring break things
seem to speed up to the point
of unending work. Now we are
thrown into the last half of the
semester. You are not alone,
because most students on this
campus are experiencing the
same anxieties. Don't worry,
there are things you can do...

One thing to do is escape
to the land of beer and parties
and to get really drunk. Face
it, this only makes things
worse. You wake up Sunday
morning—er, afternoon—and
realize that you have two pa
pers to write, three tests to
take, and an eight o'clock the
next morning. So what can you
really do? The following are
some healthy and positive ways
to relax during these rough

mes. Try meditation. We don't
mean Zen Buddhism with
smoke, chanting, and circles.
Meditation is designed to relax
the mind and alleviate worries.
Dr. Herbert Benson at Harvard
University found that medita
tion leads to a relaxation re
sponse which reduces stress.
Here are three methods
of meditation that may be help
ful: 1) Breathing techniques.
Go to a quiet place, shut your
eyes, and focus on your breath
ing. Take two breaths and ex
hale slowly. Repeat.
2) Muscle relaxation.
Tense fists and hold for 15 sec
onds, and then relax slowly.
Stretch muscles before sitting
down to type a paper. Or take
turns with friends giving should

massages.
3) Visualization. Picture
yourself somewhere, maybe the
beach you visited over spring
break, or at home on your
couch (another place you may

have visited over spring break).
Let yourself go.
So, what do you get from
these forms of meditation? It
allows you time away from
worries. Remember, to relax,
you must take a passive attitude
and enjoy what happens
around you without worrying,
analyzing, or judging.
Open communication is
another way to get through
these stressful times and to just
relax. Sit around with some
friends without really doing
anything. Appreciate each
other's company and do not
feel pressured to do anything.

If you have a problem, talk it
through with a friend. Do not
bottle stressful things inside
because it will only make things
worse.
Once you've taken care
of the mental aspects, it's time
to work on the physical. Your
mom said it best: Eat your veg
etables, lay off the sweets, and
get plenty of rest. Food is your
body's fuel. You would not fill
your car up with soda and beer,
would you?
Now that you're eating
well, it's time to exercise. Jog,
play basketball, or lift weights,
anything to relieve tension and

stress. The exercise will keep Stress is taxing on the
you from tossing and turning body. It increases blood pres

Library BULLETin

by Libby Musseltnan
Library Columnist
Q: If I send for something
on Interlibrary Loan, am I
likely to get in it time to write
my paper?
A: It depends on when
you ask and when your paper
is due. Most book loans and
photocopies come in within a
week of request and can be
kept for three to four weeks
(photocopies, of course, are
yours forever). The catch is
that lending libraries are not
required to fill our requests.
So if your request is un
usual (like a thesis or an ob
scure journal), then we might
have to send off to a number
of schools before someone is
able to provide it, or the re
quest might not be filled at all.
Q: I have 100 things I
need on Interlibrary Loan. The
librarian told me that was too
many to ask for. Why?

When placing an interli
brary loan request, ask yourself
how much time you'll have to
read and analyze 100 articles
or books. When is the paper
due? What is a more reason
able number to read in the time
you have? Can you put your
requests in some priority—for
instance, which articles look
the best, which are longest and

might have the most details, do
they come from reputable
sources, etc.? Have you
checked with one of the refer
ence librarians to see what we
may actually own on your
topic? It is easy to fall into the
trap of taking the first 100
items that come up on a search
and ordering them all.
If you start with some
questions, you might find it is
more fruitful to pare down
your list. I mean, GET REAL
Nobody can read 100 items
and process all that informa
tion in a short time. In addi
tion, the average interlibrary
loan costs $30. We don't pass
those charges on to you, but
that's $30 that we don't spend
on something else in the library
Interlibrary loans are really
meant to supplement materials
we have right on hand.

Libbv's Tip of the Week:
Check the new feature on the
library homepage. Under
"What's New" access "New
Books." It will give a listing of
all the new books (and provide
a link to new videos) that have
come to the library in the last
week. Please send more of your
comments, questions, and/or
complaints to

I'll say it out
loud, Vma cynic
and proud

by Christina Dickert
Columnist Spring break is a time to
rest and reflect on the begin
ning of the new semester. My
first half turned out pretty
well, but something that a few
of my professors said to me
stuck out in my memory.
They accused me of being
cynical.
That got me to thinking
about that. Am I really all that
cynical? Do I really question
people's sincerity because I
constantly search for an ulte
rior motive behind their
words and actions?
Nah, it couldn't be true.
After seeing As Good As It
Gets, I knew that I wasn't that
neurotic. What do my pro
fessors know? They met me
in the middle of January and
by February, they are making
these assumptions about me.
I don't think so.

Well, I went straight to
the one person I knew would
be able to answer this ques
tion, the one person who has
known me all of my life— my
mother.
After all, she's my mom.
Moms aren't supposed to
have anything bad to say
about their children. I knew
she would give me the truth,
which is exactly what I
wanted to hear.
Well, maybe I shouldn't
have spoken with my mom.
Maybe she wasn't a good
source. I mean, she's just my
mom. She doesn't know what
I am thinking.
And to make matters
worse, she laid a mom-style
guilt trip on me— I don't
know what happened, but
you turned out to be one of

the most cynical people I know.
I didn't raise you that way. Wow
I love you too, Mom.
So, if she didn't raise me
that way, why am I so cynical?
Who made me this way? I
thought back to my childhood.
Did my twelve years of Catholic
education- socialize me to be
cynical of the world I live in? I
didn't remember any hidden
messages in my theology books
or any subliminal messages in the
hymns at Mass.
Then, I started thinking
that cynicism is biological.
Maybe cynics like me have a
chemical imbalance in our
brains that some yet-to-be-dis
covered medicine can cure and
let us lead optimistic, the-glass
ls-half-full lives. Then again,
maybe not.
Maybe it is the world
around me. With all the racism,
sexism, and basic hate in this
world, it is a wonder that every
one isn't a cynic.

It is difficult to recognize
who is sincere and who is not.
It's not me who is crazy; it's the
rest of the world.
People can get killed for
believing in the wrong God, be
ing a different race, or for sim
ply wearing the wrong color T
shirt down the street. Most of
the world's leaders have the abil
ity to end the world with the
press of a button.
So, is there really some
thing wrong with me or is there
something wrong with the world
that makes me question every
thing? After analyzing my deep
soul-searching, I don't think that
there is anything wrong with be
ing cynical. So, until this world
can (and does) change, I am just
going to have to be satisfied be
ing a cynical realist.

Shopping for president

by Libby Main
Political Columnist
Buying a swimsuit is a
chched traumatic experience.
Yanking on at least a dozen suits
in a 3x5 foot cubicle to find one
with the perfect size, cut, pat
tern, color, and label can seem
like the most exasperating of all
experiences. Is there anything
that compares to this frustrat
ing decision-making process?
Selecting the best presidential
candidate for the year 2000 is
going to be similarly over
whelming. Although few poli
ticians have officially declared
themselves in the race, there
are a few names that stand out
like the suits featured on de
partment store mannequins
and wall displays. Let's try few
of them on.

Texas Governor George
W Bush, son of former U.S.
President George H.W. Bush,
was polled as the candidate
most likely to win the Repub
lican nomination at the recent
Southern Republican Leader
ship Conference. Bush has
name recognition, a big state,
and personal connections to
wealthy donors on his side i
His weaknesses are a shoiJ
temper and a sharp tongue. /_J
40 he gave up drinking to try
to mitigate these shortcomings.
In terms of bathing suits, Bush
would be a suit with a quality
name but poor construction, a
DKNY that wears out in the
backside after sitting on the
edge of the pool a few times.

Another man of famous
paternity, Steve Forbes, also
seems eager to grab the Repub
lican nomination. Yet, this flat
tax obsessed millionaire is a
one issue candidate and a com
plete political outsider. Forbes
is like a John Paul Gautier suit
made out of an outlandish fab
ric that isn't functional or prac
tical.

A bathing suit in black
and red plaid flannel fabric
would be the signature of
Lamar Alexander, who often
wore a shirt of that print while
campaigning in 1996. This
former Tennessee Governor
and State Education Secretary
would be a grandmotherly cut
suit with a skirt because he
wants to hide his bulging
tummy—great personal wealth
he amassed through govern
ment connections.
Two rather lightweight
candidates, Jack
Kemp and
Dan ._^^^H_^_Mi
:„? _^^Ht

b e
able

bolster ^^^_M ^^
their im- ^^^^
ages enough to
be considered se
rious contenders. Kemp was
hurt by poor debate perfor
mance against Al Gore in 1996.
Dan Quayle is know for stupid
statements and his inability to
spell potato. Thus, he would be
a suit with a built in bust be
cause what he really needs are
intellectual push-up pads.
The Southern Republican

Leadership Conference en
dorsed Oklahoma Congress
man J.C. Watts as its top Vice
Presidential candidate. Watts,
who was elected in 1994,
preaches regularly and es
pouses family values. A convert
from the Democratic Party in
the early eighties, he is the
only African American
Republican in Con
gress. The Repub
licans would
put Watts . a

on the ticket for the
people who would buy a bikini
just for the sake of buying a bi
kini if you catch my drift.
Across the isle in the
Democratic section of
swimwear there are fewer
choices, however the candi
dates are very modern and
functional. Current Vice Presi
dent Al Gores suit is promi
nently displayed. As a former

C o n -
¥ gressman and
' Senator from Ten
nessee (1976
1992) who focused
on the issues of envi
ronmental conserva
tion and the advance
ment of technology
Gore has shown himself
to be a hard worker. As
a result, the Al Gore
model is a Speedo rac
ing suit in plain
black. Although
some people want a
I flashier, more me
dia savvy presi
dent they

_^^_A should
_^^^ remember that
black is classic
and flattering
on everyone.
House of Representatives
Minority Leader Richard
Gephardt has championed the
issues of healthcare, trade and
tax fairness since his freshman
year in Congress. Know as a
combination of a fiery populist
and a back-room pragmatist,
Gephardt has shifted his views
on abortion and gay rights to

the left in recent years. In light
of this newer, more hip image
a halter top swimsuit with
spandex short bottoms would
fit him well.
Champion of govern
ment-funded health care, en
titlements and Social Security,
Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey
is considering a second presi
dential run. This highly
decorated Vietnam vet
eran and chair of the
_^^ Democratic Senatorial
_^_ftfe Campaign Committee
_^fl 1 has been know to be
_^_Bh dangerouslcandid.
_^^_T The best suit to de
scribe him would be a

thong which exposes more
than you want to see.
Just as new swimsuit
styles are sometimes released
late in the season, more candi
dates may prove to be impor
tant contenders in the presiden
tial race of 2000. Reviewing
the candidates early and learn
ing as much as you can about
them helps make sure you
make the best choice. Nobody
wants to take a swimsuit home
and discover that the front gaps
when you sit down. Thus,
bending over and taking a look
at the candidates from every
angle prevents you from regret
ting your decision at the ballot

This article was my at
tempt to write about politics in
a more lighthearted way in the
hopes that it will be read by a
more diverse and larger audi
ence. Becoming politically in
formed is neither painful or
tedious. Internet resources can
be helpful, as can contempo
rary magazines such as George
; useful information is not lim
ited to C-SPAN and The New
York Times. As college stu
dents, we should all try our best
to know what is happening in
Washington—it affects all
Americans.

Congratulations to all
new members of the 11 fra
ternities and five sororities on
campus! Pledging is finally
over and now we can all get
some rest and focus on the
end of the school year. For
now, the Interfraternity
Council (IFC) is very busy.
This Saturday over four
fraternities will be engaged in
a philanthropy at a homeless
shelter on North Stratton
Street. We will be helping to
renovate a house for a fam
ily. This is the first of four
philanthropic events this se
mester for IFC. We hope to
have great participation and
fun. Sigma Alpha Epsilon
and Gamma Phi Beta coop
erated in holding the second
annual Singled Out event this
past Wednesday which, like

last year, was a great time for
all. Get psyched again be
cause Greek Week is coming
this semester. More details will
follow in other editions of the
"Greek Word" detailing the
events planned.
This year's Greek Week
chairs, Thomas Sansone and
Erika Beernik_, would like to
take the opportunity to inform
everyone as to why Greek
Week will be held in the Spring
this year.
"Many of you are prob
ably wondering why Greek
Week is in the Spring or you
might have no idea what is go
ing on. Well, the answer can
be simplified to one word -
participation. In the past,
Greek Week was a thriving
event, one that people looked
forward to."
"However, last semester
it was difficult to get someone
to come to an event as it is get
ting someone to the dentist.
Greek Week is meant to be a

time to show how proud you
are to be a member of the
Greek Community. It gives
everyone a chance to bond with
their fraternity and sorority.
There is even the element of the
good, healthy competition be
tween organizations. The in
creased numbers in all of the
fraternities ad sororities will
hopefully increase participa
tion." "Since the nice weather
usually increases morale on
campus, we hope that more
people will come outside and
have fun at all of the events that
are planned. Without the in
creased support of every orga
nization, Greek Week will not
be as enjoyable and successful
as it has the ability to be."

One final note to the
campus community: the all
sorority GPA was higher than
any other campus
organization's GPA, as well as
higher than the all campus
GPA. Looks like partying is not
the prime object of our organi
zations.


Consider this

Emailing a bomb threat
to get out of class? Is this the
latest method of procrastina
tion, or has there been a no
table shift in the ethical values
of students?
Though it has not been
proven that the threat came
from a student, it cannot be
ignored that there has been a
marked increase in the amount
and nature of the crimes on
campus.
Just look at the crime
stats for this semester...in ad
dition to the inevitable liquor
law violations, there have been
numerous reports of criminal
activities in the form of van
dalism, break-ins, theft, voy
eurism, and suspicious activity.
Though unpleasant for the vic
tims, these incidents have been
somewhat isolated: most stu
dents were probably informed
only by reading about them in
the newspaper.

Wednesday's bomb scare
threatened the entire campus,
but was anyone truly fright
ened? It seemed that students
cared more that class was can
celed than that one of the most
beautiful, historically rich, and
widely used buildings on cam
pus could have been destroyed,
not to mention the fact that
they themselves and other
buildings could have been

damaged.
Maybe it is a natural hu
man response to try to laugh
in the face of danger (there are
what, 800 psychology majors
on campus--any thoughts?
Anyone? Anyone? Bueller?),
but even though it may have
been a joke, it is quite illustra
tive of the "not me" syndrome
that is becoming more and
more prevalent in society to
day, especially on this campus.
We must be pretty lucky
to live in a place where a bomb
threat is not even remotely
frightening. Some people,
even in this country, face the
real threat of danger every day
of their lives.
It is doubtful that many
individuals on campus paused
during their unexpected hours
of freedom to consider the fact
that the lives of numerous
people could have been endan
gered had there actually been
a bomb.

What does it say about
this campus that people care
more about having an extra
hour of spare time than the loss
of an integral part of Gettys
burg College's heritage?
Wednesday was a sad day
for Gettysburg College. The
reaction of the campus was a
poor reflection on the way we
live flnH think.

Pleased parents
To the editor:

column was by staff writer
Henry Fawell in the previous
week 's issue. Mr. Fawell dis
cussed some fundamental dif
ficulties he had had with what
he regarded as the unfairly nar
row focus of two of his profes
sors on the stated subject mat
ter of their sections of mult-sec
tioned courses. Mr. Fawell
proposed a solution designed
to limit impingement of aca
demic freedom at the same
time that it gives the prospec
tive student advanced warning
of the tact that the instructor
intends to coverthe subject
matter of the course in a non
traditional way.
I happen to share the be
lief of John Dunlap as to one
of the two professors he lauded

As the parent of a student

at the College, I am writing to
let you know how much my
wife and I appreciate your
newspaper both for its factual
reporting of campus events and
for the opinions expressed in
its column and editorials.
We were especially im
pressed with two recent opin
ion columns which addressed
teaching at the College. One
of the columns was by regular
columnist John Dunlap and
appeared in your February 19th
issue. The column contained a
thoughtful tribute to two of
Mr. Dunlap'_s professors who
were denied tenure. The trib
ute was part of a discussion of
student input to important de
cisions on campus. The other
\ 1 i
''' _N
ls

who was denied tenure that the
decision was an unfortunate
one for the College causing it
to lose a great teacher in an
important discipline. (As to the
other professor Mr. Dunlap
mentions, I simply don't know
him.) My point, though, is that
whether one agrees or disagrees
with the positions expressed in
these two columns, it is good
to see a college newspaper car
rying such commentary on is
sues central to the life of the
College.
We will continue to read
your paper with great interest.
Sincerely,
Stephen M. Hudspeth

Nathan Rutstein, "Healing Racism "
What is racism and how does it
impact us as individuals, in our
communities and in our society? In
his speeches and books, acclaimed
human rights author Nathan Rutstein
not only exposes racism's roots, it's
nature and how it affects us all, he
also offers a workable solution to a
grave social challenge that many
people believe can never be resolved.
More than just a prejudice, Rutstein
suggests that racism is a form of
prejudice that has evolved into an
obsessive psychological disorder that
deeply affects perpetrator and target
alike. Hailed as "a brutally honest
portrayal of racism that offers a
solution and does not leave us with

Daly leads young lady laxsters; Florida trip key

From Gettysburg pi ess _ic lease
In five seasons Bullets la
crosse coach Carol Daly has
compiledd a 44-31 record. In
1995 and 1997, she guided her
teams to the Eastern College
Athletic Conference Division
III Mid-Atlantic playoffs; in
1995 the Bullets defeated
Franklin 8c Marshall, 8-6 in the
title game.
Daly graduated from
Gettysburg in 1983 with a de
gree in Health and Physical
Education. Prior to returning
to Gettysburg as a coach Daly
was the head field hockey and
women's lacrosse coach at Ply
mouth State College in New
Hampshire.
This year coach Daly will
reload with some serious talent.

Bullet veteran Chrissy Nordoff looks to dish off to a teammate.
Nordoff's leadership is a necessity for the young Lady Bullet
squad.

With a few veterans missing from the roster, young Bullets must mature quickly

can career. Last year, Sullivan
third team All-American hon
ors for her defensive
performace. Though stopping
opponents was her specialty,
"Sully" also scored 21 goals
and had five assists to provide
some offensive support.
Chrissy Nordoff, Sharon
Coghan and Heather
Donaldson, and Lisa Beideman
will also be significant con
tributors as they led and let
tered on this Bullets team a year
ago. Nordoff started all 17
games last year for the team,
and finsihed up with 32 goals
and 11 assists on the season.
Her most important effort was
a six-goal output in a 16-8 win
over Muhlenberg a year ago.
Donaldson, who ap
peared in 19 games her first
two years at Gettysburg missed

the 1997 campaign while
studying of-campus. As the
team's goalie, Donaldson had
a .563 save percentage as a
sophomore.
This year a tight Bullets
unit will attempt to uphold all
the preseason expectations for
such a young team. With all
that maturing talent there is no
telling how far this Bullets team
can go.
A tough Florida trip with
lots of hard work was very pro
ductive for a young team that
needs to play together, and gel
as a unit. The age, and experi
ence that the Bullets do have,
will have to show the young
laxsters what it takes to win on

such a competitive level. The!
Lady Bullets next gam coming
up soon and these tough ladies
need you support so come out
and watch a game.

Geared up and ready, the Bullets Lacrosse team prepares for their game'with top-ranked and perennial powerhouse, Roanoke College, before Spring Break.

Henry Fawell
Staff Writer

In the past ten days the
Gettysburg men's lacrosse team
has learned the true definition
of working overtime, as it took
five extra periods of play to
decide the outcome of the
squad's first two contests.
With their record stand
ing at 1-1, the number eight
ranked Bullets have now gained
crucial overtime experience
that could help them down the
road against high profile oppo
nents. On March 7, Gettysburg
played host to number six
ranked Roanoke College, a
team the Bullets beat in the sea
son opener one year ago.
Like Gettysburg, the Ma
roons are consistently ranked
in the top 10 and can provide
fit competition for any team in
the nation. They did just that
on Saturday by dragging the
Bullets into three overtime pe
riods before succumbing to the
Gettysburg offensive attack.

Throughout the contest,
the Bullets relied on their usual
strongpoints-fast-break open
ings, face-off play, and tough
goaltending. Sophomore Mark

while Milliman tallied three,
including the game-winner in
triple overtime which ended
the contest at 10-9.
This past Sunday the
team travelled to Lexington,
VA_, looking to knock off num
ber 11 Washington 8c Lee, their
second straight nationally
ranked opponent.
The Bullets started off
slow in the first period, but
opened the flood gates the sec
ond quarter by scoring five of
the team's seven goals.

Junior attackman Ross
Garretson spearheaded the bar
rage, weaving through the
W&L defense and dumping in
four goals.
Milliman and senior

Scott Lowery tallied a goal a
piece, as did junior middle Rob
Crowe, who also provided
tough defense and solid face
off work.
Freshman Mike Plantholt
delivered a fine defensive effort
by shutting down W&L's top
scorer throughout the second
half. But the second half
proved to be teh Bullets' down
fall, as the offense lost all mo
mentum and was held scoreless
the rest of the game.
"No one could get it in
the net the second half," said
midfielder Lee Hemming.
"Our defense played well and
we just blew it on the offensive
side." Gettysburg's problems,
however, were just beginning.
While they managed to sneak
into overtime at 7-7, critical
mistakes plagued the Bullets on
both sides of the field.

Clearing opportunities
broke down on defense and the
offense failed to regenerate the
first half's momentum. Finally,
in the second overtime period,
W&L struck one final time,
sending Gettysburg home with
an 8-7 loss.
With a number of top-

ranked teams still left on their
schedule, the Bullets can use
the overtime experience to
their advantage.
Last year, Gettysburg
went into overtime on three
separate occasions, including a
double-overtime victory over
number one ranked Salisbury
Sate. However, as junior

attackman Pat Pendergast said,
"We'd much rather win these
games quickly and decisively.
We don't need any more dra
matics."
The Bullets won deci
sively this Tuesday by pound
ing Wooster 23-2 and will look
to improve to 3-1 this Saturday
as they host Amherst.

Young Bullet batsmen showing that they are the real deal

by Ted Hartman
Staff Reporter The Bullets Baseball
team returned to Gettysburg
last Sunday from a very im
pressive week long stint in
Cocoa, Florida. Beating the
Ikes of defending Mid-Atlan
tic Conference champion
Ehzabethtown, the squad tal
lied eight wins, and lost just
three games. The Bullets _inv
proved to 9-3 on Tuesday
with a victory over Catholic
in the team's home opener.
Head Coach John
Campo credits the Bullets'
pitching for the early suc
cesses. The staff as a whole
pitched seven complete
games, appearing particu
larly prepared for this early
in the season.

SophomorePaul
Koether had two excellent
performances in Florida and
proved to be a huge asset in
relief against Catholic, while
fellow sophomore Dan
Sirpinski threw well in his
second outing. For the un
derclassmen, freshmen Pat

Jordan, Tom Boob, Drew Chiasa,
and Jeff Ellis pitched extremely
well in their first collegiate out
ings, was Jordan hurling a one
hitter. With the stretch of non
conference games coming to a
close Campo is beggining is to
narrow his pitching rotation.
Sirpinski, Boob, Jordan, Chiasa,
Ellis, and Koether are potential
starters on Campo's day-to-day
approach with his staff.
Juniors Matt DeVecchi and
Pete R-ttenhouse will primarily
throw in middle relief and should
be joined by two others once the
four-man rotation is finalized.
Gettysburg's closer is
sophomore P.J. McElroy, who
would currently be vying for a
starting position if not for a ham
pering injury. However, Campo
expects McElroy to effectively
seat opposing batsmen in finish
ing Bullet wins, as he also had
an impressive southern trip.

ing coach Lee Rentzell for do
ing an outstanding job with the
staff," said Campo.
Offensively, Gettysburg
hit .325 with considerable sup
port from the bat of John
Woods. The Bullets' first
baseman hit an incredible .513,
smacking two home runs and
plating 13 teammates. His hit
ting prowess guaranteed the
sophomore the title of Centen
nial Conference player of the
week. The play in Cocoa al
lowed Campo to solidify his
lineup, clearing up certain
questions about the order.
The Bullets tablesetters

include Daryl Clancy as lead
off hitter and either Bill
Neston or Greg Kosc in the
two slot. While Clancy should
start all season in left, Kosc and
Neston each represent poten
tial right-fielders. As the sea
son progresses, the two play
ers will either platoon the po
sition or one will emerge as the
everyday choice.
As expected, third
baseman Kevin Grimm,
Woods, and designated hitter
Bill Beining constitute the
heart of the Bullets' order.
Second baseman Bret
Thorpe hits sixth, with either
Jack Tanner or Ken

Rittenhouse batting seventh,
depending on who is catching.
Centerfielder Chris Lunardi
and second baseman Brett
Thorpe complete the lineup,
and provide late order speed.
The scheduled double
header against Juniata was can
celed for Wednesday March 18.
One game will be rescheduled
for the March 27, sandwiched
in between Messiah on Wednes
day, March 25 and a double
header against Ursinus the fol
lowing Saturday. The squad
will play two against Muhlen
burg this Saturday, March 21,
in what will be their first Cen
tennial Conference games.

"I knew our young pitchers
had the potential to throw well.
However, I didn't expect them to
come through so well at this point
of the season; to be this ready. I
give a lot of credit to our pitch-

Bob Dole will speak in the ballroom of the CUB on April 13 at 7:30 p.m.

by Laura Root
Staff Reporter Former US Senator, Senate
Majority Leader, and 1996 presi
dential candidate Bob Dole will
provide a free lecture open to the
public on Monday, April 13, at
7:30 pm in the CUB Ballroom.
Dole is the 1995 recipient
of the Eisenhower Leadership
Prize. The award was presented
to him by Gettysburg College and
its affiliate, the Eisenhower World
Affairs Institute in Washington,

D.C. The Eisenhower Leader
ship Prize is an annual award
which publicly recognizes a leader
who is influential in national and
international affairs and honors
a person whose lifetime accom
plishments reflect Dwight D.
Eisenhower's legacy of integrity
and leadership.
Other recipients include Lt.
Gen. Brent Showcroft, Gen.
Colin Powell, former Secretary of
the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen,
former US president George
Bush, and international human
rights advocate and Nobel Prize
laureate Elie Wiesel.
It is understood that all re
cipients of the award will even
tually come and speak at
Gettysburg.

Born in Russell, Kansas,
Dole has a distinguished carreer
of public service that spans'half a
century. Serving as a platoon
leader in the Tenth Mountain Di
vision in Italy, Dole was wounded
and decorated for his service in
combat in World War II. His
decorations include two Purple
Hearts and a Bronze Star with
Oak Leaf Cluster.

"GRAB" a chance at adventure
see page 6

He has had nearly unparal
leled experience in the American
political arena.
Dole has served as a county
attorney, a state legislator, Chair
man of the Republican Party, a
member of the House of Repre
sentatives, the Republican nomi
nee for Vice President, Chairman
of the Senate Finance Committee,
Senate Majority Leader, and a
candidate for President.
Dole retired from politics in
1996 after being defeated by Bill
Clinton in the Presidential Elec¬

tion. President Ronald Reagan
has said of Dole that "his title of
Leader is not just a job title, it's a
description of the man."
Dole's effectiveness as con
sensus-builder and his commit
ment to deficit reduction and eco
nomic growth have earned him
accolades from his peers — Re
publicans, Independents, and
Democrats alike.
Dole is currently married to
Elizabeth Hanford Dole, Presi
dent of the American Red Cross.
He has one daughter, Robin.
The plans for Dole's visit
were just finalized over Spring
Break. Dole will privately meet
with a group of several hundred
specially invited students on the
afternoon of April 13. Specially
invited students will also attend a
dinner with him. The public ad
dress will be given at 7:30 that
evening.

Dole's lecture is untitled as
of yet. It is expected that he will
speak on the world of federal poli
tics and federal government with
an emphasis on leadership.

Acclaimed short story writer to speak tonight

by Daniel Larkin
News _Editoi
Short story writer and
novelist Judy Bidnitz will read
from her writings tonight at the
Junction in the College Union
Building, at 8:00 p.m.
Bidnitz's debut collection
of short stories, Flying Leap,
met with much critical acclaim
when it debuted in January.
J.D. Biersdorfer, in The
New York Times Book Review,
writes: "Budnitz takes highly
imaginative leaps of faith and
logic in 23 stories about love,
despair, escape and hope. And
she doesn't look down."
Rachel Cusk of the Vil
lage Voice comments "Budnitz's
humorous and original story
ideas and the bold strokes with
which she delineates them are
the indispensable allies of her
lyric intelligence. They are
what makes Flying Leap an in
triguing and mature debut."
Newsweek says "There's

no filler and none of
those pretentious
stories about "real
life" where nothing
happens but we're
all supposed to pre
tend that something
did... Here is a col
lection that makes
good on the hype. .
. I don't know what
planet Budnitz
comes from, but I'm
happy to have her."
Kirkus Re
views calls it "Im
pressing by its au
dacity and original¬

ity ... Budnitz s j ucjy Budnitz will speak in the Junction tonight. f.i8photo
wry, conversational

tone is mcely leavened by pre
cise lyrical passages . . .
mordantl funny."
Compared with Margaret
Atwood, Paul Rudnick and
Shirely Jackson, Bidnintz tells
stories with a wide range of
topics. These include "Dog
Days," a tale of a man in a dog
suit in post-apocalyptic

America, "Got Spirit," about
cheerleaders so caught up in
school spirit that they set them
selves on fire for a football rally,
and "Guilt," a story of a son
convinced to donate his heart
to his dying mother.
Budnitz, 24, grew up in
Atlanta, and graduated magna
cum laude from Harvard. She

is now earning her Masters' de
gree from the NYU Creative
Writing Program.
In addition to her writ
ing, she is currently a cartoon
ist for the Village Voice, and has
drawn and produced an ani
mated film, "Hershel."
Budnitz's reading is spon
sored by the Writing House.

woman is the first Gettysburg
student they meet. This is be
cause this year, twenty-eight
Greek women have served as
Orientation Leaders, twenty
seven sorority women are cam
pus hosts, and twenty are tour

guides.
Last semester, the Greek
women's composite GPA was
3.043 while the non Greek
women's composite GPA was
2.939 and the all women's GPA
was 2.967.
The women dressed in
black to protest what they con¬

sider to be the prevailing atti
tude on campus, which is, that
Greek women are uninterested
in activities outside of their so
rorities. By doing so, Greek
women hoped to show that
they contribute a lot of time,
energy and leadership to many
aspects of Gettysburg College.

Take a GRAB at outdoor opportunities

by Erin Howe
Staff Reporter "You can learn more in
one hour of play than in a
whole day of conversation." -
Plato The Gettysburg Recre
ational Adventure Board
(GRAB) provides experiential
education opportunities to the
Gettysburg College campus
community. The overall mis
sion of GRAB is to provide an
environment which fosters per
sonal development and respect
for individual differences
through adventure-based ac
tivities, such as backpacking,
rock climbing, caving, and
leadership seminars. GRAB
creates an understanding of
safety procedures for trip suc
cess and recognizes that having
fun is still one of the top pri
orities. GRAB has sponsored
more than 25 trips this year.

In the past month alone,
there have been trips to North
Carolina, West Virginia, Vir
ginia, and Maryland. During
spring break, GRAB sponsored
a 63-mile backpacking trip to
the highest peak in Virginia,
Mt. Rogers.
First year student Kate
Welton described her experi
ence on the spring break trip
as "absolutely amazing" be
cause "you have the opportu
nity to do things you would
never think you would be able
to do, and can reach beyond

your own expectations in a re
ally positive atmosphere."
While the trip to Mt.
Rogers was lead by Paul
Hutchinson, Mark Rostafin_,
and Poppy Goforth, the new
GRAB facilitators went to Cold
Mountain, North Carolina,
where they experienced freez
ing temperatures, waist-high
snow, high winds, and torren
tial downpours during the Wil
derness Institute.
The Institute is an inten
sive week-long introduction to
trip and group facilitation.
Through workshops and dis¬

cussions during the training,
staff members get firsthand ex
perience in technical skills and
leadership development. The
staff is challenged on their per
sonal vs. professional facilita
tion styles, such as understand
ing gender and diversity issues.
Additionally, through spending
so much time together in this

kind of setting, the staff come
to rely on each other, and on
each other's judgement.
The second half of the
week was spent at Stone Moun
tain, North Carolina, where the
staff learned about rock-site
management, anchor and
rappel systems, and vertical
rock rescue techniques. Facili
tators concluded their week
with a 4-pitch, 675 ft. climb
and rappel on the face of the
rock. The week was a great
chance to strengthen leadership
skills and build group unity.
"Through these challenging
adventures and activities, we
benefitted from each other's
strengths and weaknesses as
individuals and as a whole

group," said first year facilita
tor Becca Sargent.
GRAB was developed and
created in the spring of 1996
by John Regentin, with the sup
port of President Haaland and
Dean Ramsey, recognized the
assets of what an experiential
education program could offer
the campus community.

GRAB is composed of 26
student facilitators who have
experience in a variety of out
door areas. All facilitators re
ceive training in backcountry
skills, wilderness medicine, and
expedition ethics by Regentin,
Alan Baker, and Dr. Gary
Nussbaum, Chair of the Leisure
Services Department at
Radford University.
The facilitators are also
dedicated to two central phi
losophies, the Full Value Con
tract and Challenge by Choice,
which emphasize the necessity
to uphold safety standards and
to respect yourself and the
group. Many Gettysburg stu
dents may have been exposed
to these two teachings while
participating in ropes course

activities. Essential to the func
tion of GRAB, these philoso
phies are necessary in that they
provide a framework for the
emotional and physical safety
of all the participants of any
GRAB sponsored activity and
therefore are never subject to
compromise.
The Full Value Contract

is the component of the GRAB
philosophy that allows both
participants and staff to get the
most out of their experience
and to define and achieve their
goals. The contract is an oral
or written statement guarantee
ing individual respect in a
group setting. Its purpose is to
stimulate each member to think
about their own role in the
group and to push themselves
to their own limits, while be
ing safe in the process.
While encouragement
from the Full Value Contract
allows groups to work together
and provide productive feed
back, the Challenge by Choice
element of the GRAB program
encourages participants to "try
potentially difficult and/or

frightening challenges in an at
mosphere of support and car
ing." In other words, anyone
has opportunity to back off and
say "I'm not sure I want to try
this," and their decision will be
supported by the group.
Casey Jaykus, who re
cently went on a caving trip,
appreciated the atmosphere
created by these philosophies.
"The staff was really support
ive and I didn't feel forced to
challenge myself more than I
wanted to."
Many students are intro
duced to GRAB through AS
CENT trips offered to first year
students. According to Welton,
the ASCENT trips "allow in
coming students a chance to get
to know other people even be
fore Orientation." Led by
GRAB facilitators, the trips ad
dress issues and questions
which concern incoming stu
dents about academic and so
cial expectations at Gettysburg
College.

GRAB also offers pro
grams for the communty. They
have a partnership with a Bal
timore high school, and some
of the male staff work with an
agency to start an adolescent
male involvement program.
As for the campus, GRAB
welcomes all students, staff,
and faculty to join them, re
gardless of experience level.
First year student Kate Cosseo
explains, "Outside, you can
learn more about yourself than
you could ever imagine."

Reel Hits & Misses

Marshals , Marshals , Marshals

by Dan Larkin and Mike Petro
Movie Columnists
Okay, how many people
out there didn't see The Fugi
tive? Well, those of you who
didn't see that classic summer
movie featuring Tommy Lee
Jones and Harrison Ford, you
are in for a surprise with U.S.
Marshals. For the millions of
you who did see the first install
ment, well, you won't be sur
prised by the premise of this
quasi-sequel.
The Fugitive was one of
the first of the classic TV-to-sil
ver screen films that swamped
the box office in the early nine
ties. It's also one of the best
(though with competition like
The Beverly Hillbillies and A
Very Brady Sequel . . . ). But
just when the glut of television
inspired movies seems to have
passed, we get this oddball.

Spinning the minor char
acters of a successful movie re
make of an old television show
into their own feature presen
tation may even be a first for
Hollywood, an attempt to lure
audiences on recognition ap
peal. "I've seen that before, it
must be good." (What's next,
Alice, the Bradys' maid in her
own feature film? )
Here goes. Picture a
man, Mark Sheridan, a former
CIA operative, framed for mur
der. He is arrested and placed
on a plane bound for a federal
penitentiary. The plane goes

through a spectacular crash
landing and Sheridan goes run
ning. Unfortunately for him,
U.S. Deputy Marshal Samuel
Gerard, a man with blood
hound instincts and the same
weathered looks (just kidding,
Tommy), is on his trail.
Sheridan, with the search
teams in hot pursuit must seek
to clear his name and get his
life back. Wesley Snipes
{Money Train, The Fan), plays
the hunted, Tommy Lee Jones
(Volcano, The Package) re
prises his Academy Award win
ning role, and they are joined
by the same supporting cast
members, the most notable be
ing Cosmo, played by the very
likeable Joe Pantoliano
(Congo, Calendar Girl).
The main appeal of The
Fugitive was the character of
Richard Kimball, played by
Harrison Ford. We believed in

his character, and wanted him
to escape. Snipes' portrayal of
Sheridan doesn't elicit the same
sort of sympathy that Ford did.
This is not due to Snipes' short
comings as an actor as much as
to the amount of screen time
that he is given. Where Ford
and Jones received equitable
amounts of screen time in The
Fugitive, U.S. Marshals is
clearly Jones' movie.
Jones does a respectable
job playing Gerard again, but
without the "Valjean -Javert"
style relationship of the origi
nal, his character is not as ex¬

citing . He won't be winning
any Oscars this time around.
The chemistry between
Jones and his fellow marshals,
however, is nicely portrayed
and probably the best part of
the movie. I'm sure they'll all
be back for another sequel in no
time. Maybe next time they'll
get to chase somebody who ac
tually did something wrong.
The team is joined by an
FBI counter-terrorist specialist,
John Royce, played by Robert
Downey, Jr. (Air America,
Heart and Souls) and proceeds
on a cross country search. You
don't need me to tell you all of
the near misses and deceptions
which twist the plot of this
movie, especially if you saw the
first.

Dustin Hoffman, in a re
cent interview, called Robert
Downey Jr., "the most gifted
actor of his generation." I'd be
more inclined to agree with him
if Downey didn't do stuff like
this. His character is never fully
developed and his performance
is rather uninspired. This is a
real waste of talent.
I was not overly im
pressed with this movie. It was
not as funny, nor engaging, as
its predecessor. However, I did
find myself enjoying the two
hours I spent with it. For the
enjoyability and the feeling of
a decent amusement park ride,
I give U.S. Marshals a three
stars. However, since the
weather is improving, your

money may be better spent go
ing to a real amusement park.
To me, U.S. Marshals was
more like watting in an amuse
ment park line. / mean, the
weather's nice, and at least
you're not at work, but get to
the good stuff already!
I've seen much, much
worse, but U.S. Marshals is
probably not a movie I'll re
member much about in a
month or so. Two and a half
stars (out of five).
And in a quick Oscar
redux, I'd like to say some
thing. Overall I was pleased
with the awards. Helen Hunt,

In Case You Missed AIt movie here to amuse you

by Eileen O'Donnell
Movie Columnist
Of all the film genres, the
mob movie is one of the most
captivating. Since the birth of
the motion picture, gangsters
have been glorified. The mob
movie has evolved over time,
from the romanticized black
and white to the violent blood
bath of GoodFellas.
One of the most popular
and most quoted mob movies
of all time is GoodFellas. The
film was nominated for six
Academy Awards, including
Best Picture and Best Director
(Martin Scorsese).
The cast of GoodFellas is
a very talented one, starring
Ray Liotta (Eight Men Out;
Corrina, Corrina; Unlawful
Entry), Joe Pesci {Casino, My
Cousin Vinny), Robert DeNiro
(Wag the Dog), Paul Sorvino,
and Lorraine Bracco.
GoodFellas, like Casino
and Donnie Brasco, is based on
a true story. The movie itself

is based on the book Wiseguy
by Nicholas Pileggi.
GoodFellas begins right
in the middle of things. Henry
Hill (Liotta) takes the story
back to his childhood and his
dream of being a gangster. He
starts out as a run¬

ner for mobster
Paulie Cicero
(Sorvino), and
quickly moves up
the ranks. Even as
a kid, Henry be
comes very well re
spected and well
known, but be
cause he is only half
Sicilian, he could
never become a

"made man."
Henry, Tommy DeVito,
and Jimmy "the Gent" Conway
(DeNiro) are involved in rack
eteering, extortion, and hijack
ing. The movie follows
Henry's life in the mob from
errand boy to drug runner. Af
ter living the good life for a
while with wife Karen (Bracco),

lives of his wife and daughters,
Henry tells the feds what he
knows and Paulie and Jimmy
are sent to prison for their mob
crimes.
Joe Pesci's performance
as Tommy DeVito is unforget
tariis

Henry'_s world begins to fall
apart. Bracco, who received an
Academy Award nomination
for her performance, also nar
rates the story of Henry's life
in the mob.
Following the formula of

the mob movie, everything
comes to a climax after surveil
lance by the FBI. Henry faces
a long sentence if convicted on
narcotics charges. He also
stands the chance of being
killed by Paulie's men for his in
volvement with drugs, some
thing which was strictly prohib
ited. To save himself and the

most memorable line from Taxi
Driver. GoodFellas has even
been parodied in Steven
Spielberg's Animaniacs.
"Goodfeathers," a cartoon
sketch about three pigeon
wiseguys, draws largely on
GoodFellas, as well as on other
films in the genre.
Joe Pesci's performance

me, over-me
top character is
volatile and unpre
dictable. Pesci's fa
mous line "Funny
how? I'm a clown,
here to amuse you?"
is etched into film
history and is
quoted almost as
much as Robert
DeNiro's "Are you
talking to me?" the

h this movie is almost comi
cal, as he plays the melodra
matic wiseguy. Pesci received
the Best Supporting Actor Os
car in 1990 for his performance
as Tommy. DeNiro's soft-spo
ken, yet commanding presence
is among one of his greatest
performances. Although
Pesci's role as Nicky Santoro in
Casino, which also starred
DeNiro, is very similar to his
portrayal of Tommy, his role in
this film is much more likeable
and convincing.
GoodFellas is extremely
violent and explicit, but in or
der to tell the story properly,
these elements are necessary.
The use of flashback and sus
pended animation at pivotal
points are very effective tools
in telling the story. The voice
over done by Liotta and
Bracco's characters gives the
film a Wonder Years kind of fla
vor. The difference: Kevin and
Winnie are heavily into co
caine, and are now in the Wit
ness Protection Program.



Paper from here to the Pacific

by Kyle Heulitt
GECO Columnist
By 2005, when it
reaches capacity, the Fresh
Kills Landfill on Staten Island
will be the tallest peak on the
East_/Doast between Maine
and Florida.
The U.S. recycles only
11% of its total waste com
pared to Japan, which recycles
50%. Sixty-five percent of our
trash goes to landfills, half of
which will close within five
years. U.S. businesses buy an
estimated 5 billion cubic feet
of polystyrene foam "pea
nuts" a year. That's enough
to fill the Empire State Build
ing more than 135 times.
! The U.S. produces 70%
of the world's solid waste.
Paper:
¦

It takes 390 gallons of
oil to produce one ton of pa
pier. That ton of paper, when
disposed of, takes up nearly
eight cubic feet of public land
fill space.
That public landfill is
approximately 36% waste
paper products.
Every one million pages
of paper not printed saves 85
pulp trees.
In prehistoric times,
60% of the earth's surface was

covered by forests; today, that
amount has been reduced by
30% and is still shrinking.
Paper and paperboard con
stitute 36% of the total amount
of solid waste produced.
Paper can be recycled
about four times before it loses
its tensile strength.

energy than making paper from
trees and creates much less air
and water pollution.
Every year, Americans
throw away enough office paper
to build a wall 12 feet high
stretching from LA to NYC.

If only 100,000 people
stopped their junk mail, we
could save about 150,000 trees
every year (and think of all the
junk mail we get!)
If we all recycled our
Sunday papers, we could save
over 500,000 trees each week.

months to rebuild our entire

Making cans from re
cycled aluminum cuts related
air pollution (for example, sul
fur dioxides which create acid

rain) by 95%.
It takes 19 times as much
energy to manufacture an alu
minum can from raw ore than
from recycled aluminum.
The average aluminum
can goes from the supermarket
shelf to scrap and back to the
shelf in 42 days.
The average American

clude, for example, how to use
subject and word searches in
MUSCAT to find books, how
to find materials in other librar
ies, which journal indexes con
tain appropriate information
and how to use these efficiently,
how to discover if good topi

CONFLICT & Consensus

A plea for sanity

To the Editor:

ing that individual here, divide
the hosting responsibilities, and
share the marketing for the lec
ture. . For example, WSPAC, in
setting up its programming for
1998-99, sent a letter to all
departments and programs ask
ing whether they would be in
terested in cosponsoring speak
ers. Positive responses came
from three departments, and
next year's series (diminished
in size) will include at least two
cosponsored speakers.
3. If voluntary compli
ance is not effective, we might
think about reducing our bud-

As we are in the middle
of scheduling events for the
next year, I hear everyone
complaining about our fren
zied calendar of events. In an
effort to bring some sanity to
the scheduling process, let me
review the facts and then sug
gest some remedies.
The Facts:
1. Scheduling as it now
exists operates on free market
principles: as many events are
scheduled on one night as
space is available, and atten
dance occurs on a demand ha-

S1S. 2. This year, at least four
groups which strive to educate
the entire campus community
about other cultures scheduled
events against each other: the
Senior Scholars' Seminar, the
Intercultural Resource Center,
the International Students, and
the Area Studies Symposium.
Many other major conflicts
occurred as well.,
3. We have chosen not
to exert any control over
scheduling; no advice is of
fered as to possible conflicts
which may occur. This laissez
faire approach is exacerbated
by the use of Gopher for
scheduling purposes. It is now
possible to find out whether a
particular space is available on
a particular evening and to just
ignore what else is going on
that night. It is also possible
to check the campus schedule
by date , but some would per
haps prefer not to know.
_> * r
\\F a i,
tt
_t

have little money available to
bring in lecturers and perform
ing artists.
5. Moreover,-something
like a turf battle seems to have
erupted between certain pro
grams and departments. If a
series already exists in conjunc
tion with one program, then it
seems that each must mount a
spate of lectures or an addi
tional series in an effort to
prove competitive.
6. Despite the fact that a
large portion of tuition money
is expended on speakers and
performances, most students
do not attend these events un
less they are required in con
junction with a class. Many
professors hesitate to require
students to attend events out
side of class, either because
they themselves do not live
nearby and cannot attend, or
because they are reluctant to
require peripheral intellectual
experiences.

7. We may have confused
the student cry "there isn't
enough to do at Gettysburg"
with the need to pour money
into our Lecture and Perform
ing Arts budget ant to sched
ule more and more events. (Ad
mittedly a conjecture rather
than a fact.)
Possible Remedies:
1. Every group which
sponsors a series of lectures or
performing arts might think
about reducing the number of
such events. All of us are
stretched too thin} Next year's
Area Studies Symposium, for
instance, will offer fewer pre
sentations than in past years.
The topics will be provocative
ones, however, dealing with
controversial issues in Latin
America.

4. We have created
Common Hour to bring the
campus community together in
a mutual intellectual experi
ence, but we have not dimin
ished the amount of evening
programs which are being
funded. Very few. programs
are well attended, even Com
mon Hour, which includes that
rarity, a free lunch. The "Com
mon Hour Effect" occurs natu
rally on those _campuses that
,
F s r r r r

2. Co-sponsorship may
be one way to encourage larger
attendance at lectures. Thus,
two _' ciepartments or groups
would mutually agree on a
speaker, share the cost of bring-

gets for such programming in
future years. In their place, we
might set up a Faculty Presen
tation Series in which certain
individual faculty members or
departmental teams did presen
tations on such offbeat topics
as their own research, film criti
cism, or politics and world af
fairs. The Socratic Club is a
great student venue for student
debate and needs to be encour
aged. In other words, we need
to stimulate each other and
model for each other the pro
cess of making sense of the
world in which we find our
seives.

4. Of course, we have no
intention of cutting ourselves
off from that world or of ceas
ing to bring new ideas and per
forming techniques onto our
campus from other places.
However, we might try to cul
tivate an attitude of what the
Buddhists call "mindfulness" in
our- scheduling. Such an atti
tude would require that every
individual, every program, ev
ery department commit them
selves to considering carefully
what else is scheduled and
whether it would be a thought
less gesture program a signifi
cant event against some other
program of similar content. We

Consider this

Three hundred people
have spoken, and they want a
dance club.
Last Friday night, the So
cial Life Committee sponsored
a BYOB Video Dance Party in
the CUB Ballroom.
Poor attendance has often
plagued such events, and the
party did start out slowly with
only a handful of people mill
ing around the Ballroom, per
haps due to the fact that stu
dents were mesmerized by co
median Alonzo Bodden. After
his show ended around 11 p.m.,
the Ballroom quickly filled up
with dancers.
The video dance party of
fered dancers the opportunity
to request songs, and although
some choices, such as ABBA's
"Dancing Queen," were ques
tionable, even the security
guards could be seen occasion
ally mouthing the words to
songs.

This one-time event was
a success, but does that imply
that a permanent dance club is
a feasible option for Gettysburg
College? Will the novelty of a
dance club wear off? Will atten
dance decline as time goes on,
or during Rush or other special
events?

The success of college
sponsored social events in the
past varies with the event. En
thusiasm is currently high for a
dance club, but many activities
and events look good on paper.
A one-time turnout does not
guarantee success in the future.
The target _audience for
the dance club is likely to be first
year students, possibly as a
means of discouraging them
from attending fraternity par
ties. However, students will be
required to be 18 years of age
in order to enter. Some first
year students have not turned
18 by the time they enter col
lege. Is it fair to bar thern from
campus events?
What to do about this di
lemma?

Before finalizing any

school should consider sinking
a lot of money into a dance club.
If attendance drops off

CONFLICT & Consensus
The Pachyderm y s Pulpit

Maryland republicans? If spossible.

by John Dunlap
Political Columnist
A few miles to our south,
as we all know, stands the state
of Maryland, one of the most
Democratic states in the coun
try. For 30 years Democrats
have controlled the state's Gov
ernorship and for over 65 years
the state General Assembly. In
1992, with the exception of
Arkansas, Maryland gave then
Governor Clinton his biggest
majority in his election as Presi
dent. In recent history, only
President Ronald Reagan in

1984, and President George
Bush in 1988 were able to
break the Democratic hold 1 on
the state.
Today things are chang
ing in the Old Line State, as the
Republican Party is finally be
ing competitive. For years, the
GOP was a carbon copy of the
Democrats in the state. Repub
lican candidates tended to be
very liberal and many times
from Washington, DC, not
Maryland. Individuals like
Reagan Aide Linda Chaves ran
for office, not native Maryland-

ers. Democratic leaders were
usually firmly based in the
greater Baltimore area. That
too is changing. The state's
largest counties are Montgom
ery and Prince George's Coun
ties. Both sit right outside
Washington. These people do
not read the Baltimore Sun or
watch Baltimore television, but
instead read the Washington
Post and get their news from
the nation's capital.
In 1994 for the first time
in over a hundred years, some
one from the Washington sub
urbs, Prince George's County
executive Parris Glendening
was elected Governor.
Now the GOP has cre
ated a farm team and is creat
ing a statewide network to win
elections. Four of the eight
members of the Maryland del
egation to the United States
House of Representatives are

Republicans and GOP numbers
in the General Assembly are
rising. Republicans hold 41 of
141 state House of Delegates
seats and 15 of 47 State Senate
seats. This means that Repub
licans are building a base and
the party is doing this by mov
ing to the right. No longer are
Maryland Republicans "Want
to be" Democrats, but they
now stand for a conservative

set of principles.
The 1994
midterm election
was

a watershed year for Maryland
Republicans. First, the minor
ity leader of the House of Del
egates, Ellen Sauerbrey of Bal
timore County shocked the
state's political establishment
by defeating the party's pre
sumptive nominee United
States Congresswoman Helen
Bentley. Mrs. Sauerbrey's vic
tory was a win for the Repub
lican right. Sauerbrey is a con
servative Republican who
based her campaign on her pro
posed 24% state income tax cut
as well as holding the line on
future government spending.
Sauerbrey attacked Mrs.
Bentley for being too cozy with
Democrats, such as Governor
William Donald Schaiffer,
whom Sauerbrey had battled in

the legislature. By a margin of beat the Governor and make
52% to 38% Sauerbrey de- major gains in the General
feated the Congresswoman. In Assembly in 1998. Even with
the general election, Mr. the economy growing and
Glendening attacked Sauerbrey crime dropping, Parris
hard for her pro-life stance on Glendening finds himself
abortion, as well as her oppo- extremely vulnerable_,
sition to gun control. First of all, the Maryland
Glendening attacked Sauerbrey economic growth rate is slower
for being out of the mainstream than the rest of the nations and
of Maryland politics, but the fundraising, as well as pensidn
Sauerbrey tax message domi- scandals have

neared the
end it
looked as if

Republicans for the first time
since Spiro Agnew in 1966
would take the Governor's
Mansion. On election night,
the race was to close to call, and
with the counting of the absen
tee ballots Glendening's four to
one fundraising edge came in
handy as he was elected Gov
ernor by two-tenths of a per
cent. His victory was marred
by accusations of fraud in Bal
timore City. Sauerbrey even
took the election to court but
her case was denied.
Today however, many of
Sauerbrey's accusations of
fraud are being confirmed. In
the past four years the
Maryland GOP has continued
to grow in numbers. Republi
cans feel confidant they can

' _™ sions testing and
state funding of football
stadiums have hurt the
governor.
Governor Glendening is
facing trouble within his own
party as he has trouble keep
ing Democrats together. Hart
ford County Executive Eileen
Rehrman is giving the governor
a strong challenge within his

own primary.
Retired Washington
Redskins football player Ray
Schoenke is also taking on the
governor. If the governor can
make it through the primary,
then he must defeat Mrs.
Sauerbrey again. Unlike four
years ago, today Sauerbrey has
high name recognition, a great
deal more cash, and has been
campaigning virtually non-stop
for governor for the last three
years. She has also softened her
image talking more about edu
cation, something she knows a
lot about considering she was
a biology teacher in Baltimore
County.
The issues that Sauerbrey
is concentrating on are the
economy, education and ethics.
She promises to bust up the
"cozy clique" who run Annapo
lis and to stop runaway state
spending. Howard County

Executive Charles Ecker is tak
ing on Sauerbrey in the Repub
lican primary, accusing her of
being overly conservative. This
does not appear to be working
as Sauerbrey is far ahead in the
polls and has the state GOP vir
tually united behind her.
National GOP figures are
rushing into Maryland to help
out her campaign like Gover
nors Tommy Thompson of
Wisconsin, John Engler of
Michigan and Terry Branstand
of Iowa. Former Governor
William Weld of Massachusetts
and Governor Christie
Whitman of New Jersey, both
moderates have paid visits.
Former Vice President Dan
Quayle, the 1996 Republican
Nominee for Vice President
Jack Kemp and Congressman
John Kasich all have helped
Sauerbrey raise money.
A recent visit by retired
Marine Lieutenant Colonel and

the 1994 Republican Candi
date for the United States Sen
ate from Virginia, Oliver
North, caused controversy as
both Democrats and Republi
cans attacked Sauerbrey for in
viting the very conservative Mr.
North.
The balancing act that
Ellen Sauerbrey must perform
is difficult. The Maryland Re
publican Party has one of the
most liberal members of Con
gress, Connie Morrella, and
one of the most conservative
members of Congress, Roscoe
Bartlett, in its leadership. It is
up to Sauerbrey to hold them
together and win enough
Democrats in this overwhelm
ingly Democratic state to be
come governor. With Parris
Glendening's unpopularity and
a divided Democratic Party
than this could be the year.

The election of a Repub
lican governor in 1998 can fur
ther strengthen the national Re
publican party by making one
more state competitive; never
again will Republicans have to
concede Maryland just because
it is Maryland.

Passage to
Africa

Their business is

Sanity

reporters be more concerned
with gaining American atten
tion and interest in their coun
try rather than what our presi
dent is doing behind closed
doors? The African country,
Ghana was extremely excited
to host Mr. Clinton. He spoke
before a very large, enthusias
tic crowd. In his speech he
stated, "Democracy requires
human rights for everyone, ev
erywhere. For men and
women, for children and the
elderly, for people of different
cultures and tribes and back
grounds. A good society hon
ors its entire family."
President Clinton is ex
cited about promoting free
markets and democracy and
aiding the African people, who
are in need. However, my con
cern is, why aren't the efforts
being made to make America
better?

by Cammie Grant
Columnist

President Clinton is on a
twelve day tour of Africa. He
is there to assure Africans aid
and attention from the United
States and he is speaking out in
support of democracy and free
markets.
Prior to beginning his
journey, to Africa, some specu
lated that the president was
leaving the country to avoid the
Lewinsky controversy. The trip
to Africa has been planned for
at least a year. It is a coinci
dence that the trip and the in
vestigation are occurring at the
same time. There is no reason,
unless the president was called
to testify in court, that the Af
rica trip should be canceled.
James Bennet, The New
York Times wrote, "This trip
has come at a propitious time
for Mr. Clinton, who is under
pressure at home from the in
dependent counsel investigat
ing his relationship with
Monica S. Lewinsky". But it
was clear that the President

would not escape his troubles
in Africa. The Times stated that
"Ghanaian reporters grilled
their American colleagues
about details of the crisis"
Once again, it is sad to see
that other countries are aware
of President Clinton's lack of
morals. A few weeks ago,
Saddam Hussein was running
clips of Wag the Dog in addi
tion to airing Clinton's Cabi
net members being shouted off
stage in Ohio. Now, the Gha
naians are questioning Ameri
cans about Clinton's alleged
affair. Shouldn't the Ghanaian

Thousands of American
citizens claim their homes on
city streets under bridges; jails
are filled to capacity; the bud
get suffers; when is the execu
tive office going to focus its
undivided attention on our
country's problems, before ad
dressing problems in other
countries and giving aid?
I am proud of the United
States. I take tremendous pride
in our government and its
structure. It is, however, an
embarrassment to read in
magazines and newspapers that
foreign countries are aware of
Clinton's personalcn ' s/s and
even more so, want to report
on it. I do, however give ku
dos to Clinton's foreign policy
efforts.

Free floating hostility

by Sara Sprenkle
Random Thinker
It's a small campus.
Duh.
What that means,
though, is that when you speak
loudly of a person, someone
nearby could be his or her
friend/roommate/signif leant
other. On Monday night, I was
at Servo, minding my own busi
ness, when I heard a certain
female speak of one of my
friends and call her a not-so
nice name. She didn't seem to
care who heard her, or maybe
she was ignorant of the fact that
one of her verbal victim's
friends might hear. So, I guess
I was within my right to tell her
that I thought she was out of

ne. I feel bad that I didn't
defend my friend because what
the verbal assaulter said was
totally not true, but I felt out
of line since I didn't know the
girl or anyone she was talking
to. The point is remember
the next time you complain
about (your TA/a classmate/a
person down the hall) someone
nearby may overhear you and
take issue with what you said
about his or her friend.
Now I'm in a bind. I
want to write about another
rude person, but that doesn't
seem very random. Oh, wait, I
thought of something else be
fore I write about that.
The snooze button is ev
ery college student's friend.
Every alarm clock I have had
has an alarm that goes off seven
minutes after the snooze but
ton was hit.

Why seven minutes? Was
there some study done that
found that seven minutes is the
optimal time for someone to
wake up after a first warning
alarm? Just wondering. I'm not
saying there wasn't. If anyone
knows, send a letter to the edi
tor, Box 434.

I like cherry flavored
stuff, but I don't like cherries.
I know other people who like
some flavor, but they don't like
the real thing, so I'm not that
weird.
Anyway, back to the rude
guy... My friends and I went to
Myrtle Beach over Spring
Break, and we went to the
Hard Rock Cafe.
I ordered The Pig sand
wich because the menu says
that I haven't been to the Hard
Rock Cafe until I've had that.
I have been at the Hard Rock
Cafe in New York before, so if
I wanted to tell people I had
been there, I had to get the
sandwich.
The waiter took my order
as an invitation to mock me.

When he brought the
meal, he asked, "Who is the
barbecue chicken?" Then, he
asked, "Who's the pig?" I re
luctantly answered-fodder for
the fire.
After that, the waiter
would stop by and comment on
how quickly I ate my food and
how much of my food I ate. He
did not do this once or twice—
he did this every time he
stopped to check for refills, to
ask how our meals were, to
pick up our plates, to get a
desert order. Every time.
I don't know why the
waiter thought that this was a
good way to score tips. It
seems that my tablemates
found this amusing, but I was
not amused.
The guy ended up with
over a 20% tip, under my pro
test. My tip suggestion was 94
cents. However, it seems that
my tablemates thought other¬

. I understand that some
restaurants have some strange
service philosophy with pur
posely rude waiters, but Hard
Rock isn't one of them. Like
improvisation in rock and roll,
an impromptu waiter is some
times good but not always.

Opinionated Editor
Okay Gettyburgian fans,
given the fact that I was aban
doned by a couple of my writ
ers this week, you're all in for
a special treat. As editor, I am
usually consigned to reading
what others write. However,
today I trade in that hat

to become a writer
Actually, I have
traded in nothing,
rather, I am pull
ing double duty
tonight!
As a re
sult, I give to _JF
all the loyal _jdj
readers out 5_^
there a «_2
written _^Cm
contnbu- _^JJ
t i o n .
However, if
you are a
glass is half full
person, I highly
reccomend that
you stop read
ing this
right now.
Tak¬

ing
theme from the
comedic

,
George Carhn, I offer to the
readership something known as
"free floating hostility." Enjoy
Kids and guns. I know
that our violence prone society
has desensitized many of us to
violence, but surely there must
be many out there that share
my abhoration at the shootings
which took place in a small
Arkansas town. How is it that
we have denegrated as a soci
ety so much that two thirteen
and eleven year old kids can
shoot fourteen classmates and
a teacher?
¦ There are apologists out
there that would be inclined to
think that it is just the actions
of mentally unstable and impul
sively immature kids, however,
where the hell did a thirteen

and eleven year old get a veri
table arsenal of weapons?! Not
only should these kids be pros
ecuted to the full extent of the
law, but those who had the
weapons within reach should
be brought up on a few hun
dred charges of endangering
the welfare of a child, one for

each student at that school.
Okay, enough of sound
ing like a real right winger.
Moving on. Turn signals. Vir
tually all of the readers of this
publication are drivers. When
is it that people stopped using
turn signals? There is a reason
that the law requires that ev
ery car has them, so people
know where a car is going! Has
it become so difficult to move
that little lever up and down?
Please, for everyone's benefit,
use your damn turn signals!
' The media. When did we
become' a 'society of scandals?
Ever since Watergate, every
hack with a tape recorder and
a camera crew is trying to be
come the next Woodward-and
Bersteui. Why is it that Bill
Clinton is off in Africa and the

main story CNN runs is that a
reporter asked him about the
allegations? Who the hell
cares? Personally I take an inter
est in our foreign policy, and
making headway in Africa is
much more important than
some contrived scandal. I don't
give a damn who he slept
with! If he co¬

erced people
to lie, im
peach him,
otherwise
leave it
i alone!
i Re
I sponsibil
|_ ity. Why
P_^ 1 is it that
it seems
as if ev
eryone al
ways has
an excuse?
If you make
_t a mistake,
P own up to it.
If you make a
commitment
to someone,
follow through
on it. There
used to be a thing
called honor. A
person word

_^^B s was
_^^_B seen as a bond.
Where did those days go?
I'd be a lot more forgiving if
people would just own up to
their faults.
Finally, let me say a few
things about complacency.
Don't people care anymore.
Why is it that it takes someone
Greek bashing to bring a letter
to the editor to this paper?
What ever happened to people
climbing on a soapbox and tell
ing others what they think.
People, it is okay to get angry,
it is okay to voice your opin
ions! It doesn't take long, and
trust me, it can be rather
therepeutic. So I challenge all
of you opinionated people out
there to sound off at the top of
your lungs. Maybe if more of
us did this, less people would
feel the urge to blow fellow
human beings away.

people believe can never be resolved.
More than just a prejudice, Rutstein
suggests that racism is a form of
prejudice that has evolved into an
obsessive psychological disorder that
deeply affects perpetrator and target
alike. Hailed as "a brutally honest
portrayal of racism that offers a
solution and does not leave us with
hopelessness", Rutstein's book
"Racism: Unraveling die Fear" was
cited by the Gustavus Meyers Center
for the Study of Human Rights. A

made up mostly of students, but also
including faculty and administrators will
meet in April to discuss your suggestions. It

speaker is currently being sought and we are

awaiting his reply — your input is still very
valuable: Elie Wiesel (brief bio: He has
worked on behalf of oppressed people for
much of his adult life. His personal
experience of the holocaust has led him to use
his talents as an _^ author, teacher, and
storyteller to defend human rights and peace
throughout the world. His efforts have
earned him the Presidential Medal of
Freedom, the United States Congressional
Gold Medal, Medal of Liberty Award, and
the Nobel Peace Prize.)

A sampling of some of the more recent Fall
Convocation speakers at Gettysburg College
include" Edwards James Olmos; Morris
Dees; Dr. M. Joycelyn Elders; Robert Jay
Lifton; Alex Kotlowitz; Li Lu; and Maya
Angelou.
I am interested in names of students, faculty,
and administrators who would like to serve
on the working Fall Convocation committee.
You may recommend yourself or someone
else. This would be an April, Sept.-Nov.
Commitment. In April we would only meet
once or twice and then in the Fall there would
be one standing meeting weekly and a
commitment to serve on one sub-committee.
Types of sub-committees include: marketing,

The NCAA Men's
by Steve Jenkins
Sports Editor
It is March again, and
nobody cares about coming in
like a lion or that stupid lamb.
Any sports fan with a heartbeat
knows what has been going on
for the last two weeks. In
jected with passion, feeling,
and the way sports were meant
to be, March marked the be
ginning of the NCAA Division
I Basketball tournament; oth
erwise known as March Mad¬

ness. Why is it called March
Madness you ask? What is so
mad about it? Well, March is
the time of year when the
NCAA brings the 64 best bas
ketball teams in the country
together for one big, rip-roar
ing clash of the most intense
gritty, powerful, and exciting
basketball in the world.
" "But I like the NBA," you
say. "I just go watch the Wash

Basketball Tournament has been whittled down to four teams. Who will overcome?

homeruns, 80 yard runs, and
power play goals; rather, they
are supposed to mean some
thing. Sports are great because
of the way you feel when your
team loses, or when you see
guys like Christian Laettner hit
a 20 footer with .2 seconds on
the clock. The emotion is the
reason we love sports.
"The Tournament,"
which started with 64 teams
has now been whittled down to
four. Sixty teams are now at
home thinking of the season
that could have been. With all
the heart in the world, and the
NCAA championship on the
minds of the four remaining
teams (North Carolina, Ken
tucky, Utah, and Stanford),
emotions will be running high,
and some hearts will be sink
ing low. But what you will see
is guys diving for balls, sweat
ing, bleeding and crying to
gether, and playing sports how
they should be played- not for
the money...for the love.

Pump the B.A.S.S

This group of guys keeps the spirit of our campus up

by Ben Wolf
Contributing Reporter
The B.A.S.S. (Bullet Ath
letic Support Squad) house is a
special interest group whose
goal is to build team support
on campus and in the commu
nity for Gettysburg College
teams. Since each member has
been a collegiate athlete here,
it was obvious that there was
something lacking at most
sporting events spirit.
They felt that there was
a pessimistic and uninterested
attitude towards many sports.
This was brought to their at-

Members

tention with evidence of poor
attendance and very little en
thusiasm at the games.
Viewing this over and
over again, the group decided
to make it their goal to change
the campus's athletic spirit by
forming a special interest
house. Through forming this
team, the group aimed to make
changes in the community and
the campus to reverse the un
enthusiastic athletic attitude.
Working through the special
interest program format, the

house created several "pro
grams" which hoped to draw
attention to the sporting events
on campus.
Some of the programs
that the house has initiated
over the past academic year
include: a homecoming ban
ner contest, the singing of the
national anthem at many home
events; the posting of Gettys
burg College athletic calendars
throughout the community and
on campus; the mailing of fli
ers; and a series of articles in
the Gettysburgian (like this

If school spirit is what you are all about, then BASS may be the group to follow.

one), which highlight different
athletes and teams.
As for the individual
members of B.A.S.S., each feels
that he is working towards a
goal that will benefit his col¬

lege. House member Chris and it definitely has enhanced
Bowman adds, "This college their experiences here at Get
supports many successful ath- tysburg College_,
letic teams that win champion- Although B.A.S.S. recog-

ships, and we feel that it is nec
essary to recognize and support
their efforts. Our athletic pro
grams continue to grow, and we
feel that it is time for the stu
dent body to support the ef
forts of their peers."
Everyone in the house
shares these sentiments and
contributes something valuable
to the team. Also, the house
feels that working and living
together has greatly enhanced
the friendships that previously
existed among its members and
advisor (Kelly Jones). The
house says, "We love you
Kelly!"
The group credits their
personal growth and program
successes directly to the special
interest program of Gettysburg
College. The college has pro
vided them with a very unique
and interesting opportunity,

nizes that some progress has
been made toward achieving
their ultimate goal, they feel
that much more needs to be
accomplished. B.A.S.S. will
have another opportunity to
build on what they have
started, because they have been
granted the special interest
house again for the upcoming
year. You can be sure to see
some upcoming programs com
ing from this group. They plan
to continue their current pro
grams, and hope to create even
better ones for the future.
Some of the ideas being con
sidered include a sand volley
ball tournament, making T
shirts, a cannon for outdoor
home games, and much more.
B.A.S.S. looks forward to
the continued support of the
campus and would like to
thank everyone who has con-




Woods and Co. splits with Mules

by Ronnie Beeman
Staff Reporter The Gettysburg Bullets
baseball team opened up their
Centennial Conference season
Wednesday with a spilt against
Muhlenburg College.
In the first game, the
Bullet's won 4-3. Paul Koether
pitched a complete game to
pick up his fourth win of the
season. Koether fanned four
and walked one in seven in
nings of work.
The offensive and defen
sive star of the day was Bill
Neston. In the top of the sixth,
with a runner on second,
Neston made a spectacular
catch in the right-center field
gap to prevent Muhlenburg
from taking the lead.
In the bottom half of the
sixth inning, Drew Lavenburg
led the inning off with a
double.

Chris "Sweet Lou
Lunardi followed with a sacn

fice bunt to move Lavenburg to
third, setting the stage for
Neston. Once again Neston
was up to the challenge. He
plated Lavenburg, the game
winning run, with a sacrifice
fl y; "In the second
game, the ball just
didn't bounce our

way. We can
come back."
In the second game of the
double header the Bullet's eight
game winning streak came to
an end with an 8-6 defeat to
Muhlenburg. The Mules took
advantage of several Bullet mis
takes to exploded for six runs
in the fifth inning. Freshman
Tom Boob(l-l) suffered his
first varsity loss.
The Bullets did not go
down quietly. After scoring a
run in the fifth, the Bullets

made a charge in the seventh.
Kevin Grimm hit a triple
with one out. John Woods
grounded to shortstop to score
Grimm. Bill Beining walked
but was left stranded as the
game ended.
Daryl Clancy, Bill
Neston, Kevin Grimm, and
John Woods each had two hits
a piece.
"The first game we
played well," said designated
hitter Bill Beining. "In the sec
ond game, the ball just didn't
bounce our way. We can come
back." The Bullets look forward
to an away game Thursday
against Juniata and a home
conference double header Sat
urday against Ursinas.

Congratulations to Daryl
Clancy for being selected to the
Centennial Conference Honor
Roll for his effort against
Catholic last week. Clancy
went 3-4, and plated the game
winning run in the bottom of
the sixth inning.

El Nino postpones softball
team's journey to greatness

From Staff Reports
The Gettysburg College
Softball team was idle last week
due to El Nino and had three
postponed games.
The rest last week, how
ever, makes this week a tough
one as the Bullets face two
make-up twinbills - at
Elizabethtown on Monday and
York on Friday - sandwiched
between two regular twinbills
- at Juniata on Tuesday and at

Swarthmore on Saturday.
Gettysburg handed
Elizabethtown two losses, win
ning decisively, 5-2 and 6-4.
The Bullets overall
Record stands at 4-3, and they
look to dominate the competi
tion for the rest of the season.
Traci Bullock, Jen White,
and Jess Rising have been pro
viding much of the offensive
support with Rising scoring a
team high ten runs.
Melissa Hazzard leads the

pitching attack for the Bullets
and has appeared in four of the
Bullets seven games thus far.
Mary Beth Korekjo is
ranked in the conference in
many offensive categories and
hopes to provide the senior
leadership that the young team
that may need guidance.
With all the talent and
hitting power that this team has
there is no telling how far they
can go. The more runs you
score the better.

Sports Weekly —
Men's lacrosse ripping competition with offensive barrages

by Henry Fawell
Staff Writer This week, the Gettys
burg men's lacrosse team im
proved its record to 3-1 in
magnificent fashion by trounc
ing their opponents with a
combined score of 44-7. Two
outstanding victories helped
the Bullets move up two spots
in the national polls from No.
8 to No. 6.
Gettysburg's luck began
on Tuesday, St. Patrick's Day,
as unranked Wooster College
came in to town looking for
an upset. The Bullets dashed
all hope for that, or even a
close game, as they unloaded
22 shots in the game's first
period. Wooster's single shot
that quarter sailed wide of the
cage.

The barrage never ceased
as Gettysburg outshot their op
ponent 55-14 throughout the
contest. Before the smoke had
finally cleared, 15 different
players had scored for the Bul
lets in their impressive 23-2
victory.
Senior Scott Lowery led

the Gettysburg offense by rack
ing up four goals and an assist
on the afternoon. Juniors Lee
Hemming and Ross Garretson
both scored three times, with
Garretson dishing out a team
high three assists.
Defensively, Gettysburg

carried a shutout into the final
minute of the contest before
Wooster managed to sneak in
two goals to help salvage their
trip. Goalie Andrew Barter tal
lied four saves in his three quar
ters of play.
The Bullets also proved
their dominance in unsettled

situations as they collected 40
groundballs to Wooster's 14.
On Saturday * Head
Coach Janczyk_'s squad faced
No. 16 Amherst College at a
chilly Musselman Stadium.
The cold weather could do
little, however, to slow down
the Gettysburg offense, which
reeled off five unanswered

"" ¦""¦ """ ¦¦"' """""^_Sff^/ _anft_^_Glattmei
Lacrosse players huddle-up after their battle with Amherst College on Saturday.

goals in the first 10:50 of play.
The Bullets headed into halftime
with a comfortable 9-2 lead.
Little changed in the sec
ond half, except for the Amherst
goalies. Their reserves, however,
could do even less to stop a Get
tysburg offense which scores
over 15 goals a game. Hemming
and freshman Pete Milliman
each tallied four goals in the
drubbing, while Lowery added
two goals and three assists to a
convincing 21-5 win.
While the Bullets needed

little help with improving their
rankings, they certainly received
a boost from some of the best
teams in the nation. Defending
champion and top ranked
Nazereth College was upset by
Adelphi College on Saturday,
while third ranked "Washington
College fell to Roanoke, a team
the Bullets beat 10-9 in the sea
son opener. Ohio Wesleyan sur
vived the weekend's shake-up by
knocking off Salisbury State,
thereby claiming the Division III
throne.

The Bullets will travel to
Mount St. Mary's this Wednes
day before taking on annual ri
val Hampden-Sydney this Satur
day at Musselman Stadium.

Fake ID ring busted
Gettysburg listed as one of 35 known distribution locations

from st aff reports
A large counterfeiting ring special
izing in the manufacture and distribu
tion of "near-perfect" New Jersey photo
driver's licenses for sale to college stu
dents at campuses throughout the east
coast has been dismantled, the New Jer
sey State Police announced Tuesday
Gettysburg College was listed in the
police report as one of the locations of
known distribution of the fake licenses.
According to law enforcement
officials, the alleged illegal counterfeit
ing operation was in business to supply
fake New Jersey driver's licenses to col¬

lege students under the legal drinking
age of 21, enabling them to purchase
alcoholic beverages in bars and liquor
stores.
In announcing the arrest and fil
ing of criminal charges against the al
leged counterfeiter and six operatives
allegedly employed to sell and distrib
ute the fake driver's licenses, detectives
assigned to the New Jersey State Alco
holic Beverage Control Enforcement
Unit estimate that the illegal counter
feiting operation netted an estimated
$80,000 per month over a period of at
least two years.

"This enterprise not only realized
enormous illegal profits for the defen
dants, but its very existence strikes at
the core of our efforts to regulate un
derage drinking," New Jersey State At
torney General Peter Verniero said. "I
am concerned by these findings and the
actions of those individuals who know
ingly participated in this fraud. I com
mend the State Police and the other law
enforcement agencies for their diligence
in putting an end to this illegal activ
ity." The Attorney General also noted
that he has discussed the investigative
findings with Transportation Commis
sioner John Haley and that a review of
the New Jersey photo driver's license
program has been initiated. Law offi
cials noted that while certain aspects of

the investigation remain active and on
going, the arrests have effectively put
the illegal counterfeit operation out of
business.
According to Col. Williams, the
defendants were arrested by state po
lice detectives in cooperation with the
Rutgers police department and the
Philadelphia Police Department on
February 14th, 15th and March 1 lth,
1998. The charges include forgery,
criminal conspiracy, possession of forg
ery devices and counterfeiting New
Jersey drivers' licenses.
The investigation began in 1996

Graphic by Mike Williams
when officers from the Rutgers Univer
sity police Department and the detec
tives from the New Jersey State Police
Alcoholic Beverage Control Enforce
ment Unit began uncovering near per
fect counterfeit New Jersey driver's li
cense while conducting routine identifi
cation checks at licensed liquor estab
lishments in and around the Rutgers
University New Brunswick campus.
Based onthose findings, detectives pur
sued investigative leads, developing in
formation to target the source of the
counterfeit driver's licenses.
As the investigation progressed,

detectives learned that "operators"
would visit college campuses to solicit
and recruit students who were under 21
years of age. The "operatives" would
inform students that for $100 they
could obtain a New Jersey driver's li
cense-would reflect an age of 21 or
older. After collecting personal informa
tion from each student, the operative
would take the student's photograph
and download the picture into a laptop
computer. The information and photo
graphs were then taken to a personal
residence in Philadelphia where they
were produced.
Once the licenses were completed,
the "operative" would contact the stu
dent host at the college campus. The
collected $100 fees were exchanged for
the licenses.

Armed with this information,
State Police detectives and the Rutgers
Police Department organized a fake
meeting for February 14. The intent was
to take underage photographs at this
meeting. Amongst the students attend
ing were several female undercover
New Jersey State troopers, who arrested
students at the conclusion of the meet
ing. Following the "operative's" arrest,
police seized $57,119 in cash, as well
as sophisticated computer systems, digi
tal cameras, scanners, printers and other
electronic devices. Shortly after, a Phila
delphia storage room was surrendered
to police, where more computer systems
were found, along with counterfeit
laminates, customer lists, New Jersey
driver's licenses and silk screens. The
total value of the confiscated computer
systems is estimated at over $40,000.
Attorney General Verniero said
that state police and the Division of the
Criminal Justice are working to iden
tify additional cash assets and/or prop

College to host panel on
independent counsel

from staff reports
On April 8, the Political
Science department will spon
sor a program concerning the
current political topic of the
Independent Counsel.
The program will explore
questions on separation of
powers between Congress and
the President, the political na
ture of the Independent Coun
sel and the open-ended nature
of its staff, budget, and man
date. The possition of Indepen
dent Counsel was created
through the Ethics and Govern
ment Act of 1978, which was
created due to the numerous
crimes and complications of the
Watergate scandal.

The department chose a
topic about which students
would be enthusiastic. They
wanted to include something
"high profile."
Many high profile guests
will attend the program.
Alexia Morrison, former

Independent Counsel. She ar
gued in the Morrison v. Olson
case in 1988, during which the
Supreme Court decided that
the Independent Counsel was
constitutional.
Janet Mullins was inves
tigated by Independent Coun
sel for allegedly rifling through
President Clinton's passport
during the 1992 presidential
campaign.
Congressman William
Goodling will focus discussion
on issue of separation of pow
ers. Representative Albert
Mansland of Pennsylvania in
troduced legislation for an in
dependent counsel.
Richard Benedetto is a
political columnist for USA
Today who has been covering
the current independent coun
sel controversy with regard to
Kenneth Starr and Monica
Lewinsky.
The program will be held
in College Union Building
Room 260 from 3:00-5:00
p.m.

Up with music, service, and people

by Cara Masucci
Staff Reporter There are many groups
out there who start fighting
against each other over what is
wrong and what is right. We
see it happen all over the world.
There is one group out there,
though, that would like to fo
cus on unity rather than on
separation. This group is called
Up With People. Focusing their
efforts on bringing people to
gether, cooperation among
people worldwide, community
service, and the development of
leadership skills, Up With
People successfully teaches a
lesson in togetherness to every
one they come across. This
weekend they will bring their
message to Gettysburg.

Up With People was
founded in 1965 and became
independent and a nonprofit
organization in 1968. Since
then they have visited more
than 3600 communities includ
ing countries such as France,
Germany, and Japan, on four
continents, as well as many
places within the United States.
Since its establishment, more
than 17,500 people have
worked in Up With People.
Up With People is made
up of approximately 110-150
students, ages 17-25, who par
ticipate in the year-long excur
sion. According to the Up With

People event coordinator of
North America, Heather Rush,
students convene in Denver,
Colorado, the World Head
quarters of Up With People,
for six weeks and learn about
the production. After that they
are off on a ten month travel¬

ing pro
g r a m
that will
take
them
some
where f a r
across t h e
world.
The neat
part
about
this is
that the
partici
pants do
not

know where they are going
until they arrive in Denver!
While on the road, the
students break off and split
into two groups. While one
group travels to one area, the
other most likely performs in
a country clear across the
globe. Up With People gives
performances demonstrating
their musical and dancing abil
ity on stage as well as off.
One of the major facets
of Up With People is doing

community service. In one
year's time, students on a tour
will do 130 days of community
service each year, for an amount
of 500,000 hours total. They
do service in every country to
which they travel. In the United
States they have painted over

graffiti in Los Angeles, made
presentations at schools, and
will continue their service
theme this weekend when they
clean up Devil's Den in
Gettysburg.
Since it is a non-profit or
ganization, Up With People re
lies heavily on the goodness of
people in the areas to which
they travel. Apart from per
forming and community ser
vice, the students also need a
place to stay. In one year com¬

bining the two casts, more than
28,000 host families will be
used in all areas of the world.
A typical student can expect to
stay at between 70-90 host
family homes. This provides a
knowledge of the culture out
side of what is seen on the tour-

With People

former
and member
of thead
v a n c e
team that
sets up
the area
and pub¬

licizes the event before other
performers get there.
Sostheim, from Germany,
was studying medicine when he
decided to take a hiatus and
travel with Up With People.
According to Rush and
Sostheim, this is a typical ex
perience for students on tour
with the cast. It provides a time
of learning and job experience
for students who have not yet
completed their degrees.
There are positions that

are not in the domain of per
formance, but rather in busi
ness management and market
ing, according to both Rush
and Sostheim.
This weekend, the group
will be performing at the
Gettysburg Middle School.
The shows will be at 7 p.m. on
Saturday and 3 p.m. on Sunday.
If anyone is interested in be
coming part of Up With People,
Rush advises they come to
Sunday's performance and set
up an interview.
The interviews are based
entirely on personality, and al
low someone who is hesitant to
decide what is best for them.
Up With People will also have
a table in the CUB on Friday of
this week sponsored by Inter
national Student Affairs.

If anyone is familiar with
Up With People and has seen
the show before, the perfor
mance they have in Gettysburg
this weekend will be an eye
opener. It is an all-new show
entitled "Roads." The show
will tackle the differences be
tween people in every aspect of
life, from age to economic se
curity.
In the end, the people
will come together in the mes
sage of Up With People: in the
end, unity gets a person farther
than hatred or violence. That
is a message heard around the
world.


Puzzling Putnam proves possible

by Melodie Foster
Assistant Features Editor
Despite the public service
announcements on the radio
that portray students chanting
for "al-ge-bra" outside of their
advisor's office, many students
today still run in fear from
courses such as calculus, linear
algebra, and differeniial equa
tions like they would from a
rabid dog or the bubonic
plague.
Mathematical skill has
become increasingly important
in today's technological society,

however, and Gettysburg Col
lege has kept up with the
trends by providing students
with a strong math department
that can hold its own in the
face of outside competition.
Every year, a number of
colleges and universities par
ticipate in a competition
known as the Putnam exam.
The Fifty-Eighth Annual
Putnam Competition took
place on Saturday, December
6, 1997. Gettysburg College
was represented by seniors Ja
son G. Smith and Jim Booth,
and by juniors Jay Henniger,

Andy Danner, Akbar Rizvi, and
Martin Wayne.
This year's competition
was successful for Gettysburg
for two more reasons. Junior
physics/math majors Danner
and Henniger were among the
highest scoring finalists.
Danner scored ten points, and
Henniger scored an amazing 18
points, placing him in the top
20 percent of all participants.
The 2510 participants
were given six hours to solve 12
extremely difficult math prob
lems. The exam was given in
two three-hour segments, one

in the morning and one in the
afternoon. Each problem was
worth ten points, giving a pos
sible point total of 120.
Only 16 students, seven
of whom are from Harvard, the
number one university in the
United States according to this
year's US News and World Re
port evaluation, scored more
than 60 points.
To be ranked in the top
twenty percent, participants
needed a score of thirteen or
higher. The mean score for all
contestants was the usual zero,
according to Assistant Profes¬

sor of Mathematics Bela
Bajnok.
Harvard placed first in
the competition, followed by
Duke, Princeton, MIT, and
Washington University, in that
order. Gettysburg's team
ranked an excellent 130th, the
school's all-time highest rank
ing. The College placed 139th
last year. Only one other small
college from Pennsylvania,
Swarthmore College, the US
News and World Report pick
for the number one liberal arts
college in the United States,
ranked above Gettysburg.


A quilt of psychology, travel, children, and life

by Andrea Quarracino
Contributing Reporter
When a student thinks of
the word "professor", a very
one-sided image often comes to
mind. For some reason many
students have a difficult time
perceiving that their teachers
have lives outside of the class
room. In reality, professors pos
sess a wealth of knowledge just
because they are not one-sided
individuals.
Martha Arterberry is a
fantastic example of a woman

who goes far beyond being a
professor. During the eight
years she has spent teaching at
Gettysburg College, she has
managed to actively pursue a
career in science, and maintains
many of her diverse interests as
well. Arterberry studies the sci
ence of perception in young
children. Her research focuses
on learning about what aspects
of perception are inborn ver
sus what aspects of perception
are learned, something known
to psychologists as the nature/
nurture debate. Through her

work in the Infant and Child
Study Center at Gettysburg
College, Arterberry studies
young children to try to deter
mine the answer to these ques¬

tions. Arterberry makes it very
clear that her studies are in
tended only to address very
specific questions. "I am look
ing at the perceptual abilities of
the child," she said. "I don't
study intelligence. Nothing I
am doing tells me about how
smart a child will be or what
they will become."
One might wonder what
would inspire an individual to
pursue this particular field of
study. As it turns out, as an un
dergraduate Arterberry held
strong interests in both chil
dren and art. Having attended
art classes throughout her
childhood, studies on art per
ception always caught her in
terest. But it was not until her

college years that she discov
ered her love for the baby lab.
Arterberry grew up in
southern California, and at
tended Pomona College in her
home state. Pomona College
has an exchange program that
allows students to study at
other universities, one of which
was Swarthmore College in
Pennsylvania. Arterberry spent
a year at Swarthmore as a vis
iting student, and while there,
volunteered her time in the

baby laboratory. It was there
that she discovered how her
love for art and children could
be combined in studies on how
babies perceive the third di¬

.
In 1983, Arterberry
graduated from Pomona Col
lege with a Bachelor of Arts
degree in psychology, and went
on to see about pursuing her
dreams.
Finally, her diligence paid
off and she received an answer
from a laboratory in Minne
sota. Working in this laboratory
for a year became an extremely
positive experience, so
Arterberry went on to gradu
ate school at the University of
Minnesota and graduated with
a doctorate in Child Psychol
ogy- After graduate school,
Arterberry wanted to find a job
that would allow her to com
bine teaching and research. She
also found the atmosphere of a
small, liberal arts school ap
pealing. In 1989, Arterberry
came to Gettysburg College.

While teaching,
Arterberry likes to keep her stu
dents up to date on the latest
scientific advances in her field.
This benefits both the students
and the teacher at the same
time, as the students are con
stantly immersed in current sci
ence while the teacher can keep
up with research.

Though she has "only
been a scientist for eight years,"
Arterberry told me about a
book that she has co-authored
with a fellow scientist from the
University of California in Los
Angeles. The Cradle of Knowl
edge by Kellman and Arterberry
has been a project in the mak
ing since 1990, and is now due
for publication in 1998.
When Arterberry is not
teaching, conducting experi
ments, or writing, she is pur
suing some of her other inter
ests, one of which is quilting.
Travel is something else
that has caught Arterberry's
attention. She was the 1996
resident director of the
Gettysburg College Interdisci
plinary Study Abroad program
in England, teaching a course
at the University of Essex, and
while in England was able to
work in trips to Scotland and
Spain as well.
It is evident that

Arterberry is a person with
many interests, and has man
aged to lead a successful career
life while staying actively in
volved in the things she loves
to do. Arterberry is certainly the
picture of someone who has
achieved her career goals, in
every aspect of the word.
This is the third in a se
ries of profiles of professors in
science-oriented fields.

The basics on rape defense

by Julia Fallon and Sally Vater
Contributing Reporters
Acquaintance rape ac
counts for 78% of all rapes.
Date rape is the most
underreported type of sexual
assault. According to the U.S.
Department of Justice in 1996,
less than one in every three in
cidents is reported. Women
typically elect not to report
rape because they believe it to
be a personal matter and be
cause they fear retaliation by

their attacker.
There is a strong correla
tion between alcohol consump
tion and date rape, particularly
on college campuses. Seventy
five percent of male students
and fifty-five percent of female
students involved in date rape
are under the influence of
drugs and alcohol. Using drugs
and alcohol can make a woman
more susceptible to date rape
because alcohol impairs judge
ment and decreases motor
skills, which are necessary in

order to assess a dangerous
situation, and have the ability
to escape. A man's judge
ment is also altered as a re- M
suit of using drugs and al- w 1
cohol, so he may misinter- \]
pret signals, and may be- j
come more sexually ag- i\
gressive or even violent. m\
In order to avoid M
date rape, there are some M I
warning signs that may in- f I
dicate a potentially harm- 1 I
ful scenario. Women t J
should be concerned if a M ,
man talks over her, ignores 1
her, or does not show re-
\ t
spect for her personal _K \ *
space. Jp
Experts provide a set W
of suggestions advising 1
women what to do if they ,
are in a date rape situanon. J *
First, it is important to stay \ *
calm, evaluate the situa- *
tion, and consider your

tions. Next, a woman must
decide if it is safe to resist.
Women who fight off their at
tacker have a better chance of

escaping rape. However, the
likelihood of success dimin¬

ishes it the attacker is armed.
Authorities say that if the at
tacker is armed, the victim
should employ passive resis
tance. This entails attempting

to talk him out ot it or distract
ing him, to create an opportu
nity to escape. It is impor
tant to make your feelings
known to the rapist. Ada
mant use of the word, "NO"
makes it clear that you do
not want to have sex. It may
help to use the word "rape."
Hearing this word might
shock the rapist into realiz
ing he is committing a crime,
and may prevent the rape
from occurring.
The best way of fight¬

ing off an unarmed aggres
sor is to get physical. Punch
ing, kicking, and scratching
are ways to fend off an at
tacker. It can also be help
ful to lie to him. For ex
ample, telling him that you
have a sexually transmitted
disease or indicate that you
are expecting someone to
come at any time. Instead of
)ust shouting, "Help 1 " a victim
should shout "Fire!" because
most people will not respond
to a plea for help because they

don't want to meddle in other
people's affairs. Fire concerns
everyone, and people are more
likely to call for help.
If a rape occurs, the vic
tim should go to the hospital
immediately. There, physical
evidence will be taken and the
victim will be treated for inju
ries and possible STDs. Some
typical reactions to the trauma
of rape include mood swings,
detachment, abnormal sleeping
patterns, and changes in appe
tite. For student victims of

rape, these effects result in dif
ficulty concentrating, which
leads to poor academic perfor
mance.
A number of organiza
tions are available to provide
support for women who are
victims of rape. The Rape,
Abuse, and Incest National
Network (RAINN) has a toll
free hotline. Victims and
friends can dial 1-800-656
HOPE (1-800-656-4673) for
assistance in dealing with the
repercussions of rape.

I was fascinated by the
fact that this is a true story, and
if you do go see it, the scenes
from a documentary on the

season upon us, a good film to
get into the mood with is The
Fan. Starring Wesley Snipes (To
Wo>ig Foo, Thanks for Every
thing ] -Julie Newmar, Demoli
tion Man) and Robert DeNiro
(Wag the Dog, Raging Bull), The
Fan delves into the complicated
and delicate relationship be
tween fans and players.
Recently acquired by the

In Case You Missed It

San Francisco Giants, local
hero Bobby Rayburn (Snipes)
is psyched for a pennant. A
.300 hitter for the Braves, Gi
ants fans are expecting big
things of Rayburn.
The season starts off with
controversy. Rayburn's num
ber is already taken by left
fielder Juan Pnmo (Benicio del
Toro). Pnmo won't give the
number up, and is still bitter
that Rayburn has replaced him
at centerfield. During the
home opener, Rayburn and

Pnmo collide in the outheld,
and Rayburn is injured. He
keeps playing anyway and has
a great game. It looks like the
Giants are off to the start ot a
great season, and hopes for the

pennant are high.
After his in
jury, Rayburn hits a
slump. The fickle
fans become angry
that the franchise
spent $40 million
on a player who
can't even hit the
ball. Rayburn be
comes more and
more frustrated and
blames his bad
patch on not having
his mimher. He

tries again to get the number
from Primo, but he won't give
it up, taking back the offer to
sell it to Rayburn.
But one dedicated fan
stays with him all along. Gil
Renard (DeNiro), a knife sales
man, has been a fan of Rayburn
since the days when he played

locally. He is as excited when
Rayburn joins the Giants. Gil
talks constantly about the days
when he was a player, and
shares the opinion of a lot of
people that baseball players

have forgotten about the fans, people think of Bobby
They shouldn't play for them- Rayburn, Gil wants people to

selves because it is the fans who
make baseball great. Gil takes
baseball very seriously. To him,
baseball is better than life be
cause after all, baseball is the
only fair thing out there.
Life hasn't been very fair

to Gil lately. Around the time
Rayburn's slump starts, Gil hits
his own bad patch. He loses
his job and his ex-wife gets a
restraining order to keep him
away from their son. Gil's ob¬

session with the
game drives him
to the brink of
madness. He
wants to be the
one to set
Rayburn's game
right again. Gii
and his hero's
paths cross a few
times, and then
Gil makes him
self an important
part of Rayburn's
life. Whenever

think of him.
DeNiro gives a convinc
ing performance of a man on
the verge of a breakdown.
What makes DeNiro's perfor
mance such a good one is that
you can actually witness Gil's

progression into madness.
Snipes portrays a cocky athlete
almost naturally. This film is
very dark, and at some parts
very surprising, but in the end
it all comes together.
Ellen Barkin (The Big
Easy, Dtner) and John
Leguizamo (To Wong Foo,
Thanks for Everything! -Julie
Newmar, Romeo & Juliet) pro
vide some comic relief with
their constant bickering.
Barkin plays an in-your-face
sports radio talk show host try
ing to get an interview with the
superstar. Leguizamo plays
Manny, Rayburn's manager
and close friend.
Another face that you
might recognize is ex-Philadel
phia Philhe John Kruk as one
of the Giants.

The Fan is a psychologi
cal thriller and the plot is full
of twists and turns. It is a very
suspenseful and enjoyable film.
It's not your typical baseball
movie, but then again, Gil
Renard isn't your typical fan.

CONFLICT & Consensus
Town meetings, air conditioning, stuck-up people, etc.

by Michael Petro
Opinionated Editor
You didn't ask for it, but
dammit, you are all going to get
it again! That's right campers,
due to yet another lack of print
able material I must subject you
to another installment of "Free
Floating Hostility."
My apologies to all of you
optimists out there but, well, it
is the wee hours of the morn
ing and that tends to bring out
the hostility in all of us, espe
cially me.
So what's bothering me
this week? The list is long, yet
undistinguished.
Let's start with April
Fool's Day. What a disappoint
ment! Did anyone hear of any
significant pranks or worth
while capers? I know I didn't.

The only significant effort at
some amusement came from
this publication. That's right
folks, that _Gettysburgian Extra
section is a joke.
And furthermore, why
the heck wasn't the fountain
on? After all, one of the clas
sic pranks on this campus is for
someone to throw detergent in
there and watch all the fun.
Now, I am not advocating any
kind of destructive behavior on
this campus, we all know our
drunken classmates do enough
of that, however, a little good
hearted humor and chicanery
would have lifted everyone's
spirits as we prepare for the
end-of-semester push. So to all
you pranksters out there, you
blew it! Better luck next year!
How about this nice
weather? It was certainly time

to get past the rain and into
some sunshine and blue skies.
I know that 1 enjoyed the warm
weather and hope that it is here
to stay. However, why is it that
the air conditioning hasn't been
turned on in the buildings? I
have heard that there is an of
ficial policy about not turning
it on before a certain date and
that is the reason why you lose
ten pounds in water weight at

Musselman library. Let's be
practical here people! The _^
air conditioning is there j/*
for a purpose, to cool _^r
a building when it is jf
hot! At least turn /

it on in the li
brary! Appar
ently the
bean count
ing penny
pinchers of
this college
have no con
ception of
what heat
can do to
books.
As for
me, well, all I
can say is
that I am sure
glad Ice
House is air
conditioned
indepen
dently in
each unit!

Another thing that really
gets to me is this wholehearted
embracing of the town meet
ing. Today at 11:30 in the CUB
ballroom there will be another
of these town meetings spon
sored in part by the office of
the president. Don't they real
ize that these things won't
work?! Democracy isn't sup
posed to operate in its purest
form. Quite the contrary, the
only way for democracy to
work is to have a small group
making all the real decisions,
which, given this college's track
record, will probably happen
anyway. So in actuality, what
am I complaining about?
While I think that it is
absolutely lovely that the ad
ministration thinks enough of

the campus community to ask
the important question about
a new performing arts building
versus a new science building,
what it amounts to is that the
powers that be will do what
ever they damn well please. So
thanks anyway, but this dog
doesn't chase those bones.
So anyone mad yet? Well

maybe this will get your atten
tion. To all of the stuck up
people on this campus, those
who throw around the "I pay
$30,000 a year to come
here" ex cuse every time some
thing goes wrong, or who
throw trash around expecting
the hard working men and
women of Facilities Services to
clean it up, and who ridicule
Safety and Security for its fire
alarm response time, I say
SHUT THE HELL UP AL
READY!
I am sick of the fact that
college-aged students lament
that they get treated like chil
dren, yet, back it up day in and
day out. Grow up! Have we
declined so much or were we
taught so badly by our parents

that respect is gone? There are
a lot of hard working people
on this campus, people who
help us grow, mature, and suc
ceed, and there is a portion of
the population that treat them
like dirt. Try this for a change,
treat people with respect and
courtesy and see what happens.
You might be surprised at the
outcome.

And finally, let
me talk a little
about silence.
Every day
there are
those of us
who go
k about

I in si
Wtfr lence. I
know that here

Dole worth seeing

by Cammie Grant
Columnist Bob Dole will be on the
Gettysburg College campus
Monday, April 13. A private
lecture will be held in the af
ternoon followed by a private
dinner. He will then address
the public in the CUB ballroom
at 7:30 in the evening.
Dole's appearance on
campus provides an opportu
nity for all students to hear a
prominent public figure speak

about the current politics by
which we are all effected. Dole
is a former United States sena
tor, and he has held a position
as majority leader and was a
presidential candidate in the
last election. He is also a dis
tinguished war hero. Clearly,
his credentials are nothing
short of acceptable. He is a
leader and has done a lot for
our government and our coun
try. Dole is also the 1995 re
cipient of the Eisenhower
I.eadershin Pri7.e.

Personally, I can't imag
ine why every single member
of the college community
wouldn't attend his lecture.
Many do not support Dole and
some disagree strongly with
him. However, he is a high
profile figure, a leader in the
Republican Party, and an out
standing, experienced, and in
telligent speaker.
In 1996, during his presi
dential campaign, he spoke to
a fairly large crowd at the Colo
rado Convention Center. He

is a charismatic speaker and a
true patriot of the United States
of America. He takes enor
mous pride in our country and
has served it in many ways. I
believe that since the college
has brought in an important
political figure that everyone
who is able, should attend.
Gettysburg College is a fairly
conservative school and we
should welcome Dole with
open arms. We should be hon
ored to be able to host such a
nrominent leader.


CONFLICT & Consensus
Talk about the weather

by Christina Dickert
Columnist "Isn't the weather beau
tiful?" That is all I heard from
students walking around cam
pus earlier this week. Yeah, I
guess it was if you actually
LIKE the heat. As for me, I
think I am going to move to
Alaska after I graduate. Take
spring break for example—I
didn't go to some tropical place
like Jamaica, but I went home
to the temperate Lehigh Valley
PA. (I guess money was a bit
of a factor in that decision.) As
for the beautiful weather, I
think it stank unless you could
enjoy it.
I guess you can say I did
enjoy it. I mean, I guess I got a
bit of a tan as I walked past the
quad (where everyone from
Musselman, Patrick, Hanson,
Huber, and Stevens was having
fun) to what seems to be my

favorite place on the campus,
Musselman Library. Remem
ber how we got that email ear
lier on in the week saying that
the library has seen more
people in the past week than
any other week this semester?
Well, sorry to disappoint you
library fans, but it was basically
empty after 9:00 on Monday
night. It might be because the
library was an absolute sauna.
Maybe it's just me, but for
$30,000 a year, I think we de
serve air conditioning in our
library. I mean, doesn't our
college want us to study? That
is the whole point of college,
isn't it? (Well, that could be
debated...) But, no, those of
us who want to dedicate our
selves to our work are punished
with the sweltering heat. Seri
ously, you would be a fool to
go above the second floor be
cause the heat was unbearable.

I also live in one of the
privileged dorms that actually
has air conditioning. Or do
we? When I tried to turn it on,
no air came out. The heater
was turned off too. Where did
the temperature control system
go? Obviously, our loving ad
ministration chose to keep the
bills down with no heat or no
air conditioning.
What will happen if it
does get cold again?
Well, as I've said to my
dormmates as I pass them on
the quad, I will just have to be
content with staying pasty
white until school is over. Let's
look at the benefits— I won't
be at risk to develop cancer, I
won't be smelling like coconut
suntan lotion, and I won't have
to worry about getting hit in
the head with the Frisbee.

But, now, as I once again
head out the door to the library
that sure does sound like fun.

Ode to the students

by Rick Deutsch
Columnist This is the time of year at
Gettysburg College when the
campus undergoes a major
facelift. New trees are im
ported then planted, brown
patches of grass are attended
to, and litter is only a rumor.
With Get Acquainted Day ap
proaching fast, the advertising
strategies are set forth to ensure
things run smoothly for the
twenty four hours the incom
ing freshmen and their parents
spend on campus.
If they fall in love with
the beauty of the campus,
maybe the parents will feel bet
ter about leaving their sons and
daughters on their own for the
first time. Maybe they will be
so impressed, they'll try to con
vince younger brother Johnny
to come here as well. Maybe

they won't think about the
twenty eight thousand they're
shelling out each year. All good
things for Gettysburg College.
But the most underesti
mated aspect that serves as a
surefire way to draw parents
and incoming students alike to
Gettysburg, is us, the students.
I'm not referring to our ami
able comportment or bright
smiles, just our presence. Take,
for example, this past week. At
any point in the day, on any
lawn on campus, there were
numerous students taking part
in a variety of Spring Fever
events. Frisbee tosses, tanning
sessions, (studying?), rolling
around in the grass with dogs.
Essentially, everyone was hav
ing fun.

For the majority of high
school seniors, when they come
to visit the campus and see
what their college is all about,

that is what they want to see.
It serves as reassurance that
they're not going to spend their
entire college experience bur
ied under books in the library
(so no thanks to those of you
who were actually doing work
out there). And conversely,
when the parents of those kids
see that their children are
happy, they too are reassured
about the cost, effort, and stress
involved in searching for the
right school. All good things
for Gettysburg College.
So when those incoming
freshmen are here in April,
don't worry yourselves over
trying to be extra friendly and
smiling at all the parents (that
should be hard). Just get out
there with a towel, some SPF
15, a frisbee, maybe a book or
two to impress, and enjoy your
selves.

Consider this

As this week's edition of
The Gettyburgian will attest,
there are a number of problems
of major proportions currently
plaguing the campus community.
A giant elephant attacked
and devastated a large portion
of the campus, and severely
wounded several administrators
and faculty members. And how
does the College respond to such
horrible actions? By rewarding
these animals with equal status
with human students.
A huge prehistoric mon
ster is skulking around unsuper
vised in the Quarry. The admin
istration and so-called "experts"
continue to turn their backs to
this creature, and use big words
like "extinct" to try to keep the
population from panicking. Are
these people blind? We have
photographic evidence in this
very issue.

A nudist special interest
house will be opening in August.
Is the College prepared for the
backlash that this program will
generate, both from members of
the community and money-giv
ing alumni? To what lengths are
we as institution willing to go in
order to promote and protect
free expression, in all it's forms?
The administration also
seems to believe that it has the

power to purchase property that
is of extreme importance to the
community. Did anyone think
to assess the impact of taking
Wal-Mart away from the Gettys
burg community?
And on the national front,
cows have invaded Montana.
How long can we turn a blind
eye to this problem before it be
comes a reality here in Gettys
burg? The needs of the local
bovine population have gone
neglected for far too long. The
pastures of Gettysburg are a
powderkeg ready to explode.
These issues are of serious
importance and the Gettysburg
College community cannot con
tinue to ignore them. Far too
often, issues and policies that
drastically effect the student
body are implemented under our

noses. We would like to issue a
call to arms to the campus com
munity to confront these prob
lems, and make this a college
that we're proud to call our own.
Resolution of these issues
will not come easily, and not
without some conflict. In the
midst of this battle to retake the
campus for the student body, we
must never forget to lose our
most important asset, our sense
of humor.

Wal-Mart falls victim to College expansion

by Bruce Wayne
Contributing Reporter
Gettysburg College pur
chased the local Wal-Mart last
week in a not so surprising
move. When asked what the
College plans to do with the
superstore, several options
were listed.
College spokesperson
Kevin Young cited upperclass
men student housing or a new
bookstore as "options under
consideration. We plan to
incoporate the Wal-Mart build
ing into the College by the fall
semester."
The housing crisis has
been a significant concern for
the College, and with nearby
hotels and apartment com
plexes becoming scarce, Get
tysburg College decided to look
elsewhere for places to house
students.

If the College does decide on the Future, the Task Force

Wal-Mart will be integrated into the Gettysburg College campus by the fall of 1998

to use Wal-Mart as housing, the
battlefield tour trolleys will also

facilities could be located in the

The other possible use for
the superstore is an extensive
college bookstore. This would
drastically change the Wal
Mart look. "All NASCAR mer
chandise will be replaced with
J.Crew, and the small snack bar
will become a Starhnck's

coffehouse," said Young.
Wai Mart's financial
problems prompted the pur
chase. Wal-Mart spokesperson
Jermaine Allensworth gave sev
eral reasons for the store's re
cent decline. "Wal-Mart's main
consumer market is college stu
dents, slack-jaw yokels and
tourists. We just don't have that
kind of market here.
"Also, Wai Mart has been
unable to compete with Col
lege Bookstore prices. If we
offered pencils for $4.50, we
would be broke within a
week."
Gettysburg High School
also prompted the purchase. "It
would be embarrasing if the
College campus were smaller
than the high school," Young
said.

The College and Wal
Mart have developed a good
working relationship during
the recent elephant crisis (see
story, page 14).


Co-ed naked special interest

by Dick Grayson
Contributing Reporter
A new special interest
house, devoted to supporting
the lifestyle, values, and ideals
of nudists will open at Gettys
burg at the start of the 1998 fall
semester.
The "Natural Living"
house was formed after a great
deal of interest was expressed
to the College. According to
program coordinator Arthur
Curry, "students have been ask
ing for this for a long time."
The Natural Living
House, located on North Wash
ington Street, is a twostory
building with eight two-person
apartments.
Men will occupy the first
floor, women the second.

According to Curry, the
house has already had more
than twenty-five applicants to
fill the sixteen available spaces.
"This just goes to show the

huge demand for a program
like this on campus," he said.
Students living in the
house will be required to be
nude at all times, as will all
guests to the residence as well.
Curry stated that while this
might be uncomfortable for
some visitors, "It is part of the
mission of the house to make
our conservative society con
front some of the issues it has
with human nudity."
As part of the special in
terest housing program, the
Natural Living House will be
required to sponsor a number
of all-campus events each year
designed to increase awareness
of their cause. Events currently
planned for next semester in
clude an all-nude dance party
and a raffle.
When asked if the pro
gram has encountered any op
position, Curry said, "there
have been a few members of a
highly vocal minority who have

don't appreciate what we're
trying to do here." He did state
that the administration and
many prominent campus orga
nizations have been "highly
supportive."
"I did get a whole string
of emails calling me a pervert,"
he said. "What people don't
realize is that being a nudist has
nothing to do with sex. It is a
lifestyle that celebrates freedom
and appreciates the beauty and
grace of the human body in all
its many shapes and sizes."
Curry added that many
other colleges and universities
in the country have discussed
the idea of nudist special-inter
est housing, but Gettysburg will
be the first to implement such
a program.

Students who live in the
house will still be required to
be fully clothed when they
leave the residence. This is due
mainly to certain Pennsylvania
statutes that discourage public

nudity.
"The College is light-

years ahead of the rest of the
world in that regard," said
Curry.

Giant elephant terrorizes campus

by B. Abar
Contributing Reporter
Clean-up efforts are get
ting underway today after a gi
gantic elephant leveled several
academic buildings and faculty
yesterday.
Some time early Wednes
day morning, the giant grey el
ephant-more a relative of the
extinct wooly mammoth than
the familiar circus animal we
have all come to love-stormed
across campus, leaving devas
tation and chaos in its wake.
The beast, thought to have
been released from the wild
animal cage at Wal-Mart,
trampled cars and homes along
Route 30 en route to the col
lege. This marks the third time
in as many years that the col
lege has faced a giant animal
disaster. Administrators were
unavailable for comment, due
to the effects of elephant tram
pling.

Upon arriving, the grey
monstrosity began to nibble on
portions of the CUB, as well as
on students fleeing the area.
Apparently dissatisfied with the
taste of the Union building, the
elephant became angry and
reared on its hind feet. Stunned

at this almost ridiculous display
of acrobatics by a 25-ton crea
ture, students and faculty
looked on in awe as the trunk
waved some 30 stones in the
air. Bystanders indicated that

the gigantic
creature, some
10 to 12 times

A trail of devastation: the elephant seen after razing
Penn Hall.

mendous be
hemoth stalked off angry in the
direction of the college. Profes
sional animal handlers, recently
unemployed from Wal-Mart re
port finding a manifesto on the
elephant's laptop computer,
addressed to the college admin¬

istration entitled "An
Elephant's Right to Educa
tion." Scientists speculate that
this elephant incident is in
someway related to the recent
arrival of a dinosaur named

"Ike" on campus. Animal soci
ologists feel that the arrival of
these ancient creatures may be
a result of discontent among
the populations of nonexistent
creatures. The most likely
causes for such dissatisfaction

may be due to such problems
as "extinction anxiety" and
"large-trunk/neck disorder."
Some propose that integrating
elephant and other creatures of
tremendous carriage into regu
lar society would help alleviate

feelings of inferi
ority. A spokes
man from Penn
Hall has advo
cated trying to
increase animal
diversity on cam
pus. Special in
centives and liv
ing conditions
would be pro
vided for these
nonhuman stu
dents to make
their educational
experience at the
College more
complete. "El
ephants, and
other large
beasts," said the
spokesman "will

help better prepare our gradu
ates for real life. We need to
teach our students how to deal
with these creatures, as they
may find themselves in the
employ of an elephant or simi
lar animal sometime down the

road." After some time police
and campus elephant trainers
were able to bring the behe
moth under control. Negotia
tors from the Capital were
brought in to see to the
elephant's demands. The el
ephant and the negotiators sat
down inside of Glatfelter
Lodge to discuss plans for add
ing an elephant population to
the school. College officials
cited the high costs of includ
ing elephants and similar beasts
into a liberal arts environment,
using data from Boston College
and Harvard University that
had experimented with similar
programs five years ago. How
ever, talks were stalled when
the elephant threatened to de
stroy one academic building
per hour until its demands were
met.

Eventually, with repair
and reconstruction costs
mounting, the College suc
cumbed to the demands of the
elephant. Tentative plans, once
all buildings have been restored
to their former state, are to
build a large new "Elephant
and Non-Human" residence
hall, to be located in the Fresh
man quad between Paul and
Rice halls.


College gives nod to homogeneity

by Lauren Hilversace
Contributing Reporter
In an effort to jump on
the bandwagon of the new
trend in American high schools,
Gettysburg College has an
nounced that it will institute a
school uniform policy for the
1998-99 academic year.
Sighting the recent rise in
crime stats and an increase in
overall insubordination on
campus, a Commission on the
Future subcommittee, known
as "The Committee to Seize
and Throttle Free Thought and
Independence" has come up

with the following dress code.
For the men, the dress
code will be as follows. In the
warmer months, that is, August
through October, as well as
April and May, male students
will be required to wear the fol
lowing: Plain front khaki trou
sers, white button down shirt
with oxford collar, navy blue
blazer, Gettysburg College or
ange and blue tie, and appro
priate footwear (pennyloafers
are suggested). In the winter,
the trousers must be gray and
a sweater vest is an optional
accessory. Boots of an appro
priate style and color will also
be acceptable during inclement

weather.
The women are required
to wear knee length or longer
tan skirts without pleats, white
blouse with all buttons done,
orange and blue scarf, navy
blue blazer, and two-inch black
platforms or heels. Stockings
are optional but strongly rec
ommended and must coordi
nate appropriately with the re
quired attire. Furthermore,
jewelry will be limited to no
more than two earrings per ear,
one ring per hand, a single
chain for the neck and one
bracelet or watch per wrist.
Visible piercings anywhere else
are prohibited.

Hats are not permitted
for either the men or the
women, and the display of
Greek letters is limited to ei
ther a cuff or collar monogram
no larger than 1/4" by 1/4" per
letter. Given the College's his
torically high volume of orders
to J. Crew, an agreement has
been reached with the com
pany to provide the uniforms.
The College Apparel Special
Catalogue will be mailed to all
returning student sometime be
fore the end of June. Be sure
to place orders early and re
member to fill out the college
code 434 on each order so the

appropriate Gettysburg Col
lege emblems can be affixed.
Students in need can ap
ply for uniform financial aid by
phoning x6449.
The faculty and adminis
tration will enforce violations
of the dress code. Punishments
will include suspension, expul
sion, and monetary fines for
offenders.
An anonymous adminis
tration official leaves us with
this thought: "Students here at
Gettysburg are always pointing
out the homogeneity of the
campus. To them I say, you
want homogeneity you've got
homogeneity!"

Jurassic pond found on campus

by Eddie Maple
Contributing Reporter
On Saturday, March 27,
two students, who have asked
to remain anonymous, were
walking near the quarry when
a "damn big, prehistoric crea
ture rose from the pond." The
students quickly fled the scene
and reported the incident to
campus officials.
However, before fleeing,
the two eyewitnesses involved
in this sighting were able to
take a photograph of the crea
ture, thus providing a piece of
concrete evidence to support
their claims.
This is reportedly not the
first such episode on campus.
Over the past century numer
ous reports of "strange howl
ing sounds" near the quarry
have been filed, and many eye
witnesses have come forward.
The creature has even curried
a name around campus: Ike the

no way that any large, prehis
toric creature is in the quarry,
either alive or dead!" At this
point, the professor refused any
further questions.
This may be a sound sci
entific view, but until the dis
covery of a prehistoric fish off
of the coast of Madagascar the

Icthyosaur.
One of the most well
known of these past incidents
involved a now retired profes
sor. Allegedly, Professor Edith
Scotch was walking her pet
poodle near the pond, and
when she put her back to the
water in order to tie her shoe,
she heard her pet yelp once.
She immediately investigated
and found her poodle, Killer,
dead. She also reported seeing
a "large shape moving under
the water."
Mrs. Scotch commented
on the current sighting, "That
whole pond should be loaded

scientific wor d beheved these

with explosives and blown
up...and I want to be the one
to push the button!"
When questioned about
the plausibility of a prehistoric
animal possibly living in the
quarry, Biology professor Dr. L.
Ness commented, "That is the
most preposterous thing I have
ever heard! There is absolutely

creatures to be extinct. Could
a similar event be unfolding in
Gettysburg?
Even with many recorded
incidents, facts mounting, and
now photographic proof, these
accounts have been consistently
viewed as fictional. The admin
istration was unavailable for
comment on this issue at the
time of press due to elephant
trampling (see story, page 14).
One of the witnesses said
of the reported creature, "It
was enormous, but I don't
think it wanted to hurt us. It
appeared almost friendly." This_,
student is currently receiving

For years reports of a creature in the quarry pond have been
pouring in. Finally, we have proof.

therapy to aid in overcoming
the trauma of the experience.
Psychologist warn that extreme

and/or benign.

Sports Spotlight
Draft fans Woods' fire

by Clark Kent
Contributing Writer
Who says Division III is
inferior? You can't tell that to
John Woods.
He came to Gettysburg to
play baseball and has opened
the eyes of many major league
scouts. In fact, the same scouts
who discovered talent like Ken
Griffey, Jr. and Alex Rodriguez
are dubbing Woods, "the best
raw talent in the nation."
Woods has put together
some impressive numbers. Be
sides going 18 for 37 (.486 av
erage) on the team's recent trip
to Florida, he also has four
homeruns in just 17 games. He
leads the Bullets in stolen bases,
and is tops in the Centennial

Conference in every offensive
statistical category.
Hey, who wouldn't want
that kind of stuff on their team?
Heck, if Woods is taken by the
Phillies in the first round of
J une's free-agent draft, he
could make an immediate im
pact on their lineup. The
Phillies could use somebody
who could hit anything...not to
mention four homeruns in only
17 games.
If Woods hits four hom
ers every 17 games, that means
in a 164-game major league
season Woods would be on
pace to hit 39 homeruns. Do
you know how much guys in
the majors make when they hit
39 homers? A lot more money
than any of us will see in our

lifetimes.
Right now, the Phillies,
Angels, Brewers and Athletics
all have the top picks in the up
coming draft. When Woods is
taken in the first round (which
is a definite), he could receive
a hefty paycheck as well as a
huge signing bonus. Many top
notch baseball analysts figure
Woods' first year income to be
around 13-14 million dollars
per season, signing bonus not
included.
All in all Woods is look
ing at making more for eight
months of work, than if all of
us would make if we worked
for the rest of out pitiful lives,
and beyond our deaths.
When asked about his
new found fame a remarkably

decisive Woods replied, "I just
want to play ball. Where ever
1 play is fine. Although, I don't
really like the cold and big cit
ies bother my sinuses, my mom
wants a house near the beach,
and my dad wants a home sta
dium where I can hit lots of
homeruns. Does that narrow
it down?"
It was rumored that the
Mariners were prepared to
trade Ken Griffey Jr. to the
Phillies, in order to get the
number one pick to take
Woods.
"We have a ton of confi
dence in the kid's talent," said
Manners General Manager Bill
Bongo, "We'd even trade one
of the best players in the his
torv ot baseball to get him. We

want Woods bleeding Mariner
blue next season."
Hey, take it for what you
will, but John Woods is the real
deal. He combines the speed
and grace of a fuel-injected rab
bit with the power of a herd of
water buffalo and a smile that
charms anyone to make the
league's most sought after pros
pect since Mickey Mantle.
So you ask, if a tree falls
in the "Woods" and nobody is
there to hear it, does it still
make a noise? Well, this Woods
is making noises all over Get
tysburg and all over America.
So with all his talent, new
found fame, and a truck load
of cash, "J-WOO" as his team
mates call him, will be smiling
all the way the bank.


Cows seize Montana government
Armed cows look to South Dakota, California as next targets

by Harriet Olstein
Contributing Reporter
A herd of over one mil
lion cows overran the state of
Montana on Monday, taking
over the town and state govern
ments. The cows will allegedly
move east through South Da
kota and southwest through
Idaho to California this week.
The residents of Mon
tana, outnumbered by the cows
by over three-to-one, surren
dered to the angry herd early
Monday morning after a group
of five cows took Governor
Marc Racicot hostage. The
cows, each armed with an uzi,
held the governor at his home.
The state legislature held
a special session to decide upon
a course of action. The cows
sent a representative to the ses
sion to give the demands for
Racicot's release.

"We demand that the
government be turned over to
us immediately," interpreted
Lewistown resident John
vCatson, who has been in league
with the cows for over a year.
"We outnumber you and our
needs are not being met."

The legislature held a
vote after an hour speech by the
cows, as told by Watson.
Though close, the legislature
voted to turn over the state to
the cows.
"Our economy rests on
those cows," Republican Rep¬

resentative Bob Russell
stated. "We need to keep
them happy."

Against Cow Takeovers
group (DACT), currently work
ing to build up an arsenal to de
fend the state against the cows.
The South Dakota legislature is
currently in session to debate
their plan of action.

In addition, DACT is con
sidering sending a representa
tive to negotiate with the cows.
"We're considering giving them
the Corn Palace in Mitchell in
exchange for them not taking
over our state," said Larson.
California residents,
however, know what they are
going to do once the cows
reach their border. "We're
sending all of the troops from
our Air Force bases to defend
our state. We'll be damned if
some cows are going to take us
over," declared legislator
Patrick Hurley.
The Clinton administra
tion is currently meeting with
the representatives of the en
dangered states to figure out
the best course of action. They
have yet to make a statement
regarding the cow threat.
Cow experts give the fol
lowing advice about contact
with the cows:
1) Do not make eye con
tact. 2) Slowly back away un
til you are out of danger.
3) Do not try to tip the
cow. It will kill you instantly
for the attempt.

On February 18, 1930,
marked the first flight by a cow
in an airplane. Elm Farm's
Olhe, under the gazes of re
porters, parachuted over St.
Louis, Mo. Milk produced
during the flight was later sold.
A cow jumped off a 10
meter cliff onto a major high
way just as a commuter bus was
passing. The driver braked at
the last moment thus avoiding
the cow. The said bovine

landed on the asphalt, did a
parachutist's roll, got up and
continued running. The
stunned passengers got out of
the bus and watched the cow
canter into the sunset. No one
was hurt. This was apparently
not an isolated incident. The
road passes by unfenced graz
ing land, and cows striving for
freedom have made the leap
several times.

For more than three decades, fans have been getting high on the music of Merl Saunders. His repertoire runs the gamut from funk to
blues to rock to jazz, and most recently new age but his audience is not concerned with musical genres; "It's the vibe that counts," he
says. Merl has shared the stage and studio with the likes of Harry Belefonte, Lionel Hampton, B.B. King, Miles Davis, the Statler
Brothers, Paul Butterfield, and of course, his beloved buddy, Jerry Garcia, whom he still lovingly referstto as "Jerome." Even bands like
Phish and Blues Traveler, with whom he frequently jams or sits in, have fallen under the spell of Merl Saunders. Merl's albums "Save
the Planet So We'll Have Some Place to Boogie", "Blues From the Rainforest", and his latest "Fiesta Amizonica" show his dedication to
the environment.

When a band works entirely on its own outside the parameters of current trends, and on a shoestring budget, any accomplishment is seen
as a major one. But, every once in a while, a band comes along that surpasses every expectation, one-ups every industry naysayer and
manages to excel on their own terms. That band is GUSTER.

Bullets shot down by
Hampden-Sydney, 6-5

by Henry Fawell
Assistant News Editor
This past Saturday the
men's lacrosse team dashed all
hopes for a three game winning
streak as they fell to Hampden
Sydney College by the score of
6-5. .
Despite outshooting their
opponent 39-22 in the contest,
the Bullets were unable to rattle
Tigers goalie Scott Ketcham,
who stopped an impressive 22
shots on the afternoon.
"Getting shots off hasn't
been the problem this yearat
all," explained midfielder
Kevin Callahan, "but getting
good shots off has, and Satur
day was a perfect example of
that." The Bullets have outshot
their past two opponents 94
34.

Neither team could build
a solid command all afternoon
as the Scoreboard proved; no
lead ever grew to more than

one goal. The Bullets' five goal
ouput was the lowest total of
the season, even though several
goals were cancelled out by
penalties.
One could say the game
hinged on a freak goal on be
half of Hampden Sydney, as
one of their attackman was able
to bat one of Gettysburg goalie
Andrew Barter's outlet passes
back into the net.
Jamie Bateman led the
Bullets in scoring with two
goals, while Scott Lowery
added two goals and one assist.
Pete Milliman and Callahan
also collected one goal apiece,
and Ross Garretson dished out
two assists.
Hampden Sydney's vic
tory helps the Tigers exact re
venge for several heart-stop
ping losses in recent years.
Three out of the past four
meetings between the two
schools have ended in one goal
victories for the Bullets, includ-

ing last year's 7-6 win in
Farmville, Virginia. Until Sat
urday, the Bullets had won all
six previous meetings between
the two teams.
"I would say they beat us
all over the field," said
midfielder Mark Pollack, "I
think they beat us in
groundballs and defense, they
definitely outhustled us and
they took much better shots.
They should have beat us by
more, but some of their shots
were banging off the pipes."
The loss puts the sixth
ranked Bullets at 3-2 overall.
They will surely drop a few
spots in the rankings, while
eleventh-ranked Hampden
Sydney, who is now 6-1 over
all, will enter the top ten for
the first time this season.

The Bullets will face
Haverford College this
Wednesday before gearing up
for Saturday's game against
fourth ranked Salisbury State.

from The Onmgc and Blue Club
Newsletter It was, a big year tot the
Gettysburg College men's_,
swimming team. Not only did
they complete the regular sea
son with an undefeated record,
but they chopped their titth
Centennial Conference crown
and went on to place twelfth
in the NCAA Division HI cham
pionships out of nearly 50
teams competing. This year's
national event was held in St.
Louis Leading this year's record
performance were the co-cap
tains Pete Casares and Todd
Peters. Casares turned in a time
of 51.02 seconds to place tenth
in the 100-buttertly. He came

Karen Olmstead, Missy West and Kelly Brennan at Nationals

back on the third day to post a
1:54.77 for sixteenth place in
the 200-fIy. By virtue of his
placements, he received All -
American honoiable mention.
He was also clocked in 1:58.17
for the 200-IM, but did not
place in those events.
The two men were |oined
by freshman David Lavigne and
junior Rich Carroll in swim
ming three relays. The four
men placed tenth in the 800
freestyle; 47.27 for the 50-free,
but did not place in those
events.
The emergence of the
men on the national scene place
the team right next to the
women's team.
Sophomore Kelly
Brennan returned to the ranks

of the All-Amencans following
her three days of competition
in the NCAA Division III cham
pionships in St. Lout's, MO.
Brennan captured a
fourth place in her two speci
alities, the 100-butterfly and
the 200-butterfly. She turned
in a 57.82 seconds for the 100
and a 2:08.22 for the 200, both
new school records.
As a result of her perfor
mance, she was named a first
team All-Amencan in both
events. The Bullet sophomore
has been an All-Amencan two
years in a row.

Sophomore Karin
Olmsted and freshman Missy
West also qualified for the
NCAA Championships, but did
not place. Reflecting on her
experiences at Nationals
Olmsted commented, "Al
though I did not swim my per
sonal best times, I learned a lot
and also had a great time. The
three of us grew a lot closer and
had many inside jokes the
whole week. I really missed the
rest of the team being there
with us, it just wasn't the same.
I am definitely ready to step up
and compete next year."



Thanks to young talent
softball is rolling

GCPR Gettysburg College's
softball team posted a 7-1
week, and the tandem of fresh
man pitcher Sara Stokes and
sophomore catcher Karyn
Miller played key roles.
Stokes went the dis ' tance
in the two games she started.
She blanked Juniata 8-0 on a
three-hit shutout and defeated
Swarthmore 4-1 in a Centenial
Conference lid-lifter. The two
decisions were her first of the
season, and she also posted a
0.46 earned run average.
Miller had a big week at
the plate, banging out 13 hits
in 23 at bats for a .565 aver
age. She drove in nine runs in
the strength of four doubles.
Miller is the current team

leader with .568 batting aver
age and a .676 slugging per
centage.
Two other hurlers have
come through for the Bullets
who are 11-4 on the season.
Sophomore Melissa Hazzard
had the second best ERA on the
team at 1.26, while Suzanne
Dailey has jumped to 6.44 de
spite her unblemished record.
Veteran Angle Hoptak,
who ran into trouble early in
the season, has climbed to 2-4
for the year and leads the pitch
ing staff with 10 stikeouts.
The Bullets have pro
duced one of their best hitting
teams in recent years, batting
with a .380 average to date, and
only has three players batting
under .300. Freshman Jen
White is not only the second
leading hitter with a .468 aver-

agej but is also one of the
Gettysburg's most unique de
fensive players.
This starting center
fielder with the speed to cover
a large area of the outfield has
registered 10 assists, most of
them on throws to first base for
a force out. She has handled
the ball 35 times and has been
in on two double plays.
Gettysburg Head Coach
Mike Kirkpatnck seems to have
settled upon a solid defense
which includes White in cen
terfield, senior Traci Bullock in
left field, and senior Mary Beth
Korejko, in right field. Han
dling the infield postions are
junior Erin Kileen at first base,
senior Jill Murphy at second
base, freshman Alyson Adams
at third base and junior Sarah
Graveline at short stop.

Despite skid
freshman Neston
making contribution

by Ronnie Beeman
Contributing Reporter
The Gettysburg Bullet's
baseball team has hit a slide of
late, losing five straight games.
Last Thursday the Bullets
made the journey to Juniata
College. They were down 3-0
after six innings. Bill Beining
gave the Bullets their first hit
of the game. A walk to Brett
Thorp and a single by Drew
Lavenburg allowed Beining to
score and to get the Bullets on
the board. Juniata answered
back with a run in the bottom
of the seventh. The Bullets
were only able to manufacture
one more run in the top of the
ninth and lost 5-2.
On Saturday the Bullets
welcomed Ursinus for two
games. In the first game, the
Bullet's led 3-1 going into the
fifth inning, but the error bug
struck the Bullet's. Three er¬

rors led to three Bear runs in
the inning and handed the Bul
lets a 8-4 defeat. Daryl Clancy
Kevin Grimm, Chris Lunardi_,
and Drew Lavenburg had two
hits in the contest.
The second game did not
change the fortune of the
Bullets. The Bullets were down
10-5 in the bottom of the sev
enth. With one out, John
Woods and Bill Beining hit back
to back home runs to cut the
deficit to 10-7. Three singles
and a walk accounted for the
remaining two runs for the
Bullets. The 10-9 defeat was
almost tied up when Bill
Neston hit a rocked shot to the
right of the second baseman
with a runner on third and two
outs. But the second baseman
made a spectacular play to end
the game.

Tuesday had the Bullets
heading up to Dickinson Col
lege. Once again, the Bullets

were hit with the error bug. n
The Bullets could not over- 1
come a Dickinson six run sec
ond. They rallied in the top of
the ninth with a walk to Bill
Neston, a triple by Jack Tan
ner, and a homerun by John
Woods cut the Bullet deficit to
6 runs. Singles by Bill Beining,
Chris Lunardi, Brett _Fhoip,
and Drew L a v e n b u i g a c -
counted for the final two runs
in a 15- L1 loss.
Bullet outfielder Bill
Neston was named to the Cen
tennial Conference Honor
Role. Neston batted .444 last
week along with the game win-

,

The members of Alpha Lambda Delta (the national honorary
society that honors excellent during a student's first year in
college) congratulate membres of the Class of 1998 elected to
the Gettysburg College chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. Phi Beta
Kappa, founded in 1776, is the oldest Greek-letter society in
America and exists to promote liberal learning, to recognize
academic excellence, and to support and encourage scholars in
their work. Election to Phi Beta Kappa is perhaps the most
widely recognized academic distinction in American higher
education. The first three students listed below were elected in
September 1997 on the basis of their work through six semesters
at Gettysburg College (on junior standing); this is a very high
honor. The remainder were elected in February 1998. Additional
members of the class of 1998 may be elected to Phi Beta Kappa
at the end of the semester.

Sports Weekly
Nordhoff, crew roll past Bryn Mawr, 19-7

by Chris Rippey
Staff Reporter The '98 women's la
crosse team began their season
in the warmth of Panama City,
Florida. They spent
their week conditioning
and fine tuning their
skills in preparation for "~
a successful spring sea
son. While in Florida,
the ladies played their
first game of the season
versus the nationally
ranked Ithaca College.

It was an extremely
close game, but Ithaca
edged out a win with a
score of 9-11.
This Tuesday's
home game was a differ
ent story. The Lady Bul
lets crushed Bryn Mawr
to improve their record
to 4-2. Senior co-cap
tain Chrissy Nordhoff
had an outstanding "
seven goals, while her team
mate Susi Mitchell ripped
three into the net to help Get¬

tysburg conquer Bryn Mawr
with a blowout score of 19-7.
The biggest victory for the
women's lacrosse team thus far
occured last Saturday when
Gettysburg battled the nation¬

ally ranked Ursinus. Nordhoff, who has estab- the victory. Playing every sec

Ursinus with a score of 8-7.
Sophomore Jill MacFarUnd un

play, the second of which was

well, dumping three goals to
help drown out Ursinus.
Freshman goalkeeper Michele
Centrella was on fire that Sat
urday, she had an impressive
10 saves to contain Ursinus for

saves. Senior co-captain Kristin
Sullivan has been an essential
element in the Lady Bullets'
winning season to date. "Sully
is an integral part of our de
fense. She continues to
cause turnovers and
force interceptions in
~™~~~ every game she plays,"
commented assitant
coach Kristen Stuckel.
A large part of the Lady
Bullets' success can be
attributed to her incred
ible defensive skills. A

Ail-American, Sullivan

Local residents fired up over "boorish students"

from staff reports
Gettysburg area residents have
formed an organization to deal with
problems caused by Gettysburg College
students living off-campus.
The organization calls itself the
Hazel Alley Association after the east
ernmost boundary of the district that
covers the area from North Stratton
Street to Mummasburg Street.
The Gettysburg Times, last Friday,
in an article titled "'Town-gown' rela
tionship strained by boorish students,"
reported about the growth of the orga
nization, and the problems caused to the
Gettysburg community by college stu
dents living off-campus.
The Hazel Alley Association
counts among its organizers Professor
Samuel Mudd of the College's Psychol
ogy Department. Mudd is a resident

of the Hazel Alley area and an alumnus
of the College.
The Times reported "Walking
tours of various streets in Gettysburg
show the damaging effect that transient
housing is causing. Garbage piles up,
uncollected. Kegs lay strewn about in
a backyard. A fence is partially knocked
down. A jock strap adorns a wrought
iron banister outside a Water Street
house for weeks."
The Association is concerned that
the students living in the neighborhood
will result in a decrease in property val
ues and a decline of a "family atmo
sphere."
Gettysburg Borough Council
President John Eline told The Times
"I'm afraid we're losing the family at
mosphere on the north end of town,"
and promised to bring the issue before
the town council.

Several houses have gone up for
sale in the area, a fact which The Times
seemingly attributes to the student pres
ence. The College usually allows no
more than 200 students to live off cam
pus. This year, however, due to an in
creased student population and the clos
ing of two fraternity houses, a housing
shortage led to the College granting off
campus housing to a greater number of
students.
Assistant Dean of the College
Dennis Murphy has introduced some
new initiatives to deal with the tension
between students and town resident. A
group of 20 students living off-campus
will be selected to serve are representa
tives of the College within the commu
nity. In addition to being required to
be seniors in good academic standing,

the College has instituted a new policy
that prohibits students with disciplin
ary violations from living off-campus.
This will go into effect for the 1999
housing selection process.
The 1997-98 academic year has
seen a rise in large off-campus parties.
The strict enforcement of The College's
B.Y.O.B. alcohol policy, and an under
age drinking incident that led to the
closing of the Phi Delta Theta house,
may be factors in the increase of the off
campus parties.
Borough residents have com
plained that students frequently ignore
fines levied against them by the borough
police for parking, noise, and trash vio
lations. Though fifty percent of the stu
dent body receives financial aid, many
area residents see this as an instance of
wealthy college students ignoring the
concerns of those around them.

Who will it be?
Identity of graduation speaker still uncertain

by Laura Root
Staff Reporter The Gettysburg College Class of
1998's commencement ceremony is
scheduled for Sunday, May 17. Who
will be speaking at the ceremony re
mains a question.
The possibilities for speakers in
clude President Bill Clinton and Mr.
Dick Schultz.
The Commencement Committee
extended a speaking invitation to
Clinton in late October.
Currently, he has neither ac
cepted nor declined. The Committee
calls the White House every Friday for
an update on the situation.
"It isn't out of the ordinary that
he [Clinton] has not responded yet,"
says Jill Trott_, Chairperson of the Com
mencement Committee, "For security
reasons, his schedule is not planned that
far in advance."
In case Clinton does decline the

offer to speak, Dick Schultz has also
been asked to give the talk.
Schultz has accepted and will be
in Gettysburg on May 17 regardless of
Clinton's presence. Schultz is also
scheduled to receive an Honorary
Gettysburg College Degree.
Although not an alumnus of
Gettysburg, Schultz is considered a
"friend of the College." He is a former
member of the Board of Trustees.
Schultz has served as the Executive Di
rector of the NCAA and is currently the
head of the Olympic Committee.
To choose a commencement
speaker, the Senior Class Cabinet and
Commencement Committee work all
year with the Executive Assistant to the
President of the College. Currently, the
position is held by Suzanne Johnson
Flynn. - continued on page 4 -

College community discusses future goals

Debate over new facilities dominates "town meeting"

by Dan Arcari
Technology Manager
On April 2, the Common
Hour featured a special "town
meeting" to inform the campus
community about the physical
structure of the campus. The
presentation covered renova
tions to existing buildings, pos
sibilities for new buildings as
well as landscape issues. The
college has set a 10-15 year
goal, at a price tag of some
$200 million dollars to upgrade
the facilities and environment
of Gettysburg College.
The plans, which have
taken into account suggestions
from the Committee on the
Future, still have to be pre
sented to the Board of Trust
ees for approval.

With the expansion of
Information Resources, the li
brary has seen decreased build
ing space available for its own
purposes. Among various de
partment shiftings, IR may be
moved into a renovated Plank
Hall that would feature stu
dent-oriented departments.
Among these offices would be
academic advising, career plan
ning and advising and the in¬

ternship center. The gym and
fitness areas would be re
moved, and an additional floor
would be added to the top of
the building.
In the College Union
Building, the early plans call for
the removal of the pool which
would be relocated in Bream
Wright Hauser as part of an
addition that would expand the
recreational and fitness facili
ties available to non-athletes on
campus.
A new science building is
also planned, and would incor
porate both the biology and
chemistry departments,
thereby making Bnedenbaugh
available for renovation and
conversion into a freshman
dorm. The new science build
ing would likely be located in
the area behind Masters and
would be part of a new science
quad.

Among the landscaping
issues were plans to remove the
unused pool from Paxton this
summer and replace it with a
small grove of trees. Plans for
"edges, gates and borders" call
for more signs of demarcation
as to where the college's prop
erty actually begins. Among the

more significant of these plans
is a large archway and sign sys
tem to be located on North
Washington Street near Ice
House. Plans are also under
consideration for the removal
of the parking lot at College
Apartments, to be replaced by
a garden and park-type envi
ronment. The issue of campus
parking was not directly ad
dressed in the presentation.
Other topics included
finding a facility in which to
locate the Political Science de
partment once the White
House is turned into an alumni
center. Further renovation of
the freshman and upperclass
dorms, as well as the construc
tion of a new residence all were
important parts of this overall
plan.

The construction of a
new auditorium for the per
forming arts was a topic almost
overlooked in the presentation.
In the question and answer pe
riod following the presenta
tion, several faculty members
and numerous students from
many departments questioned
President Haaland as to why
the construction of a new per
forming arts center received a

low priority on the
administration's overall lists
of goals to be achieved in the
next decade. Faculty and stu
dent pointed out the gener
ally poor quality of our per
forming spaces compared
with similar schools. Few
definite answers were given,
but the availability of funds
and space were cited as prob
lems. Although the adminis
tration seems to favor the
construction of a new sci
ence facility over a perform
ing arts center, the audience
reaction at the end of the

presentation seemed to indi
cate that the campus has op
posite feelings. Almost all of
the forty minutes devoted to
question and answer were
occupied by students and
faculty arguing their case for
a new performance facility.
When the session was ended,
students were still in line at
the microphones. In the af
termath of the meeting, a
petition and letter-writing
campaign were begun to en
courage the administration
to reconsider the issue of
performance space for the
arts.

Sloat leaves legacy of learning
Professor of Chemistry Emeritus dies at 99

by Henry Fawell
Assistant News Editor

the Gettysburg College chem
istry building, was built in his
honor.
Dr. Sloat is one member
of a teaching legacy at
Gettysburg College that
stretches for decades. As a stu
dent here he was taught by Dr.
Breidenbaugh, the professor
after whom the chemistry
building was named. Then, as
a Professor, Dr. Sloat taught Dr.
Alex Rowland, who, in his time
teaching here at the college, has
taught a number of present-day
professors.
"He was a great influence
on a lot of lives," said Dr.
Rowland, "Over many genera
tions, he taught his students a
lot of things. Not just chemis
try, but running a lab, even
photography. He was a real
good man."

Dr. Charles A. Sloat, Pro
fessor of Chemistry for over 40
years at Gettysburg College,
died on April 7 in Gettysburg
Hospital. He was 99.
Sloat was a 1923 gradu
ate of Gettysburg College and
a 1924 graduate of Haverford
College. He received his Ph.D.
from Princeton University in
1930. Sloat served in the U.S.
Army and was a World War II
veteran. He was later military
governor of Landkreis-Co
logne from 1944-1946.
He came to Gettysburg as
an assistant professor in 1927
and, despite a brief intermis
sion in during WWII, taught
until he retired in 1968 as a full
professor. The Sloat Library, in

Dr. Sloat was a 50 year
member and former president
of American Chemical Society
and founding member of Skep
tical Chymist Society. He was
also a member of the Society
of Metals, and the American
Association for the Advance
ment of Science.
Born December 12,1898
in Cashtown, he was the son
of the late J. Walter and Clara
Funt Sloat. He is survived by
his wife of 51 years, Marion
Biggs Sloat.
Funeral services will be
held at 10:00 a.m. Friday, April
10, in Gettysburg College's
Christ Chapel, with Rev. Jef
frey Swanger officiating. Me
morial contributions may be
sent to Orrtanna United Meth
odist Church or to the Sloat
Library.

WZBT turns fifty

Radio station celebrates anniversary
with broadcast from Hallof Fame

from Press Release
The student run, non
commercial radio station of
Gettysburg College, WZBT
91.1 FM, turns fifty years old
this year.
The station began broad
casting in 1948 on AM under
the call letters WWGC.
To celebrate its fiftieth
anniversary, WZBT broad
casted live from the Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame and Museum
in Cleveland, Ohio on Satur
day, April 4, from 9:00 a.m. to
9:00 p.m.
Several WZBT alumni
and over thirty student disc
jockeys broadcasted assorted
formats focusing on the history

of rock and roll.
Station manager Tim
Funk ('00) said, "It's a college
disc jockey's dream to broad
cast live from the Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame, and we are
able to make over thirty
people's dreams come true. It's
our fiftieth anniversary, and we
couldn't ask for a better trip to
celebrate it."
WZBT built a strong re
lationship with the people in
Cleveland last year. In the
spring of 1997, thirty WZBT
disc jockeys went to Cleveland
to broadcast. The station
broadcasted for four hours that
evening, from 5:00 to 9:00
p.m. The trip was very success
ful and everyone wanted to do

it again.

Gettysburg College
has increased its town and
college listenership in recent

a more professionally run

French Department lecture
commemorates Dreyfus Affair

Emile Zola wrote an open let
ter under the heading
'J'accuse" that was published
on the front page of a newspa
per. In the letter, Zola accused
the army of covering up its mis
taken conviction of Dreyfus.
Because of Zola's article, a new
government came to power, the
role of the press was trans
formed, the rule of law and re
spect for truth were more
firmly established in rhe _v na

brought into line, and the in
tellectual class was accorded
the status it still holds as the

New co-directors lead Women's Center into tenth year

by Cara Masucci
Staff Reporter Next year, this campus
will celebrate the tenth anniver
sary of the formation of a place
where everyone can go to re
lax, have a good time, and be
treated with respect. This place
is the Women's Center. In ad
dition to its many purely social
apsects, the Center also offers
a wide variety of activities and
programs.
The two new directors of
the Women's Center, junior T.J.
Scott and sophomore Lisa
Wingenroth, hope to build on
the image that the Center can
be a place for relaxing, social
izing, and even watching tele
vision, on top of its other func¬

tions. Over the past ten years
the Women's Center has cre
ated and developed many pro
grams to which the campus

Lisa Wingenroth troth, '00

looks forward. These activities
range from learning lunches
and the annual Women's Con
ference to mocktails on a Fri
day night. They have become
staples of the Gettysburg Col
lege community.
Both Wingenroth and
Scott would like to keep activi
ties like this, as well as add
some new programs that would
be beneficial to the campus.
The two directors have met
several times for training and

are in the initial planning stages
for next year's activities.
The two women would
like to probe deeper into the
issues of diversity in all do
mains, and how to get more
men at Gettysburg College to
take advantage of the Women's
Center. This would add to the
different types of diversity that
range from gender differences
and racial diversity to eco
nomic and social diversity.
Scott and Wingenroth

earned the positions of co-di
rectors after applying earlier
this semester and being se
lected from a highly talented
and active pool of women.
Both Wingenroth and Scott
had been involved with the
Women's Center in the past.
They attended the national
Women's Conference at
Georgetown in Washington
D.C. last summer. Wingenroth
commented that "it [the con
ference] was really exciting."
In addition to the na
tional conference, Wingenroth
was on the planning commit
tee for Gettysburg's own
Women's Conference. Scott
was a housesitter and sat on the
Associates Board at the Center
this past year. Their diverse
backgrounds and experiences
at the Center allows for them
to set their goals on diversity
from a variety of areas.

The women are required
to organize events on such ba
sic issues as sexual violence,
alcohol awareness, AIDS
awareness, and women's
health. The two women do
have some leeway, however,
and hope to work closely with
a variety of people on making
next year a success for the
Women's Center.
Scott would like to see
people form a greater respect
for others and themselves with
help from the Center. At the
Women's Center, she feels
people will be "respected for
their ideas." Her main goal is
to open people up to entirely
different ideas than those they
are used to. Wingenroth and
Scott would like to focus on ex
posing the campus community
to something they may not
have thought of previously.

In addition, as a Women's
Studies major, Scott would like
to see a merging of the
Women's Center and the
women's studies department
into a more cohesive unit. The
Center will also work with In
tercultural Relations to foster
a campus centered on diversity.

T.J. Scott, '99

A major goal of Scott and
Wingenroth is to expose the
Center to everyone on campus.
Both women commented that
they would like to make more
people aware of where the
Women's Center is, and that it
is there for the campus. The
Center has two floors open to
the campus, a conference
room, a television, a computer,
a library for research, as well
as a whole slew of other facili
ties open to anyone who would
like to use them. There are
even guest bedrooms open for
student use.
Both directors have made
it a priority to get men to take
advantage of the Women's
Center. Scott and Wingenroth
feel that sometimes men feel

ostracized by the idea that it is
a Women's Center, but as Scott
comments, "We don't bite!" By
making the Center a social out
let, the co-directors hope to
bring more men to the Center
so they can experience it first
hand. The Center is a place for
everyone.
The women encourage
anyone who wants to experi
ence the Center and get in
volved to do so. It exists not
simply to foster women's ad
vancement in society, but for
furthering the social advance
ment of the entire campus com
munity. It is a place to hang
out and chill, to let loose the
worries of schoolwork, and a
place where respect and fun are
priority.

Contributing Reporter
South of Miami lies a
chain of westward-curving
tropical islands known as the
Florida Keys. A one-lane high
way composed of hundreds of
bridges link the islands of man
grove to the southern coast of
Florida. As bridges fade in the
rear view mirror, civilization
fades too. Travelers to the
Florida Keys become engulfed
in a culture that is unlike any
other in America.
The mingling of the At
lantic Ocean, the Gulf of
Mexico and the clear Carib
bean waters attract a society of
unruly outlaws, festering bums,
philosophical bartenders, and
burgundy-faced fisherman.
Added to the mix are thousands
of American tourists in search
of adventure. All are domes¬

tic-expatriates: men and
women who seek an escape
from restrictive, unimaginative
routine. What better place to
spend a spring break?
Our first view of the Keys
came shortly after leaving the

By the end of the 1970s,
however, Key West surrendered
to capitalism. The tourist in

glitzy cruise ships, and cheap T

crossed the last bridge,

into the Gulf of Mexico.
The magnificent and eccentric
town of Key West, far from
Gettysburg College, lay ahead.
In the late 1960s the is
land reached a pinnacle of out
rageousness: anything was ac
cepted. Writers, singers, hip
pies, gays, and smugglers, all
seeking freedom migrated to
Key West. The outrageous
character of Key West, com
bined with its location, ap
pealed to every group. The leg

Key West and the Florida
Keys are islands of dreamers.
The locals, as well as the tour

peace and freedom. The Keys
are like a medicine that brings
contentment and serenity.

Dippin' your face off

by Joe Madigan and Petei
Scaffidi Contributing Reporters
Ever since the 1980s,
smokeless tobacco has become
increasingly popular among
young teens, specifically among
young men. It was mostly prac
ticed as an alternate for smok
ing, but it is now well known
that throwing a dip in can cause
serious health effects. Th_^
truth is, when you chew spit
tobacco, you're not just getting
what you think to be a good
taste and continuous flow of
nicotine, but you're also ab
sorbing over 2000 chemicals
into your blood stream.
What are the health ef
fects? CANCER. Cancer of
the mouth (including the lip,
tongue, and cheek) and throat.
Along with cancer, you may
also contract LEUKOPLAKIA.

becomes irritated by the to
bacco juice. This causes a
white, leathery patch to form,
and this is called leukoplakia.
These patches can differ in size,
shape, and appearance. They
can also be pre-cancerous.

HEART DIS
EASE. The continu
ous flow of nico
tine into your _^m
body may cause _^KA
many other _^Bfl
side effects, _^^H
including in- _^^g
creased heart _^m
rate, increased _^B
blood pressure, _^_A

and sometimes _^_A
irregular heart- _^^
beats. Nicotine in the body also
causes constricted blood ves
sels, which can slow down re
action time and cause dizzi
ness—not a good move if you
play sports.
GUM AND TOOTH
DISEASE. Spit tobacco perma
nently discolors teeth. Chew¬

ing tobacco causes bad breath.
Its direct and repeated contact
with the gums causes them to
recede, which can cause your
teeth to fall out. Spit tobacco
con¬

tains ^^
a lot of sugar
which, when mixed with
plaque on your teeth, forms
acid that eats away at tooth
enamel, causes cavities and
chronic painful sores.
Besides those health ef
fects, throwing a dip in can also
put a damper on your social
status. The really bad breath,
discolored teeth, gunk stuck in
your teeth, and constant spit
ting can have a very negative
effect on your social and love
life. An even more serious ef
fect of spit tobacco is oral can
cer; the surgery for this could
lead to removal of parts of your
face, tongue, cheek, or lip.
Early warning signs:
Check your mouth often, look
ing closely at the places where

you hold the tobacco. See your
doctor if you have any of the
following:
1. A sore that bleeds eas
ily and does not heal.
2. A lump or thickening
anywhere in your mouth or
neck.

3. Soreness or
swelling that does not
go away.
4. A red or
white patch that does
not go away_,
_k 5. Trouble
_^_k chewing, swal
^^ lowing, or mov
^H ing your tongue
^^ or jaw.
Even if you
do

_^ a prob¬
lem today, see your doc
tor or dentist every three
months to have your mouth
checked. Your chances for
fighting the cancer are higher
if you find it early.
So now that you know
the bad news for chewing to
bacco, and are probably wor
ried that your face might end
up very messed up, do some
thing about it and quit before
it's too late! Although kicking
the habit of chewing tobacco is
very difficult (since chewing
tobacco is more addictive than
smoking), it can be done. Re
member, most people do not
start chewing on their own, so
do not try quitting on your

own. Ask for help and posi
tive reinforcement from your
support groups (friends, par
ents, coaches, teachers, whom
ever). You must first think of
reasons why you want to quit.
You may want to quit because
you don't want lip cancer, the
people around you find it of
fensive, you do not want
stained teeth or no teeth, you
do not like being addicted to
nicotine, or you may just want
to start leading a healthier life.
Whatever the reason may be,
chose one and remember it!

Then take some action.
Pick a quit date and throw out
all of your chewing tobacco and
snuff. Ask your friends, family,
teachers, etc., to help you kick
the habit by giving you support
and encouragement. Tell your
friends not to offer you smoke
less tobacco. You may even
want to ask a friend to quit with
you. Find an alternative to
chewing. Chew gum, or eat
sunflower seeds, raisins, or
dried fruits. Find activities to
keep your mind off chewing.
Work out, talk to your friends,

or listen to music. Exercise can
help relieve tension caused by
quitting. Reward yourself by
saving the money you would
have spent on tobacco and buy
something for yourself.
Good luck!

A movie you'd better not miss

by Eileen O Donnell
Movie Columnist
Since its release in 1985,
Better Off Dead has gained a
cult following. This quirky
film stars a very young John
Cusack (Say Anything, Grosse
Pointe Blank) as Lane Meyer.
Lane is an average teen with a
not-soordinary life. His
mom's meals take on a life of
their own. His eight year old
brother, Badger, is building a
rocket ship out of household

In Case You Missed It

appliances. His dad (David
Ogden Stiers of M*A*S*H*)
is a lawyer obsessed with beat
ing the paperboy at his own
game. Lane has all he could
ever wish for in his girlfriend
Beth (Amanda " Wyss, who
broke Judge Reinhold's heart
in Fast Times at Ridgemont
High). After Lane doesn't
make the Greendale High ski
racing team, Beth dumps him
for ski jock Roy Stalin (Aaron
Dozier). Now Lane's world

has fallen apart. He doesn't see
any way he can go on without
Beth. So Lane decides to call it
a life, only his feeble attempts
at suicide are mare comical than
serious.
B u t _BI_^_MHHBHH

through it
all, he has
his pal
Charles de
Mar (Curtis
Armstrong,
best known for
his role as
Booger in
Revenge of
the Nerds)
to help him
along.

There's always a weird best
friend in these movies, it seems.
Charles knows high school
women. After all, he's been a
student at Greendale High for
seven and a half years. He's no
dummy. All Lane has to do, ac
cording to Charles' infinite wis¬

dom, is ski from the K-12.
Making a gnarly run from the
top of the glacier will surely
catch the eye of Beth.
Besides Beth and Roy,
Lane has other problems to

contend with. He is forever
getting challenged to race with
two Korean brothers, one who
speaks no English and one who
learned English from watching
The Wide World of Sports. His
clunky station wagon is no
match for their hot rod, so

Lane is continually left in the
dust. In addition, Lane is also
being harassed by Johnny, the
local paperboy, and his legion
of evil paperboys over a mat¬

ter of two
dollars.
Lane
also has an
admirer
from afar.
Well, from
across the
street,
anyway.
Her name
i s
Monique and she is
a foreign

_^^^^^^^^^^^ exchange
student living with the Smiths,
Lane's neighbors. Mrs. Smith
is quite a character. She spon
sored Monique so that her
weirdo son Ricky (Daniel
Schneider, Dennis from tv's
Head of the Class) who just sits
in the house all day crocheting,

could have someone to play
with. Monique doesn't speak
any English, but Mrs. Smith is
certain that she and Ricky will
learn to speak the international
language of love.
Interestingly enough,
Savage Steve Holland, who
wrote and directed this film,
says that Better Off Dead is par
tially autobiographical. He
started to make depressing
movies after his high school
sweetheart ditched him. His
friends didn't sympathize; they
just laughed. This knowledge
just makes the movie funnier.
Better Off Dead is one of
those movies you'll have to see
again and again because it is so
rich. Watch it with friends who
are quick witted and easily
amused. This film is light and
farcical, quite the opposite of
some of the other 80's high
school flicks. Where The

Breakfast Club is full of teen
angst and social commentary,
Better Off Dead is just a good
time.

CONFLICT & Consensus

True campus treasure

To the Editor

In the last few weeks, I
have had the opportunity and
privilege to attend concerts by
the Chapel Choir, Symphonic
Band, Jazz Ensemble, College
Choir, the Four Scores and
the Christ Chapel Handbells.
I assure those of you who
missed these performances
that you not only missed fine
music-making but indeed the
opportunity to experience the
vibrancy of successful coop
erative efforts in this liberal
arts community.
Emotion, prose, move
ment, music, and light were
given life in many diverse and
wonder-filled ways. These
concerts provided opportuni
ties to support our students
and friends, to support their
directors, who give so much

of their time and themselves to
these ensembles, and the op
portunity to bid farewell to a
respected professor as he con
ducted his last performance of
the College Choir, in essence,
the opportunity to experience
some of the performing arts at
their very best. They were key
examples of what faculty and
some 200 students working
together can accomplish.
As an alumnus of this col
lege (and it's Chapel Choir), a
member of the professional
community, and as a great ad
mirer of our students and fac
ulty in the music program, I
offer my congratulations,
thanks, and appreciation to the
members and directors of the
Christ Chapel Handbells,
Chapel Choir, College Choir,
Symphonic Band, the Four

Scores, and the Jazz Ensemble.
All did a wonderful job, many
doing double and triple duty.
Gettysburg College has
much to be proud of! Not least
of these is our music program,
which is a true jewel in the
College's crown. I urge every
one to avail themselves of the
opportunities our music de
partment offers - if you don't,
you're missing out on some of
the best Gettysburg College has
to offer.
Sincerely,
William Gohl '96

A memory of April 4,
1968—the day Martin Luther
King, Jr., was shot. "It is an
image that comes back to me
every time I think of that day,
April 4, 1968, when Rev. King
was shot." -Samuel Mudd
In both cases, 1 was ac
tually on the Gettysburg Col
lege Campus when I heard
that JFK and Martin Luther
King, Jr., were shot with a
sniper's rifle. I remember
exactly when I heard about
President Kennedy: walking
with three colleagues, Paul
Whitley, Charles Platt and
Lou Frank from Glatfelter
Hall to Glatfelter Lodge to
review building plans for
what was to be McCreary

A Moment in history

To the Editor:

Hall. I do not remember the
exact spot where I heard about
Reverend King. It was some
where in the south end of the
basement of Breidenbaugh
Hall, where the Psychology
Department had its first labo
ratories in that year. It was a
Thursday and the department
was about to present Bert
Green from Carnegie-Mellon
University who was speaking to
us about the kinetic depth ef
fect. When that program was
over, I learned that College
Chaplain John Vannorsdall and
President Arnold Hanson had
led a memorial demonstration
group of students and faculty
to the Peace Light on
Mummasburg Road, where

various persons spoke of their
anger and despair.
I caught up with that
group of thirty of so as they
were returning to the campus,
walking off the berm by the
ditch on the east side of the
road. I stood to the side in the
ditch as they straggled by—sub
dued, somber, avoiding eye
contact as they went. Arnold
Hanson and John Vannorsdall
led. It was a warm day and
gray, with a little sun. I joined
the group at the back to finish
the last two hundred yards of
the pilgrimage. When we got
to Lincoln Avenue we went
home, alone.

College students are
blamed for many of these of
fenses. We are all aware of the
tension between students and
"townies." But now the accusa
tions have gone too far.
Recently, a group of con
cerned citizens formed the Hazel
Alley Association. The aim of
these disgruntled residents is to
bring their grievances to the at
tention of the College and the
Borough.
Although there are a num
ber of problems caused by some
college students, town residents
are too quick to blame every pre
dicament on Gettysburg
undergrads. It is easy to look
around, see what is wrong with
your neighborhood, and blame it
on someone you don't know and
have no connection to. Residents
should not be so hasty to accuse
all college students.
The College administra
tion, particularly Residence Life
and Greek Life, are as much to
blame as any individual student.
By not harshly punishing those
who blatantly break the policies
set forth by the College, they en
able, and indeed encourage, this
repugnant behavior.
For example, two fraterni¬

ties were denied the use of their
houses by the College this year.
Rather than facing severe conse
quences, the brothers were al
lowed to continue their repulsive
lifestyles off campus.
By condoning such activi
ties, these offices make the Col
lege and its students appear to be
a bunch of reckless rascals. The
rules and regulations are no good
unless enforced; when they go
ignored it reflects badly each and
every one of us.
It is important to note as
well that not all of Gettysburg's
problems are caused by college
students.
On any given night of the
week large groups of obnoxious
high school students can be found
wondering the streets of Gettys
burg. They are just as loud and
violent as any group of college
students. Yet residents are not
giving any attention to the masses
of delinquents weekly haunting
such popular hangouts as gas sta
tion parking lots and vacant alley
ways. Some college students are
the beasts citizens make them out
to be. These individuals should
be punished strictly. However,
residents should not be so quick
to blame the entire campus com
munity for the faults of a few.
Most students are not the mon
sters many "townies" imagine.

CONFLICT & Consensus
This Side of Cynicism

Forget the president
by LA. Isherwood
Columnist As I was walking across
our campus, desperately trying
to think of a topic for my col
umn, I observed a group of stu
dents talking and complaining
about apathy with lethargic
looks on their faces and bad
language. It seems as though
this one little word causes more
grief to so many people on our
campus than any other. Apa
thy itself is a marvelous word
for it is only six letters long but
a whole whopping three syl
lables to pronounce. Thus it is
the little big word, or the little
giant (to use a historical anec
dote) of the great word king
dom.

As I eavesdropped a
scheme came into my head of
how to make this place a little
more efficient. In my estima
tion leadership in these matters
is from the top down, so I pro-

and the dean, bring
pose a few changes to our ad
ministration for the most pro
ductivity possible (mind my
choice of words for I am not
suggesting by any means better
administrators from an ethical
standpoint).
The highest office on our
campus is the President of the
College who probably takes
more criticism daily than Bill
Clinton does in a whole year
from the National Organiza
tion of Women. My suggested
replacement for this role is
none other than the Duke,
that's right John Wayne the
"greatest" American to ever
cross the Rio Grande and kill
lots of people. The Duke
would force us all to get along
or else we'd get a good horse
wuppin' or end up under the
sole of his boot.
within a few weeks he'd
have everyone's Beamers or
Ford Explorers taken away and
we'd all be given a pair of cow-

in the Duke and the
boy boots and a Stetson hat to
compensate. Why? Because
that's all the Duke ever needed
to beat up lots of people and
steal their horses. Hell, he
didn't even need the boots, and
he sure wouldn't need them to
take our campus.
We would all have to
learn the hard way. No more
sissy little pens and paper for
our academics, with John
Wayne you are in the How to
Be a Cowboy So You Can
Smoke Yourself to Death
school. Instead of reading
Hawthorne we all will be re
quired to memorize Will
Rodgers quotes and stupid pick
up lines so we can always ride
into the sunset with some dame
(or fella') across our saddles.
Could we complain? No,
complaints are illegal. The
Duke would ruff us into shape
so that we would fill the boots
of that quintessential American
ideal he left us with.
For Dean of the College

Chairman of the Board

we could appoint none other
than Frank Sinatra. In addition
to sound advice about how to
offend everyone in a given
room at the same time, he
could provide free concerts. If
you had a problem and went
to "Old Blue Eyes," sure
enough he'd reply "shut that
landfill you call a mouth and
get outa my office. What?
Whadda you looking at? Are
you stupid or what?" That
might seem a little harsh but
when Frankie opens his mouth
all can be forgotten within his
melodic voice. Frankie can
make us all feel a little more
humble as he publicly harasses
us and humiliates almost every
one he sees. Who needs books
when you've got to the Frankie
school of hard knocks. The
best part of it is that Frankie
will appoint his old pal from
stage and screen Dean Martin
as head of all campus parties.
Drinks are on the house when
Dino's tending bar.

With these tough guys
Gettysburg College can remedy
the apathy bug and we all can
lead more "efficient" lives.
Maybe we could even find a job
for Sammy Davis Jr. and
Humphery Bogart. That way
we can cover all of the bases.
Maybe even get Ernest
Hemingway as head of the
Writing Center to lecture on
how to be miserable your
whole life and write real good
too. There is no end to the pos
sibilities. With these
showboaters we could have an
all star cast of administrators
and be the envy of every real
American institution. It might
not be the most enjoyable col
lege experience, but at least we
won't have to worry about hav
ing nothing to do or being lazy.
Maybe in my next column I'll
place J.P. Morgan as the head
of the economics department,
and Karl Marx as head of the
College republicans just for
laughs.

For the past two semes
ters, we, like most students at
Gettysburg College, have sim
ply READ The Gettysburgian,
while not contributing to its
production. At the Editor of
the Opinions call to response
in his article found in the April
2 edition of the paper, we have
decided to break our silence.
First and foremost, this
letter is NOT a collection of
complaints, similar to many of
the articles that have been pub
lished recently. That is not to
say that we think people should
be restricted in expressing their
concerns about campus issues.
However, it is one thing to dis
cuss an important issue such as
the overlapping of departmen
tal programs (as Dr. Janet Pow
ers did two weeks ago); it is
quite another thing to take an
entire article to complain about
air conditioning (or lack there

Proof someone is reading

To the Editor

of). As Michael Petro pointed
out in his article entitled "Town
Meeting...", some people are
tired of hearing the "I pay
$30,000 to go here..." excuse.
We all know this amount seems
extremely high and often ex
cessive, which it may very well
be. At the same time, does the
"air conditioning dilemma"
improve in anyway when it is
repeatedly addressed in one
single issue of The Gettysburg
ian} One would think that con
tacting Facilities Services would
help to rectify the situation suf
ficiently. If not, and this awful
problem remains, we need to
consider one thing: How vital
is air conditioning in the pro
gression of out health and hap
piness anyway? Personally, we
don't have air conditioning at
our homes, and some people
don't even have homes (We
mention this because we are

involved in "Habitat for Hu
manity" -anyone interested in
helping can contact us). De
spite the lack of an environ
mentally harmful luxury, we
seemed to have turned out o.k.
in the long run. Arguing that
you aren't getting your
money's worth in your educa
tion (determined by artificial
cold air in April) seems a bit
petty. We also want to comment
about a point well made by
Petro about respect. We ac
knowledge that it is not only
members of our campus com
munity whose level of respect
seems to be dwindling (these
days, it seems like it's occurring
everywhere...), but he success
fully brings to light something
that we have often considered
ourselves. For example, who
has seen what the mailroom
looks like after lunch? Instat¬

ing that students here: "...
throw trash around expecting
the hard working men and
women of Facilities Services to
clean it up," Petro makes a valid
claim on the general laziness of
students who can't seem to find
the recycle bin (which, by the
way, is two feel away). Basi
cally, we feel that those students
who complain should be the
ones taking the initiative to
demonstrate positive actions
and consideration to everyone
and every THING.
There are many other is
sues that concern us. However,
as we said, we don't want to
gripe when it seems as though
there will be no positive results.
We enjoy reading The Gettys
burgian and hope to see more
articles focused on ways that
students can contribute more
beneficially to the campus com
munity. Perhaps we would sug¬

gest for The Gettysburgian to
become a better outlet for
learning about happenings out
side of Gettysburg, as well as
to contain more substantial ar
ticles about campus programs,
such as speakers (there are so
many each week that one indi
vidual could never attend them
all). We support free speech
and free expression, otherwise
we would not be able to write
this letter. It would be nice to
think that people care more
about the world at large and
want to take an ACTIVE role
in resolving whatever they may
feel are imperative issues.
However, simply reevaluating
you own position in this soci
ety we share would be enough.

CONFLICT & Consensus
The Pachyderm's Pulpit
Welcoming an American treasure

by John Dunlap
Political Columnist
On April 13th Gettysburg
College will host a piece of
American history, the former
United States Senate Majority
Leader, the Honorable Robert
Dole. Senator Dole for nearly
a half century has dedicated his
life to public service from his
service in the United States
Army during World War II, to
being the 1996 Republican
Nominee for the Presidency of
United States.
Most of us know Senator
Dole from his run for president
during the last presidential
election but Bob Dole's most
lasting legacy may be as one of
the greatest members of the
United States Congress.

Bob Dole was born and
raised in almost the exact
middle of the continental
United States, Russell, Kansas.
Bom in 1923, Dole's childhood
was not easy. He lived with his
father, Doran and his mother,
Bina, along with a brother and
two sisters during the dust bowl
and the Great Depression. Life
was not easy, but the Dole's
made it through. Bob excelled
in sports.
In 1941, Bob Dole
headed off to Kansas State Uni
versity, but World War II called.
Dole served in the Tenth
Mountain Division in Italy
where he was severely
wounded. At first the doctors
did not believe that Dole would
live, then they did not believe
he would be able to walk, but
he proved them wrong. Bob
Dole lost the use of one of his
arms but he returned to college
and eventually received a law
degree from Washburn Univer¬

sity. Right out of law school
Bob Dole was elected to the
Kansas State Legislature as a
Republican representing his
hometown. From 1953 to
1961 he was the Russell
County State Attorney and, in
1960, Dole was elected to Con
gress. From 1961 to 1969 Bob
Dole served in the United States

House of Representatives. Vot
ing wise Bob Dole was a con
servative but he almost always
did what was right. In 1964,
for instance, he supported the
historic Civil Rights Bill. In
1968, Bob Dole moved over to
the Senate where he served for
the next 27 and a half years.

This new senator from
Kansas was a strong defendei
of farmers, veterans and the
disabled. Three groups he
cared deeply about and that
were very personal to
him. Senator
Dole also _^^^^mm
became _^^^^^^^^H
a _^^^^^_K_^^^
strong _^_A^^r j_^^B_^
_.Ls

dent Richard Nixon and in
1971 the President appointed
him Chairman of the Republi
can National Committee. This
was a very difficult time for
Dole as he and his wife di
vorced. They had one daugh
ter, Robin, who has always re
mained close to her father.
In 1974, with the
Watergate Scandal and the res
ignation of President Nixon, re
publicans were in trouble. Bob
Dole was in the fight of his po
litical life and was narrowly re
elected to Congress. Follow
ing the election, Dole married
Elizabeth Hanford, a member
of the Federal Trade Commis
sion. Dole soon entered the na¬

tional stage when in 1976,
presidential nominee Gerald
Ford, was looking for a running
mate. Vice President Nelson
Rockefeller was not seeking the
nomination and the president
who just fended off a chal
lenge from the former
conservative Gover
nor of Califor
nia, Ronald _^^
Reagan _^^^^^^

_^m redd
_^^r some -
_y one to
appeal to
Reagan
supporters.
Senator
Dole was his
man, as he be
came the
1976 Republi
can Nominee
for the Vice

Presidency of the United States.
Dole campaigned hard for the
GOP ticket and was accused of
being the hatchet man. The
funny very personable Bob
Dole did not come out in the
first ever Vice Presidential De
bate between Dole and Sena
tor Walter Mondale of Minne
sota. In the end he came across
as too aggressive. The Ford
Dole ticket made a strong
comeback but was defeated by
the Democratic team of Jimmy
Carter and Walter Mondale.
Four years later, Bob
Dole tried for the Republican
Nomination for the Presidency
himself, but Ronald Reagan be
came the nominee, defeating

Dole and future president
George Bush. Dole was re
elected to the Senate and be
came Chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee. In that
position Dole helped enact the
Reagan agenda and in 1982
worked to save Social Se
_ curity. 1985
_^^^^^^. was the

_^^ H_^^^^ begin
^^_T ^^^k n i ng
_^ _T _^H of Bob
_y _^^^^ M Dole's
_^K/^^^^^^ m time as
_^^^^^^^W the Re
^^^^^^^^w
publican
_^^^^^^^r Leader of
^^^^^ the Senate.
^^^_r For the next
11 and half years
Dole served as the
GOP Leader. From
I 1985 to 1987 he served
as Senate Majority Leader
and from 1987 to 1995

Dole served in the opposition
as Minority leader. With the
historic republican takeover of
Congress in 1994, Senator
Dole returned to the majority.
Following his reelection
in 1986, Bob Dole made an
other effort to win the GOP
Presidential Nomination. In
1988, Dole was the main op
position to Vice President
George Bush. Dole defeated
Bush in the Iowa Caucus but
was defeated in a tough New
Hampshire primary. After that,
it was all down hill as George
Bush won the nomination and

the election.
As president, George
Bush found Bob Dole to be one
of his most loyal supporters.
Mrs. Dole served in the Bush
Cabinet as the Secretary of La
bor. Before that she had served
as Ronald Reagan's Secretary of
Transportation. In 1991, she
left the Administration to work
as President of the American
Red Cross. During this period
Bob Dole battled prostate can
cer and re-election at home.
Like always, however, the
people of Kansas returned their
senator to Washington. This
time for a fifth term into the
Senate.
With Bill Clinton's elec¬

tion to the Presidency in 1991
Senator Dole returned to the
national spotlight uniting re
publicans against the Clinton
agenda.
In 1995, it was Bob Dole_,
along with House Speaker
Newt Gingrich, who fought for
a balanced budge.
It was in 1995 that Bob
Dole decided he had one more
mission, another run for presi
dent. Dole, this time was the
frontrunner and after a scare in
the New Hampshire primary,
Bob Dole at the age of 73 fi
nally became the Republican
Nominee for the Presidency of
the United States.
Before the Republican
National Convention, Senate
Majority Leader Dole resigned
from Congress to dedicate all
of his time to running for presi
dent.

With the former Secre
tary of Housing and Urban De
velopment Jack Kemp as his
running mate the Dole cam
paign ran into tough times. Ir
one of the most negative in
cumbent presidential cam
paigns in history, the Clinton
campaign bombarded Bob
Dole. Once again in the na
tional spotlight the real Bob
Dole did not shine through and
in the end by a margin of 49%
to 41% President Clinton de
feated Citizen Dole.
Bob Dole's campaign for
President was special to me.
I was on the floor of the
Republican National Conven
tion in San Diego, California to
see him accept his Presidential
Nomination and on few occa
sions I have had the honor to
meet both Senator and Mrs.
Dole. I found Bob Dole to be
funny and very genuine.

It was an honor to see
him address the Republican
National Convention and it
was an honor to cast my first
ever vote in a Presidential Elec
tion for a man who I consider
a true American hero.
I urge everyone to come
out a welcome this great man
to our campus. This is a real
honor. Welcome Senator Dole
and thank you!

MERL SAUNDERS & THE RAINFOREST BAND
The Junction
Sponsored by G.E.C.O., Office of Student Activities/College Union, WZBT, Jazz Appreciation Society
For more than three decades, fans have been getting high on the music of Merl Saunders. His repertoire runs the gamut from funk to
blues to rock to jazz, and most recently new age but his audience is not concerned with musical genres; "It's the vibe that counts," he
says. Merl has shared the stage and studio with the likes of Harry Belefonte, Lionel Hampton, B.B. King, Miles Davis, the Statler
Brothers, Paul _Butterfield, and of course, his beloved buddy, Jerry Garcia, whom he still lovingly referstto as "Jerome." Even bands like
Phish and Blues Traveler, with whom he frequently jams or sits in, have fallen under the spell of Merl Saunders. Merl's albums "Save
the Planet So We'll Have Some Place to Boogie", "Blues From the Rainforest", and his latest "Fiesta Amizonica" show his dedication to
the environment.

ZIGGYMARLEY
and the MEOLDY MAKERS with Special Surprise Guest

No group connects reggae's rich and spiritual heritage with today's music scene like Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers. Blessed
both by heredity and by singular talent, the Melody Makers have carried on their father's legacy by delivering stirring "roots" music
and a dizzying array of other styles on the eight acclaimed albums they have released since the mid '80s. Along the way, they have sold
millions of records, won two Grammy Awards, and played to countless devotees worldwide.

Sho'men and Fords fall victim to Bullet barrage

by Bill Davidson
Staff Repot to
The women's softball
team enjoyed a 4-0 record last
week, sweeping Washington
College on Thursday and
Haverford College on Satur
day. The Lady Bullets are now
15-4 overall and 6-0 in the
Centennial Conference, earn
ing them a tie for first place
with Dickinson.
In the first game Thurs
day, Angle Hoptak recorded a
7-4 win, allowing 4 runs (3
earned) on 5 hits. A balanced
offensive attack, which saw
four Bullets enjoy multi-hit
games, was lead by Traci Bul
lock, who went 2 for 3 with a
triple and two RBI.

The Bullets broke open a
tight second game with a three
run third inning. Jen White
provided a spark, scoring 2
runs on 2 triples. Erin Killeen
also contributed a steady bat,
going 2 for 2 with 2 RBI. Sa
rah Stokes pitched 7 strong in
nings to record the 6-2 win.

In Ha\erfoid, the Gettys
buig women trounced the
Fords 15-4, with the hitting of
Karyn Miller and Sara
Gravelme. Miller went 4 tor 5
with 4 RBI, including a double
and a triple. Gravehnc was a
double sh\ of the cycle, going
3 for 3 with 6 RBI. Suzanne
Dailey pitched 4 and 2/3 in
nings to record the win, and
Melissa Hazzard finished the
game with a scoreless 1 and 1/
3. The second game was no

different as the Lady Bullets out
slugged the Fords 16-7. Jen
White stole the show in this
one, going 4 for 4, with 2 hom
ers and 6 RBI.
White's performance
earned her the honor of Cen
tennial Conference Athlete of
the Week. She batted .688 (11
for 16) for the week, hitting
one double, two triples, and
two home runs. In the process,
White tied Gettysburg school
records for home runs (2) and
RBI (6) in a single game.
Thus far, Karyn Miller
leads the offensive attack with

How about a little hit and run?
down to first.
a .549 batting average. Jen
White is close behind, batting
.524 with a .857 on base per
centage and five stolen bases.
Jess Rising has added speed to
compliment the hitting, steal
ing 7 bases in the season.
Shortstop Sara Gravelme and
Jill Murphy have assisted the
Bullet pitching staff, pounding

While her teammate slides into third Sara Graveline hustles

a wall in the middle infield.
Suzanne Dailey leads the
team with a record of 4-0,
while Sarah Stokes has hurled
her way to a 3-0 record and a
microscopic 0.94 era. Angie
Hoptak has won her last 3
starts and the Katelyn Gorton/
Melissa Hazzard tandem has
combined for a 5-0 record,

mainly in relief.
The Lady Bullets have 3
home doubleheaders remain
ing. The women play host to
Ursinus and Muhlenberg on
consecutive Saturdays, April
1 lth and 18th, before the Mes
siah Falcons, a perennial pow
erhouse, invades Gettysburg on
Thursday April 23rd.



The Bunny is back; and he better have brought baseball

by Steve Jenkins
Sports Editor
Ah, it's Easter again.
Time for that bunny to come
hippity-hopping through the
fields to give out candy to all
the little boys and girls who
really do not need another
candy bar. Along with the an
noying rabbit comes something
as sweet and pure as a new
born child: BASEBALL SEA
SON. Do you smell that? No,
it is not the stupid easter bunny
carry any chocolate eggs. NO.
It is the sweet aroma of a
freshly cut infield, hot dogs,
and popcorn that make the
opening of this glorious base
ball season truly unique.
The players are done cry¬

ing over salary arbitration and
are primed and ready for their
attack run at this year's pen
nant. Time to watch Ken
Griffey Jr. make another run at
Maris' 61, and to sit back and
relax as Greg Maddux pitches
his way into Cooperstown.
"Well, Steve," you com
plain, "baseball is boring. I
would rather throw stones at
myself than watch baseball."
Well, I have some things that
could make baseball games a
little more exciting, for both
guys and girls.
Guys. We all love base
ball. But still some of us feel
that if the game was a taco it
could definitely use some
tabasco. Through careful
thought, investigation, inter
view, and analysis, I have come

up with some improvements
just for us guys.
Though baseball is the
epitomy of perfection, there
are some ways in which they
could better entertain the fans.
How many guys would show
up to a game if supermodels
wandered around the stadium
randomly locking lips with
fans? Wouldn't you go?
Or how about a free steak
to the male fan who can yell
the loudest obsenities at oppos
ing fielders? Lots of people
would pay good money if they
knew that they could come to
the ball park and get sides of
beef for being rambuncious.
Wouldn't you?
Or finally, free nachos
and beer during the seventh
inning stretch to the fan who

can belch the tune to "Take me
out to the ball game." Sounds
promising.
Ladies, Ladies. Would
you go to a ball game if all of
the players were forced to wear
extra tight pants revealing their
round, yet athletic buttocks?
That would be incentive, right?
How about free
babysitting of the kids for the
wife who can recall the actual
number of times that her hus
band has told his favorite team
he loves them instead of tell
ing her he loves her? Money.
Ladies what about the ul
timate in incentives: an all ex
penses paid night with
Leonardo DiCaprio to the fe
male baseball enthusiast who
can eat 5 hotdogs, a box of
crakerjacks, a pretzel, and chug

a soda before her husband?
Marvelous. Now what woman
in her right mind would not go
to see the Phillies versus the
Mets if it meant meeting Leo?
None, and attendance would
skyrocket.
So, although watching
baseball is like watching T.S.
Eliot compose poetry, baseball
fans can sometimes be bored.
Write to your favortie major
league team and tell them that
the easter bunny is here, and
he needs some hot dogs.

Bullets shoot-down Fords but are pecked by Gulls

by Henry Fawell
Assistant News Editor
For the second consecu
tive week, the Gettysburg
men's lacrosse team racked up
a decisive victory early on, but
failed to win the big game
against the weekend's high
profile' opponent. Thus,
Wednesday's 23-7 drubbing of
Haverford College proved
short-lived, as No. 4 ranked
Salisbury State buried the Bul
lets at Musselman Stadium on
Saturday under the score 16-9.

Wednesday's victory
against Haverford gave fans
every indication of a big week.
Despite a slow start, which
found the Bullets up only 4-3
after one period, ten players
were able to score for the Bul
lets as they outshot their oppo
nent 63 to 25 by game's end.
The Bullets' starting at
tack made sure to help them
selves to the net, as they com
bined to score ' 16 of
Gettysburg's 23 goals, while
handing eight assists.

Jamie Bateman and Ross
Garretson each scored seven
goals, marking the first time in
schpol history two players have
accomplished the feat in the
same game. Bateman tied his

career high, while Garretson
topped his previous best of five,
set earlier this season. '
Scott Lowery provided
yet another solid performance,
ringing the net twice and dish
ing out three assists. The senior
captain has now contributed at
least a goal or an assist in 26
consecutive games, dating all
the way back to the 1996 sea¬

son. Brian Abbot, the junior
defenseman known around the
league for his defensive skills,
added yet another dimension to
his game as he ripped in his first
career goal.
But Wednesday's mo
mentum failed to carry into the
weekend, as national power
house Salisbury State put an
end to the dramatics that have
typified past matches with Get
tysburg. Since 1996, three of
the four meetings between the
two teams have ended in one
goal games, including last
year's overtime victory for the
Bullets in the NCAA tourna
ment. The Sea Gulls, 8-1 in'98,
jumped out a 2-1 advantage in
the first minute of play. By the
time Jamie Bateman scored the
Bullets' first goal, Salisbury had
stormed out in front 7-1. Get
tysburg came within four goals

of Salisbury in the second quar
ter, but could not solve the Sea
Gull offense, which tallied the
highest scoring output against
the Bullets all year.
Jamie Bateman again led
the Bullets in scoring as he
notched three assists in the loss.

(6) hustle for a loose ball.

Cote, who is just back from
ankle surgery, contributed two
goals as well.
While the Bullets' record
stands at only 4-3, every loss
has come at the hands of a team
ranked in the top 6 of Division
III. This Saturday's matchup
against 4th ranked Washington

College will prove crucial in the
race for the Centennial Confer
ence crown, as well as the
season's final standings. But
until then, the Bullets will have
to settle with the No. 9 rank
ing in Division III, a spot they
presently share with Cortland
State.



Tennis teams have no love for conference rivals

by Bev Freda-Jackson and Jodi
Schmidt Contributing Reporters
The women's tennis team
began the season with a Spring
Break trip to Hilton Head. The
members of the team that went
on the trip were Masako
Yoshida, Tara Schmitt, Bev
Freda Jackson, Laura Bauer,
Emily Glatfelter, Kay
ConFrancesco, Jodi Schmidt,
Lisa Martilotta, Eileen Fortune
and Catherine Peters.
The team was very suc
cessful in South Carolina, post
ing 4-1 record. The only loss
came to George Mason. The
trip and tennis combined were
great preparation for the up
coming season. Thus far the
team is doing well and is unde
feated. A variation in line-up
due to injury and absence was
the case for the first few
matches of the season.

The opening match of the
season was against York Col
lege where the Lady Bullets
posted a 9-0 victory. Yoshida
led the team at first singles,
Jackson in 2nd, Bauer in 3rd,
Goodall in 4th, CoFrancesco in
5th and Glatfelter in the 6th
singles spot.
York forfeited #6 singles
and #3 doubles. The next two
matches versus Catholic Uni
versity and Muhlenburg were
a success for the Bullets with

9-0 and 8-1 victories, respec
tively. The earliest big match of
the season was against
Dickinson.
Tara Schmitt had a very
successful and strong return to
the line-up. The doubles teams
of Yoshida and Schmitt at #1,
Bauer and Glatfelter at #2 and
Jackson and Goodall at #3
swept the doubles, giving the
Bullets a sizable lead going into
single matches. One of the
most anticipated matches of the
season had the Bullets facing
Washington College.
The highlighted match
up of Masako Yoshida vs.
Annabel Flores proved to be
excellent tennis. Gettysburg
once again was victorious, post
ing an 8-1 victory over these
conference rivals. Since the
Bullets have defeated Bryn
Mawr College 9-0 and just yes
terday defeated Johns Hopkins
8-1.

The team is having a great
season with a 12-1 season
record. Singles and doubles
have been successful with
Yoshida and Schmitt teaming
up to make one of the stron
gest teams in the conference
and the team of Jackson and
Goodall are continuing their
win streak from last spring.
Next week will prove to be a
huge week for the Lady Bullets,
so come out and support their
rally to victory.

The niens tennif. team is
also in the midst of a great sea
son. The men opened up the
season with a victory over Mes
siah. Brandon Cutter led the
team at 1st singles, Chris
Rippey in 2nd, Wes Wells in
3rd, Pat Delaney in 4th, Dan
Vesci in 5th, and Chris Budden
in the 6th singles position.
Next, the men's tennis team
took on conference rivals
Haverford, Dickinson, and
Washington.
The men were successful
versus Haverford and
Dickinson, but fell to a strong
Washington College team.
The doubles play from the Bul
lets has been solid with Cutter
and Wells at #1, Rippey and
Delaney at #2 and Budden and
Vesci at #3. Ben Andreozzi
has also returned to singles and
doubles play this season after
coming off knee surgery last
year.

The men are about mid
way through the season. Johns
Hopkins is on the agenda this
week which should prove to be
a good match.
We wish them luck in the
following week and commend
them on their season thus far.
Their overall record of 6-2 is
indicative of their strong sea
son. The men's and women's
tennis teams are both coached

Destined for Vic-TORY; Lodge shows her stuff on field and in training room

Contributing Reporter/ BASS
member Tory Lodge is a returning
senior on the women's lacrosse
team, which is doing very well
right now with a record of 4-2
overall, and 4-1 in the confer
ence. Tory commented, "Ev
erything is really coming to
gether for us." They seem to

have a promising future with
such a young team this year,
only 3 seniors and 2 juniors.
Tory played lacrosse through
out high school, and was actu
ally a representative for the
state of Pennsylvania in the na
tional tournament.
The thing that is so inter
esting about Tory is that she is
an athlete as well as a student
trainer. She isn't able to do
much training when she is play
ing lax, but says that it is diffi
cult to be "in season" all year
long. "Most people don't seem
«*tQ_*j£alize that athletic training
takes up even more time than
actually playing a sport."
Tory loves training and
competing. She sees it as an
added bonus because if her
team's trainers aren't around,

everyone can come to her for
help, which she doesn't mind a
bit. "Being a trainer has al
lowed me to meet even more
people on campus that I never
would have otherwise," she
explained.
"I love my team—we all
get along so well and it's an
amazing feeling to experience
earned success with great
friends." This is what Tory
loves most about lacrosse. She
is grateful for the open-arm
welcome that she received af
ter returning from her semes
ter abroad last spring.
Tory was amazed at how
accepting the team was of her,
and the fact that not a single
teammate held a grudge. La
crosse has given her many
memories which she will al¬

ways carry with her. These
memories makes Gettysburg's
lacrosse program so worth
while. Tory kept coming back
for more, year after year, and
it was interesting to discover
her incentive.
"Besides my teammates,
it is defense that kept me com
ing back year after year! It's
the best feeling, making an in
terception, denying my girl the
ball, preventing her from go
ing around the crease...I swear,
I must have been born a de
fender because I love it so
much."
Tory once told me that
many people don't ever realize
that she is a lacrosse player. I
was curious to know why, and
wondered if it bothered her.
She said, "It doesn't bother me

at all. I think it's because we
defenders don't get the stats
everyone hears about. This is
fine by me—we all know how
much we contribute to the
team's success. We don't need
outside recognition to under
stand this."
Tory is also involved in
several other activities on cam
pus such as Alpha Delta Pi, and
the Student Trainer's Club
where she is the clubs secretary
She was just recently nomi
nated for Phi Beta Kappa.
Tory has accomplished a
phenomenal amount. There are
few student-athletes who
would be able to manage as
busy a schedule. Tory, we com
mend you for your efforts and
your accomplishments both on
and off the field.


Hitting the "Jake-pot"

One of the finest athletic carrers in the history of Gettysburg College is finally coming to a
close, but none of the students on this campus would trade any of the memories Jake Dell
gave them...not even for a million dollars.

tournaments which enabled
him to compete in the National
Division III Wrestling Champi
onships his sophomore, junior
and senior years. Due to Dell's
outstanding sixth, second and
fourth place finishes, respec
tively, at the National tourna
ment each year, he was a named
a three time All-American.
Despite all that Jake Dell
has accomplished he is still one
of the most humble and warm

by Chesha Miller
Assistant Sports Editor

It all began twelve years
ago when Jake Dell's older
brother Troy began his wres
tling career. The older Dell
would come home after prac
tice and spend hours teaching
his little brother various wres
tling moves.
Immediately a passion for
the sport was instilled in Jake.
That passion and love of wres
tling, given to Jake by his older
brother and closest friend, has
shaped him into the person he
is today.
Jake attributes all his suc
cesses to his coach of twelve
years, his brother Troy. "He has
taught me everything I know,"

Dave Wilson would not be re
turning to Gettysburg. Jake
and his fellow teammates were
nervous about the transition
and were hoping that the pro
gram would remain the same.
The team was very lucky to
have Coach Wilson's shoes
more than amply filled by Troy
Dell, Jake's first and now last
coach.
Troy returned to Gettys
burg, where he had been an

Jake commented.
"Jake is so successful be
cause of his work ethic and
ability to stay focused on goals
over a long period of time,"
Troy explained. "He has ac
complished really great things."
As soon as Jake was big
enough to wrestle with his
older brother, Troy worked
with him to help make Jake the
talented wrestler he is. Most
importantly Troy instilled con
fidence in Jake. He explained,
"I always believed in him and
when he first came to college I
told him it's never loo early to
win here. I now hear him tell
ing the younger wrestlers the
same thing."

"Wrestling has definitely been
a way of life for me. It shaped
the person I am today. It taught
me hard work, to set goals for
myself, how to win, and how
to loose," Jake explained. "But,
most importantly, it gave me a
sense of what I can do as a per
son and what I can accom
plish." Reflecting on his years at
Gettysburg, Jake talked about
the constant support he felt

from the campus community.
This season as he was prepar
ing for nationals, Jake was re
ally amazed at all the support
and well wishes he received
from the campus. "It was re
ally great knowing I was going
out there with so many people
behind me. The support was
another driving force for me."
The continual support
from Gettysburg's campus is
nothing new to Jake. As a first
year student, Dell won the Cen
tennial Championship at 158
lbs. The tournament that year,
which was held at Gettysburg,
remains one of Jake's fondest
Lind most vivid wrestling
memories.
In the finals Dell was to

people you will ever meet. As
former Gettysburg wrestling
coach Dave Wilson com
mented, "Jake is one of the
most respectful, courteous and
nice young men I ' ve ever
known."
According to Troy Dell,
Jake is extremely dependable
and always willing to help
people. Jake is a very dedicated
athlete who never allowed his
social life to get in front of his
wrestling career. Dell also
found a wonderful balance be
tween his academics and ath
letics, and was therefore able
to succeed in both.
This August, the Bullet
wrestlers found themselves
without a coach, as Coach

assistant coach Jake's sopho
more year, to coach his former
team and also his younger
brother, Jake, in his very last
year of wrestling. "Troy was the
first person I wanted to get the
job," explained the younger
Dell. "He has always been my
coach and I felt really comfort
able having him here." The
transition from brothers to
coach and athlete was easily
made by the Dell brothers. "It
was an excellent opportunity
for me both professionally and
personally," explained Coach
Troy Dell. "I had the ability to
be with Jake for one last year."
In twelve years of compe
tition, Jake has gained an enor
mous amount from wrestling.

It was never too early for
Jake to win at Gettysburg. He
began his tremendous winning
career the very first season he
stepped out onto Gettysburg's
mats. Jake holds the record for
the most pins in a season (17)
and has repeatedly broken his
own record for most wins in a
season, which he bettered to 40
this season. Dell is one of only
two Centennial Conference
wrestlers to have ever claimed
four consecutive conference
titles. In addition, the 167 Ib.
senior wrestler has won three
consecutive NCAA Regional

*_fc

wrestle an opponent who had
beaten him earlier in the sea
son. With three seconds left in
the third period Jake was down
by one point. He escaped to
tie up the match and secured
the conference title in double
overtime. "It was really nice to
have the home crowd advan
tage," he explained. The
people of Gettysburg stood be
hind Jake and wished him well,
just as they did this past sea
son. If you listen closely you
can still hear them cheering.
Wrestling has been a
staple in Jake Dell's life.
Though Jake has finished his

career as an athlete, the sport
has not seen the last of Jake
Dell. If all works out, and Troy
Dell, who filled an interim po
sition this season, is asked back
to coach the Bullets, Jake will
remain at Gettysburg next year
as the assistant wrestling coach.
"I feel myself making the
transition from athlete to
coach," Jake explained. "I
didn't leave [my wrestling ca
reer] with an empty feeling, but
the feeling of a start of some
thing new." Jake hopes to re
turn to Gettysburg in the fall
in order to help the Bullet wres
tlers attain all their goals.

Coaching together would
be another step in the progres
sion for the Dell brothers. "It
would be great," concluded
Troy, "Jake is the person I con
sult with a lot now as it is."
The Dell brothers have
now come full circle. Twelve
years ago Troy Dell taught Jake
Dell every wrestling move he
knew, having no idea as he
coached his little brother that
one day he would have the op
portunity to coach that not-so
little brother on the collegiate
level. Another chapter is now
closed in the wrestling career
of Jake Dell. But the book is
far from over, and one thing is
certain, no matter what hap
pens, with Jake Dell as the
hero, the ending is sure to be
great.

Dole speaks to packed house
Hundreds denied entrance to former presidential candidate's speech

by Rebecca Babbitt
Staff Reporter Former Senator arid GOP presi
dential candidate Robert Dole was on
campus Monday night. Dole, 1995
winner of the Eisenhower Leadership
Prize, spoke at two sessions and visited
with students at a dinner in his honor.
Dole was raised in Russell, Kan
sas and served in the Tenth Mountain
Division during World War II. He was
wounded in battle and decorated twice
for heroic achievement. Dole was a
nominee for Vice President and served
in the House of Representatives. He is
one of 16 men to serve as Senate Ma
jority Leader.
The Eisenhower Leadership Prize
is an award given by Gettysburg Col
lege and the Eisenhower World Affair
institute. The Award includes a
$25,000 prize that Dole donated to
Kansas Wesleyan University.

Dole had a question and answer
session for selected students at 5 p.m.
Many campus leaders and political sci
ence majors asked questions ranging
from the impact of the religious right
in the 1996 presidential campaign to
who might run for president in 2000.
At the evening session open to all
students and the public, Dole spoke at
length about his admiration of
Eisenhower and the need for honesty
and integrity in leadership.
Both sessions were packed with
students, press, and community mem
bers. Two hundred and fifty students
filled Mara Auditorium at the 5 o'clock
question and answer session. The
o'clock session filled the CUB ballroom

Bob Dole talked about issues of character and leadership Monday night in
the Ballroom.

dred would-be audience members.
"Eisenhower is my hero," said
Dole. "You could trust him." Dole
credited Eisenhower with being "con
cerned about the broad middle. He
wasn't worried about special interests."
Dole characterized a good leader
as someone with "integrity, honesty,
loyalty, and character." He added that
these are "endearing qualities" that
don't change.
At both sessions Dole encouraged
youth involvement in politics and skill
fully avoided criticisms of the current
administration.

"Young people ought to be in poli
tics, it is your future," Dole said. "Your
generation is going to pay the tab if
things aren't done right now."
Dole continually declined to an
swer questions about his opinion of the
Clinton presidency, saying that he was
not here to criticize. When asked about
Kenneth Starr and the independent
council, Dole said it is time to "get it
done, get it over with, and move on."
Dole proved to be very humorous.
When asked whether his wife Elizabeth
would run for president in 2000, Dole
said "it's my last chance to get to the
White House."

Dole also spoke highly of the Re
publican party. "It's a good idea party,"
he said. "We need to get our platform
out there and talk about it."
Dole ended his speech on a posi
tive note. "I really believe that we are
the greatest country in the world be
cause of our people-because we like to
get things done." Dole said the Ameri
cans are full of "generosity and com
passion." He concluded, "I think our
future is extremely bright."

Dole signs
Communist Manifesto

by Rebecca Babbitt
Staff Reporter
Most people would be
happy just to have Bob Dole's
signature, but not Paul
Hutchinson.
The senior history ma
jor was reading Karl Marx's
Communist Manifesto in the
college radio station, when he
saw Dole walk by.
Hutchinson was able to catch
the former senator and GOP
presidential candidate on his
way to dinner.
"I had come up with the
idea to have him sign the
Communist Manifesto about
an hour and a half earlier,"
said Hutchinson.
When Hutchinson

asked him to sign the book
Dole asked why Hutchinsoi
wanted him to sign Marx's bes
know work. Hutchinson, a sel
proclaimed "flaming liberal,'
told the prominent Republicai
that his signature "would pu
some value in it."
Dole chuckled and said
"It needs it."
"It was the greatest prac
tical joke I've ever pulled in mj
life," said Hutchinson, whc
wrote his version of the storj
inside the cover of the book
"I'll tuck it away somewhere
and give it to my kids someday
-it is a treasure of history," saic
Hutchinson.
"I really like the guy," saic
Hutchinson of Dole. "He is i
great American."

Students attempt to take back the night
Action group formed to combat sexual assault on campus

by Cara Masucci
Staff Reporter The statistics can be
alarming. We've all heard
them. Men and women, no
one is immune. Sexual assault
seems to become more and
more prevalent in society. With
all the horrific facts we hear, it
can seem as though there is no
light at the end of the tunnel.
One group on campus, though,
is trying to change this and
bring about the means to the
end of sexual assault at
Gettysburg College.
The group, loosely re
ferred to as the "action group"
had its start a little over three
months ago when co-directors
cf the Women's Center, Abby
Rodgers and Becky Card,
looked around and decided the
campus needed to come to
gether to curb the growing
number of incidents of sexual

assault on campus. Card
stated, "It was not a single in
cident [that started the group],
but an accumulation of events."
Card pointed out that
when she and Rodgers met at
the end of last semester, they
noticed a lack of cooperative
action on the campus in deal
ing with all forms of sexual as
sault. The two directors de
cided to set a goal for the
present semester, and make it
successful and strong enough to
carry on in the coming years.
• The group is made up of
a large congregation of women
and men from many different
aspects of college life, includ
ing students, support staff, and
faculty. The large amount of
diversity among members of
the action group allows for
many different ideas about pro
gramming and ways to, reach
the campus.

According to a student
member of the group who
joined because of her own ex
perience with sexual assault,
the campus needs to become
more aware that rape and oth¬

ers forms of sexual assault do
happen. The woman became
involved because she wanted
to educate people and prevent
it from happening to others.
The college is not immune.
The statistics hold true on this
campus, even though we can
sometimes assume we live in a
bubble.

Each week on this campus, approximately ten women are sexually assaulted.The newly formed
action group on campus is working to fight this problem. Meetings are every other Wednesday
night; call the Women's Center at x6991 for more information.

One of the main goals of
the group is to make the dis
cussion of sexual assault open
and to educate the campus on
issues of prevention and sup
port for those directly affected
by sexual assault. Another goal
is making the victims aware
that there are people out there
to help them and aid them.
To accomplish the above
goals, the group has plastered
the campus with posters, rib
bons, banners, and survival
stories. Walking across the
campus, one cannot escape
purple ribbons tied around
trees as a symbol for how many
people have been victim to
sexual assault.

There will also be a table
located in the CUB throughout
the week containing informa
tion about campus resources,
books on prevention and cop
ing, as well as a wall where
people have told their own sto
ries of crisis.
According to the action
group, the first day alone pro¬

vided a full wall of stories. Card
stated that although it is unfor
tunate to see the true number
of cases of sexual'assault on
campus, it demonstrates the
need for improvement and pre
vention of it on campus.
The group also held a
Take Back the Night rally last
night on Musselman Library
steps to raise support.
The action group is also
presently working with Cheers
to slam the campus with infor
mation. According to Alec
Beekmans, a senior member of
the action group, "We are work
ing with Cheers to combat and
build a defense against sexual
assault on this campus."

First year student
Miranna Smith likes the idea of
the involvement with Cheers
because it will be geared to
wards first year students who
can be the main targets for rape
and other forms of sexual as
sault. Beekmans's involvement
also points to a significant goal

Photo by Emily _Glatfeltei

of the group. Sometimes all
people see or think about is the
man as the aggressor and the
woman as the victim. The ac
tion group realizes this error
and, as Card puts it, "We are
not out there to ostracize men."
Men, as the group points out,
are victims too, and are affected
by rape just as women are. The
action group wants to see more
people, particularly men, in
volved in the process to elimi
nate assault.
If you think a friend has
been raped, there are signs to
look for. Thirty-one percent of
all victims suffer from Rape
Related Post Traumatic Stress
Disorder (RR-PTSD). The

symptoms of this include fear,
helplessness, shock, disbelief,
guilt, humiliation, embarrass
ment, anger, self-blame, flash
backs of the rape, avoidance of
previously pleasurable activi
ties, avoidance of the place or
circumstance in which the rape
occurred, depression, sexual
dysfunction, insomnia, and
impaired memory.
Based on U.S. Census re
ports on the number of women
in the United States, 1.3 mil
lion women currently have RR
PTSD, 3.8 million women have
previously had RR-PTSD and
roughly 211,000 women will
develop RR-PTSD each year.
Victims often pull away
from intimate relationships or,
alternatively, become regres
sively fearful, clingy, and needy.
Be sure to support your friend,
though, as when compared
with nonvictims, rape victims
have been found to be 8.7 times

more likely to attempt suicide.
If you know that a friend
has been sexually assaulted,
encourage him or her to seek
medical treatment immedi
ately. Most victims don't seek
medical care during the criti
cal 72 hours after the attack,
making gathering evidence of
the attack next to impossible.
Only 16% of rapes are
ever reported to the police.
Most believe that nothing can
be done, with other reasons
being that the victims felt it was
a private matter, they were

afraid of police response, and
others felt it was not important
enough.
If anyone is interested in
joining the action group, they
can sign up in the CUB all this
week, or call the Women's Cen
ter at x6991. The group meets
every other Wednesday night in
the Women's Center at 6:30.
The group hopes to boost in
terest in it and wants to elimi
nate the occurrence of rape and
other sexual assault from the
campus. All are welcome and
encouraged to join.




Fungi at Gettysburg

Contributing Reporter
"I seem to have been only
a boy playing on the seashore,
and diverting myself in now
and then finding a smoother
pebble or a prettier shell than
ordinary, whilst the great ocean
of truth lay all undiscovered
before me."
-Sir Isaac Newton (1642
1727) If you happen to hear a
peculiar noise echoing in the
Biology Department of
Gettysburg College, it is most
likely Dr. A. Ralph Cavaliere.
You can ask any one of his col
leagues about the dominant
trait of Dr. Cavaliere and the

answer .
"It would have to be that
noise he makes," one col
league says.
"Anyone who _^B
knows him will recog- _^^
nize the silent inhal- _^^^
ing whistle." _^^^H
Cheryl Vogel, _^^^
Laboratory _^^^^^H
Technician of _^^^^^^H
the Biology _^^^^^^
Department,. _^^^^^^^H
said that he _^^^^^^^
makes the _^^^^^^^_J
noise of- _^^^^^^^^^
ten when ^^^_f_^^^^^H
he is ^^^^^^^^^H
pleased with a ^^^^B
student's work. Ac¬

cording to her, many mutter,
"this is so great, Dr. Cavaliere
is going to hyperventilate."
Dr. Cavaliere's love for
both science and teaching shine
through this noise. You will be
able to locate good scientists in
any lab, but scientists who love
their students as much as Dr.
Cavaliere are one in a million.
When Dr. Cavaliere took
an interest in plants, he was
merely a little boy, as was New
ton when his eyes were opened
up to the atom. This childhood
interest swept him all the way
out to sea to his first research
project in Iceland. It was there
that he met up with an erupt
ing volcano that was in the pro
cess of forming an island.
Here, in 1963, he observed
marine organisms, all the while
searching for a "prettier shell
than ordinary."
Although this was very

intriguing research, Dr.
Cavaliere felt that it was time
tor a change. "I remember it
Was very cold in Iceland," said
Cavaliere. "If I ever do a
project like this again, I want it
to be in Bermuda, and lo and
behold, fifteen years later, I was
in Bermuda."
With the help of many
grants, Dr. Cavaliere went on
to an even more productive
project in Bermuda. With the
warm waters of Bermuda be
fore him, Dr. Cavaliere's career
was taken to new heights. With
its unique protected inshore
waters, including extensive
sounds, bays, and marine
ponds,the opportunities for
*—. studying marine

flora and fauna
were infinite.
According to
one of the field
guides he
authored, the
protected in
shore waters
"harbor a rich
and beautiful
variety of
marine life
_^ t hat is
quite dif
ferent from
' the off
shore
_A flora and
fauna associ
ated with the
Many of these

reefs."
organisms can be observed
merely by snorkeling or walk
ing along the shore.
Based upon his extensive
research' on the islands of Ber
muda, Dr. Cavaliere has pub
lished a multitude of books,
field guides, and articles.
Among these publications, are
The Marine Algae of Bermuda
and The Field Guide to the
Conspicuous Flora and Fauna
of Bermuda, both of which are
published by the Bermuda Bio
logical Station for Research.
He has been collaborating with
the Director of the Natural
Museum of Bermuda on a six
year project entitled The
Seaweeds and Seaside Plants of
Bermuda.

Be still my beating heart

by Greg Bellanca and Jen Sabo
Contributing Reporters
Learning how to measure
your heart rate at rest, during
exercise, and after exercise is
easy and practical. Your heart
rate can serve as a useful foun
dation for various exercise pro
grams.
There exist several ana
tomical sights that can be pal
pated to determine heart rate.
The carotid artery in the neck
and the radial artery (thumb
side) in the wrist are the most

resting heart rate than a seden
tary person. Aerobic exercise
performed three times a week
for twenty minutes has been
shown to benefit the resting
heart rate. There are several
other factors that affect heart
rate besides exercise, including
medications, disease, and age.
Measuring the heart rate
during exercise is a good index
of how hard the heart is work
ing and the intensity of the ex
ercise session. Achieving a cer
tain intensity level is the goal

of an exercise session. The
term target heart rate range is
used to denote heart activity
high enough to induce cardio
vascular benefits.
The target heart rate
range of typical college stu
dents is between 120 beats per
minute and 200 beats per
minute. To determine your ap
proximate target heart rate
range, complete the following
formula:
Step 1: 220 - (your age)
= maximum HR
Step 2: (max HR) x .60

common and convenient sights
for measuring heart rate.
In order to determine
your heart rate, place your in
dex and middle fingers over the
carotid or radial arteries. The
throbs you feel correspond ex
actly to the beats of the heart.
The beats can be counted for
ten seconds and then multiplied
by six.
The resting heart rate av
erage is usually between 50-90
beats per minute. A physically
fit individual will have a lower

= lowest HR for exercising
Step 3: (max HR) x .80
= highest HR for exercising
Once you are well into
your aerobic conditioning pro
gram, you will notice that your
exercise heart rate is lower than
it was during the early phases
of training. This decrease in
dicates that the heart is becom
ing more efficient through
training. In other words, your
heart is not working as hard to
accomplish a certain task.
When the exercise bout is
finished, your heart rate does
not instantly return to its rest
ing level. The time it takes for
an elevated heart rate to return
to resting levels is referred to
as the heart rate recovery pe
riod. The heart rate returns to
its resting level more quickly as
a result of endurance training.
A more physically fit person
recovers faster after exercise
than a less fit individual.

Measuring and keeping
track of the heart rate period
is an excellent parameter for
progress evaluation.


Hair Grease and poodle skirts

In Case You Missed It

by Eileen O'Donnell
Movie Columnist
In 1978, the stage play
Grease hit the big screen. Last
week it was rereleased in movie
theaters and drive-ins across
the country. The film boasts a
big name cast, starring Satur
day Night Fever heartthrob

John Travolta and
Australian pop star
Olivia Newton
John as the lovers.
Danny
(Travolta) and
Sandy (Newton
Jbhn) enjoyed a
summer romance
the summer before
their senior year of
high school. They
said good-bye at the
end of the summer

as Sandy was on her way back
to Australia. But by some twist
of fate, her family wound up
staying, and Sandy faces her
first day of school at Rydell
High. Little does she know
that Danny is also a student
there. Sandy nervously goes
through her first day and be
comes friends with Frenchy
(Didi Conn), one of the Pink
Ladies. At lunch she meets the
rest of the girls and tells them
of her summer love. Mean
while, on the bleachers at the
football field, Danny is regal
ing his fellow T-Birds with sto¬

ries of his summer fling. The
song ends with their images
against a sunset.
After meeting Sandy at a
pep rally, Danny realizes he has
to keep up appearances in front
of his friends. He can't act like
the sweet and innocent boy
Sandy knows from the summer.
His crude, macho behavior

confuses Sandy. Frenchy has an
idea: why not give Sandy a
makeover? So the Pink Ladies
have a sleepover and invite
Sandy, asking her to dye her
hair and pierce her ears. This
brings about the best song in
the whole musical. Rizzo
(Stockard Channing) breaks
out into "Look At Me, I'm
Sandra Dee," while Sandy is
out of the room.
Danny and Sandy try to
make their relationship work,
but they are so different that it
seems impossible. Then each
comes up with a plan to win
the other over for good. Both

Danny and Sandy try to change
to suit the other. The real les
son learned by the end of the
film is to be yourself; you don't
need to change for anyone.
Just about everybody has
seen Grease and can croon
along with the gang. Grease
pays tribute to the way it was,
evoking feelings of nostalgia
_^^_hm_^^_m for bobby \

ii/i ujuu y
soxers and
drive-ins. But
for we Gen
eration Xers,
who don't
know first
hand the sim
plicity of
poodle skirts
and saddle
shoes, Grease
is a window to
the world of

drive-ins and malt shops.
The supporting cast also
has some famous names:
Lorenzo Lamas (from TV's
Renegade), Jeff Conaway (who
was in the original Broadway
cast as well as being on TV's
Taxi), Stockard Channing {Moll
Flanders), Frankie Avalon, Sid
Caesar, and Eve Arden.
The best thing about
Grease is the music. The tunes
are catchy, and the lyrics are
simple and fun. This is a film
that everybody will enjoy. So
if you can't find it in a theater
near you, rent it this weekend
for a rockin' good time.

Years of laborious study were
necessary to even come close to
the "great ocean of truth" de
scribed by Newton. He re
ceived both his Bachelor of Sci
ence and Master of Science
degrees in Biology from Ari
zona State University. Dr.
Cavaliere then went on to
Duke University, where, in
1965, he received his Ph.D.

- continued from page 6 -
with a major in Botany and a
minor in Zoology. His areas of
specialization included Mycol
ogy, Marine Fungi, and Marine
Algae.
In beginning his studies,
Cavaliere was given "a great big
fungus" to start him on his re
search. Dr. Cavaliere took the
fungus home and sauteed it in
butter, garlic, and oil. The next
day, his professor asked about
what research he had come up
with. Dr. Cavaliere responded,
"I took it home and ate it." His

professor replied, "Boy, a hell
of a biologist you're going to
make." He was right. Dr.
Cavaliere has made a hell of a
biologist after all.
Following his gradutaion,
Dr. Cavaliere taught at Duke as
the Visiting Assistant Professor
of Botany. He then went on to
Gettysburg, where his teaching
was not limited to the standard
school year. He spent his sum
mers as a faculty member at the
Duke University Marine Labo
ratory and at the Bermuda Bio
logical Station for Research.

Someone once said that
"a teacher affects eternity, he
can never tell where his influ
ence stops." With his knowl
edge of both science and art,

Dr. Cavaliere has opened the
eyes of countless students.
With the help of his field
guides, now others can "play
on the seashore" as Newton
once did and Dr. Cavaliere
now does.
Years ago, Dr. Robert
Barnes, then Chairman of the
Biology Department, hired Dr.
Cavaliere to teach an under
graduate course in physiology
Dr. Cavaliere did not believe
he would be capable of teach
ing a course in a field other

than his own, but has proven
himself worthy of the job. To
day he teaches courses in Gen
eral Biology, Electron Micros
copy, and the Physiology of
Plant Adaptations.
A few of Dr. Cavaliere's
students have even gone on to
greatness. Dave Hartman was
the first blind student ever to
be admitted to an American
Medical School. Also, two of
his students, one of whom was
his advisee, received McArthur
fellowships.

Dr. Cavaliere's ability to
enlighten others, as well as his
pleasant personality, are evi
dent in the words of his col
leagues. According to Janice
Diehl, the Biology Department

secretary, "his ability to encour
age students to learn" is his best
quality. "He never forces you
to learn, but he makes it so
much fun, you just want to."
When asked about Dr.
Cavaliere, Dr. Hendrix replied,
"He is a fine person to be with
as a colleague; We enjoy work
ing with him. If you're doing
something wrong, he will tell
you, and if you're doing some
thing right, he will tell you."
Professor Hirazumai feels
the same way. "He is a fun pro
fessor to be around as a col
league, and students are lucky
to have him as a lecturer."
Perhaps the following
words of Professor Hirazumai
sum up Dr. Cavaliere the best.
"His love of and love for sci
ence is genuine, and anyone
who has known him will rec
ognize it."

When asked what his
greatest contribution to science
has been, Dr. Cavaliere re
sponded, "No one has ever
asked me that before." He feels
that his greatest contribution
has been, "to be able to take
concepts of biology and teach
them in a way that science and
nonscience students alike can
understand them."

Reel Hits & Misses
More fun than a barrel of animatronic monkeys

by Dan Larkin and Mike Petro
Movie Columnists
Dan: 1 never thought I'd
say this, but the monkey was
the worst part of the movie.
But I'm getting ahead of myself
here. Mike: My friend here is
right, the monkey was really
bad. Imagine Roger Rabbit
trying to pass as a real being
and you might get a vague idea
of what this effect is like.
Lost in Space, the cin
ematic update of the frighten
ingly campy sixties space-corn,
is a bit of a mixed bag in this
new adaptation.
All of the basic elements
of the Space Family Robinson
are left more or less intact. The
sci fi geeks out there will be glad
to see that the Robot and Dr.
Smith and Will and Penny and
Judy and Mom and Dad and
that other guy are all still there.

Lost in Space has the ben
efit of strong, if somewhat bi
zarre, casting. Dr. John
Robinson, the family patriarch,
is played by William Hurt
(Dark City, Kiss of the
SpiderWoman). Like most
characters he plays, Hurt's
Robinson is detached and aloof
until something makes him
"come around." This role is a
bit less dramatic than Hurt usu
ally plays, but he does a good
job with a pretty easy part. _r
Gary Oldman (Dracula,
The Scarlet Letter) does an ad
mirable job trying to dupli
cate Jonathan Harris' campy
Dr. Smith. The portrayal of Dr.
Smith in the movie falls short
of its mark, but this is due much
more to the script than to any
shortcomings on Oldman's
part.

Smith is made to be much
too villainous in the movie
Harris' Smith was opportunis¬

tic and cowardly, but he was
never evil.
It took me a couple of
years before I realized that Matt
LeBlanc (Ed) and Matthew
Perry on Friends were two sepa
rate people, so I guess that
LeBlanc was a pretty good
choice to play the everyman pi
lot, Don West. LeBlanc is not
much of an actor, but he doesn't
have to do too much here. He
doesn't hurt the movie.
The casting is really well
done. I like the way that you
can believe that the cast mem
bers are really a family. Hurt
and Rodgers are the believeable
parents, and the kids are midly
disfunctional, a perfect 90's
adaptation. -
Like any TV show from
the sixties, the women on the
original Lost in Space had no
personalities. Director Stephen
Hopkins attempts to remedy
this, making Mom (Mimi

Rodgers) and Judy (Heathet
Graham) into scientists instead
of just girls along for the ride.
There's some tension in the
Robinson marriage. Judy has
problems getting in touch with
her emotions. Penny feels ne
glected and unloved. But the
women still don't do anything,
leaving the all the real action
to the men and the Robot
(original voice of Dick Tufield),
just like the old series. So much
for progress.
Despite a lack of depth,
the movie is pretty fun and a
visual treat. Particularly
memorable is a scene where
Will Robinson commands the
Robot through a kind of V.R
remote control.
The effects are really well
done in this movie. I read that
this movie has more computer
special effects than any other
in history. Watch it and you'll
believe that to be true. I en¬

joyed the lush scenery and the
seamless computer animation.
This movie represents a big
step forward in special effects.
What came really close to
ruining the movie for me was
the inclusion of a cutesy com
puter-animated space monkey
as a friend for Penny. I like
monkeys as much as the next
guy (okay, maybe a little more
than the next guy), but this
thing was really annoying. This
creature fails in comparison to
the time honored legacy of sci
ence fiction monkeys (Dr.
Zaius, Gleek, etc.). But, over
all, Lost in Space is a good time.
Two and three quarter stars (out
of five).
If he likes monkeys as
much as the next guy, well
then, call me the next guy! I
liked this movie, it's a good
time and worth the price of
admission. Two and a half
stars out of five.


Library BULLETin

by Libby Musselman
Library Columnist
Q: The library is open
24 hours from Sunday-Friday,
but what does that really
mean? I mean, the building
is open, but other stuff isn't,
what's the deal?
A: The building being
open means there is access to
library materials, study space,
and the student computer lab.
It also means that one library
staff member is here to over
see the library and to check
out materials to students.
There are also a lot of services
which are not available all
night long because of staffing.

Q: Is it too late to sign up
for an RPC?
Heck, no. It only takes
about 24 hour notice. You
should sign up in the blue book
on the reference desk in the li
brary-just give them 24 hours
between the time you fill out the
request and the time you want
the appointment. A Research
Paper Consultation is that first
invaluable step in turning out a
great paper. Appointments may
be made between 10 a.m. and
noon Monday through Thurs
day, and between 2 p.m. and 4
p.m., Monday through Friday. If
none of these times are conve¬

nient for you, special appoint
ments may also be arranged.
During the consultation, the li
brarian will discuss with you
strategies for finding the most
relevant resources for your topic.
Libbv's tip of the week:
"Freshmen shall at no time wear
white trousers and shall at all
times wear only plain black socks
and black neckties." These and
other words of advice are on dis
play in the Freshman G-books in
the exhibit cases on the main
floor of the library. Stop in and
see the archive's collection of
dinks—and if you don't know
what a dink is, you'll have to
read the G-book!

Here are the hours of the
other services: Evening ref
erence help and media ser
vices are provided until 10
p.m., Sunday through Thurs
day. Special Collections closes
at 4:30 most days but is open
until 9 p.m. on Wednesday
You can drop off an interli
brary loan request anytime
but the staff leaves at 4:30.
The computer help desk
closes at 6 p.m. and the stu
dent computer hotline is
staffed until 10 p.m. You
might be surprised that we are
open 104 hours per week,
which, according to a recent
survey, is more hours than any
other liberal arts college in the
U.S.

WORDS!!! The Dole enchilada

by Christina Dickert
Columnist Did you ever notice how
words surround our lives? I
know that sounds really dense,
but I never did. It was some
thing that I totally took for
granted. But now, with ten
school days left before finals, it
seems as though those words are
everywhere. I feel as though I
am being suffocated and at
tacked by little clauses and let
ters!! HELP!!
Maybe I'm exaggerating
just the tiniest bit. I feel this way
because I have so much reading
to do. (I know I'm not the only
one, so let's relate.) And if it's
not words to read out of my
textbooks, it's words to write for
one of my numerous papers.
Doesn't it ever stop?

I am one of those people
whose mind, after reading about
50 pages in a book, my mind
starts to wander and the words
start to blur. So I raise my weary
head from the oh-so-interesting
book that I was reading to stare
blankly at the shelf above the li
brary desk that I am sitting at.
My dreams of getting to stare
blankly at nothing but wood are
dashed as I begin to read the
curious scribbling of my prede
cessors of this desk. Wow. "I
got baked at SPRING BREAK
"98." Exciting. Thanks for in
forming me. There is an apol
ogy scrawled on my right, and a

religious quote carefully written
beneath it. Fine, free expression
is just great. But no more
words!! Seriously, I don't think
that it makes any sense to
scribble when you are tired of
either reading or writing other
words.
Then, my favorite time of
night comes along. It usually
happens between midnight and
1 a.m. It begins when you start
reading- you know you are read
ing something because your eyes
are moving- but what did you
just read? I usually give up after
reading the same paragraph four
times and I can't remember any
words except "the." This means
that my brain has checked out
for the night, and, if I want to
learn anymore, I'll have to save
it for tomorrow, after I sleep.
Most of the time, I am very
happy when this special signal
:omes along, because it means
that it is time to pack up and go
to bed.

Maybe my brain is filled to
capacity. I mean, what more can
I learn? I know I am only a
freshman, but I feel so burned
out already. Most of the seniors
encounter tell me that I am
lucky. It only gets harder from
where I stand. Great. That's
really what I want to hear. But I
just want to point out one more
time that there are TEN MORE
DAYS OF CLASSES!!!! I think
[ can make it without going to
tally nuts. I hope you can too.

Political Columnist
On Monday, Senator Bob
Dole was on campus. There
was a private question and an
swer session, followed by a din
ner and ending the evening
with a public speech. I at
tended all of the functions held
for Senator Dole. Dole was a
charismatic speaker. In his
talks he emphasized taking re
sponsibility for one's actions,
trust, honesty, and morals. He
was very careful not to attack
Clinton.
Several questions were
directed to him regarding the
Lewinsky scandal and
Clinton's progress in office.
Senator Dole responded to
these questions with humorous
remarks however, and he did
not directly criticize the
President's efforts.

Dole frequently made
references to President
Eisenhower. He labeled him
his hero. He made it clear to
the students that Eisenhower
was an outstanding president
because he kept his word and
took full responsibility for his
actions. As Dole noted, this is
very hard to come by today
Today, everyone tries to find
somebody else to blame when

something goes wrong. Presi
dent Eisenhower was a man
who stuck to his word, that is
why Dole admires him.
Eisenhower was also a very
trustworthy individual.
In his references to Presi
dent Eisenhower, Dole was
smart. Eisenhower has many
ties not only to the Gettysburg
community, but also to the col
lege. Dole spoke of a time
when he was a congressional
freshman and President
Eisenhower gave his class, both
democrats and republicans

alike, a tour of Gettysburg.
Senator Dole was also a recipi
ent of the Eisenhower Leader
ship Prize.
I heard many comments
from students that if Dole had
spoken the way he did Monday
night, he would have won the
presidential election. He was
very straight forward in his
speech, while adding jokes here
and there. He was relaxed, yet
very enthusiastic about the gov
ernment and the United States.
Dole spoke very highly about
the people of America and our
system of government.

Senator Dole is a true pa
triot and takes great pride in
our country. In my opinion, he
would have been an outstand
ing president. My first vote was

cast for Bob Dole, and I have
no regrets about it. He is a war
hero, a public servant, and an
honest man. His credentials for
the job were nothing short of
acceptable.
Currently, Dole is work
ing for a law firm. He is also
in charge of fundraising for a
World War Two Memorial in
Washington D.C. I admire Dole
because his failed bid for Presi
dent has not affected his cha
risma. He did not dwell on his
loss, but did note that the voter

turnout for the election was
very low. He spoke to students
about the importance of voting
and being involved. After all,
we are the next generation and
we must strive to continue
making positive progress in the
United States. The right to vote
is a privilege and it is something
that many U.S. citizens take for
granted. It is time for every
one, especially our generation
to become involved. Our in
volvement can prevent weak
leaders and promote a stronger
government.

Senator Dole did a phe
nomenal job speaking Monday
evening. For those of you who
were unable to attend, you not
only missed an excellent
speech, but you missed a man
speaking from his heart.

CONFLICT & Consensus
Work with positive means to gain your end

by Jay Spiese
Columnist In two weeks we will be
holding Get Acquainted Day.
All the prospective first year
students will be coming onto
campus to see if this really is
where they want to go to col
lege. This is our chance to
make one final sales pitch to
them. As a college we have
many problems that need to be
dealt with. No one can claim
that we are a perfect institution.
Last year some students felt
they had been wronged by an

administrative decision.
Get Acquainted Day last
year was hurt because members
of Phi Delta Theta hung ban
ners from their house windows
telling these high school seniors
to go elsewhere. This is not a
proper way to change the prob
lems on campus. There are
certain channels for us to at
tempt to change policy.
First, you must call atten
tion to the problem. You must
make people understand your
position clearly. Gather them
together as a base of support.
You do this through the radio
as the Communist party has
done. You can write an article

for the newspaper as I do. Use
the emails to spread the word
as was done by a rape victim
last year.
Secondly, work with the
administration, not against
them. They are not the enemy
You can oppose decisions they
make and still work with them
to find an acceptable solution.
All of us want the same thing:
a better college. We must work
together to build it.
The proposal of a fine
arts center is a great example
of this. Students and faculty
in the music and theater de
partments are working with the
administration to construct a

new performing arts building.
Through announcements at all
productions and encouraging
petitions, they have gotten
good initial success.
The third thing to keep in
mind is to always be willing to
compromise. Holding firm to
every goal, regardless of con
sequences will make you seem
valiant and romantic, but lost
causes and last stands often are.
Success comes through com
promise.
Shelby Foote one said that
as Americans, our true genius
is for compromise. It is not a
betrayal of your ideals if you
can gain some success even

when you can not win the
whole thing. Remember noth
ing happens over night. The
way must be paved with these
small successes first.
Only as last resort should
you even consider sinking
down to that kind of public dis
play. You do nothing to aid
your cause and worse still, you
reinforce your opposition's re
solve not to bargain with you.
I do not know of anything that
happened this year that would
cause another such display this
year. Still I wanted to give this
advice to anyone with a griev
ance who was planning some
thing like that.


CONFLICT & Consensus

Our reputation is our responsibility

To the. Editor:

tification (two forms) as a non- ing stupid things. Act like you

I would hereby like to
express my thoughts in re
sponse to the front page ar
ticle last week featured in The
Gettysburgian. The article
described the recent forma
tion of a group called the
Hazel Alley Association. This
association is apparently up
set with college students who
are both loud and often ob
noxious, not to mention dirty
and disrespectful individuals.
While some of the
Association's prejudices may
be unfounded, most are prob
ably at least half true. How
ever, I don't think they really
need an association to deal
with the 'problem' of college
students.
The following is ad
dressed to my fellow college
students:

Have you ever tried to
get a job in Gettysburg? If so,
and you write on the appli
cation that you are a Gettys
burg College student, the
chances are you will be
turned down on the spot od
never will be asked to give an
interview.
Have you ever tried to
rent a movie in Gettysburg?
If so, you better not tell the
clerk that you are a Gettys
burg College student. De
spite the fact that you may be
living here for several years,
you can't get it because of
your status as a student.
Have you ever tried to
walk across the town square?
If so, you better think twice.
Borough police can smell col
lege students a mile away. I
have a couple of friends who
have been harassed by more
than one officer while simply
walking across the grass on
the circle.

Have you ever tried to
get a drink at a local tavern?
If so, don't let them know
that you are a college student.
Otherwise you will have to
produce twice as much iden-

student.
So what does all this
mean? Hey! Wake up kids!
The people already don't like
us. How come, you ask. Quite
simple. Here are the explana
tions I have gotten. In the
workplace we don't show up
on weekends. At the video
store we don't return videos for
weeks at a time. At the library
they stop issuing cards to stu
dents so that they can "cut their
losses" on stolen books and
materials. On the square it is
illegal to walk, I guess (no one,
ever gave me a good explana
tion for that one). At the tav
ern, underage college kids try
to sneak in to have a beer.
They don't need an orga
nization to oppose us. The
movement is already underway.
The power to stop it lies in your
future actions from this point
forward. What will you do to
rectify the situation?

I don't think anyone in
the great town of Gettysburg
needs a lecture on discrimina
tion and prejudice. It is wrong,
or so the last 2000 years have
taught us, to stereotype people
based on their age, sex, race,
creed, or nationality—and if 1
may add, status as a student.
The fact that a college profes
sor, an educated person one
would assume, has joined this
association is absolutely abhor
rent, but people do make mis
takes from time to time.

All that aside, there is
without a doubt some grounds
to the local residents' com
plaints. The things which they
often complain about are per
tinent to a small minority of the
college population. These
same things are also true for a
percentage of the Adams
County population. As college
students and as citizens within
this community—which is
what you must view yourselves
as—we do have certain rights
and responsibilities. Quit do-

are responsible individuals,
even if you are not. Make a
game of it. Try to act like you
have some common sense and
you will get respect back from
the townspeople. Money isn't
everything, and the town can
survive without ours, so quit
spitting on them every chance
you get and things just MIGHT
get better, for all of us.
Oh yeah, I am a college
student and a resident of Get
tysburg. Which ignorant ste
reotype would you like to ap
ply to me? The lines aren't al
ways so clear. Let us stop build
ing this wall.

When a band works entirely on its. own outside the parameters
of current trends, and on a shoestring budget, any
accomplishment is seen as a major one. But, every once in a
while, a band comes along that surpasses every expectation,
one-ups every industry naysayer and manages to excel on
their own terms. That hand is OUSTER.

Bullets narrowly upset Swarthmore, Green Terror

Baseball boys
droppin' bombs

by Chris Rippey
Staff Reporter The fact that this past Sat
urday fell upon Easter weekend
did not stop a large crowd of
fans from turning out for the
women's lacrosse game.
Swarthmore traveled to the
Bullet's home field for a battle
in what proved to " be a close
contest.
Despite being down by
four goals at one point, the
Lady Bullets answered back by
winning by a narrow margin
with a score of 12-11. This vic
tory improved the Lady Bullets'
conference record to 5-2.
Seniors Tory Lodge and
Kristin Sullivan provided su
perb transition from defense to
offense with their many inter
ceptions and turnovers allow
ing Gettyburg's offense the
feeds they needed.

Sophomore Kim
Fernandez ripped the winning
goal with 5:35 remaining

Bill Beining looks to take a big hack at an offering by an
opposina pitcher.

breaking the 11-11 tie. The
undisputed player of the game
was sophomore Amy
Stambaugh, who racked up 5
goals and 2 assists, all of which
took place in the second half.
This stellar performance not
only contributed to the Bullet's
victory over Swarthmore, but
also landed her a name in this
week's Centennial Conference
Honor Roll.
Tuesday, the women
hosted Western Maryland in
what proved to be another

close competition. Despite
goalie Michele Centrella's fine
goal keeping and Chrissy
Nordhoff's five goals, the Bul
lets fell, 13-12, to the Green
Terror.
Performing consistently
well in every game this season,
Shanley Cooke did a fine job
at keeping her woman out of
plays, but the offense did not
penetrate as well as they
needed to gain a victory. On
the loss to Western Maryland,
co-captain Kristin Sullivan

Amy Stambaugh jumps past her defenders and adds tremendous speed to the Bullet attack

commented, "We had a late
start in the beginning, but we
pulled together at the end of
the first half. Our transition to
attack ran pretty smooth after

by Ronnie Beeman
Staff Reporter The Gettysburg Bullets
have started the week off on a
good note. Tuesday the Bullets
defeated conference foe West
ern Maryland 8-5. Chris
Lunardi paced the Bullets by
going four for four on the day
Lunardi's three-run
homerun in the third extended
the Bullets' lead to 7-2. The
five run lead was enough for
winning pitcher Drew _Chiesa
(2-2), who scattered 13 hits and
struck out seven batters over
nine innings.
Other oustanding offen
sive performances were turned
in by Drew Lavenburg and
Brett Thorp who each had
three hits in the contest.

the get-go."
Today the women look to

The Bullets have showed
their power over the last week
and a half. The homerun barage
started against Dickinson on
April third. A blast by John
Woods put the final touch on a
13-8 win over the Red Devils.
The next day Darryl Clancy led
off the game with a homerun
against Haverford. Bill Beining
followed this homerun with
another in the fourth but it was
not enough to overtake the
Fords who defeated the Bullets
8-4. The Bullets showed the
flexibilty and strength of their
line-up as their ninth hitter,
Drew Lavenburg, also drilled a
ball over the fence.
In the second match up,
Bill Beining drilled two more
homeruns to lead the rout of
Haverford 10-1, while fresh-

man Drew Chiesa picked up his
first win of the season. The
homerun onslaught continued
as the Bullets traveled to Johns
Hopkins. Chris Lunardi and
Darryl Clancy each hit a
homerun in the 8-6 loss to the
Blue Jays.
In JV action, the Get
tysburg Bullets had an impres
sive showing against
Dickinson. Matt DeVecchi,
Pete Rittenhouse, and Ryan
Sweeny held the Red Devils to
two runs on five hits. Bill
Beining's RBI triple proved to
be the winning run scored by
Dan Sirpenski. Other hitting
stars were Pat Currier, Kit
Wannen, and Biagio Indindoli.
The error free defence was lead
by Tom Boob, Jim Nastasi, and
Jake Heisler.





First conference loss prepares women's tennis for F & M
Brian Cutter of the men's tennis team remains undefeated in number one singles

by Bev-Freda Jackson
Staff Reporter The Lady Bullets suffered
their first conference loss of the
season last week, falling to
Swarthmore 6-3. The compe
tition was tough, but wins were
posted at #2 singles by Tara
Schmitt, #6 singles by Kay
CoFrancesco and the #3
doubles team of Bev-Freda
Jackson and Kate Goodall.
This past weekend the
Lady Bullets traveled to
Haverford to take on the Fords.
Past matches with Haverford
have initiated quite a rivalry
between these two conference
teams. Coming off the loss to
Swarthmore, Gettysburg was
ready for a victory and defeated
Haverford 5-4.

The Haverford match
turned out to be a reunion of
sorts with Mary Joy Troxel '97
and Cythia Hoenes '97 coming
out to support their old team
mates.
The women's tennis team
is wrapping up the season with
a full schedule. On the sched
ule for this week are Western
Maryland, Franklin and
Marshall, and Ursinus. The
Bullets took on Goucher Col¬

lege this past Monday April 13. Glatfelter at #6. Singles action

There was no
prior knowl
edge as to the
level of compe
tition of this
team, but the
Bullets took
command.
Schmitt and
Yoshida at #1
doubles, Bauer
and Glatfelter
at #2 doubles
and Goodall
and Jackson at
#3 doubles
made handy
work of their
opponents,
sweeping the
doubles and the
match 8-1.

Singles
play was with
out Masako
Yoshida due to
a back injury,
and the line-up
was as follows:

last home

Fest, come on out and support
the Lady Bullets and their se
nior captains Tara Schmitt and
Kate Goodall in the last home
match of their tennis careers.
The men's tennis team
had only one match last week,
but the competition was strong.
They traveled to Johns
Hopkins and were defeated
with the only win coming from
#1 singles player Brandon Cut
ter. The men's team is also
wrapping up their match sched
ule for this spring and look to
finish up the season with a
strong conference standing.
Yesterday, the team breezed
through a match with Western
Maryland and are looking for
ward to their competition at
Ursinus on Saturday.

Other Notes: The men's
team conference record stands
at 4-2 while their overall record
has climbed to 7-3. Brandon
Cutter remains unbeaten in #1
singles for Gettysburg, while
the doubles team of Cutter and
newcomer Weston Wells also
owns an unblemished record.
With good performances in
their remaining matches, the
men's tennis team could finish
up very well in the final con
ference standings.

Bullets flying high, trying to catch Terror

by Bill Davidson
Staff Reporter Splitting doubleheaders
with Ursinus and arch rival
Dickinson, the Women's soft
ball team fell one game behind
Western Maryland for the Cen
tennial Conference lead. Post
ing a record of 17-6 overall and
8-2 in conference play, the
Lady Bullets have found them
selves in the thick of a playoff
race. Angie Hoptak was bril
liant in the opener against the
Red Devils, pitching a 4-hit
shutout en route to her third
straight conference win.
Marybeth Korejko contributed
two RBI, going one-for-one
with a walk, in the 4-0 victory.
In the nightcap,
Dickinson used a four run fifth
inning, sending 10 batters to
the plate, to earn the split. Jen
White and Sara Graveline each
recorded multiple hit games in
the losing effort, while Alyson

Adams and Erin Killeen pro
vided_.stellar defense at the cor
ners. On Saturday, the women
dropped a 10-inning heart
breaker, falling 3-2 to the
Ursinus Bears. A sacrifice fly
in the top of the tenth proved
to end the pitching duel.
Hoptak was credited with the
loss, despite another strong
outing.
Hoptak pitched all 10 in
nings, striking out two, while
only allowing one earned run.
Karyn Miller and Marybeth
Korejko provided an offensive
spark in the losing effort, drill
ing three hits apiece against one
of the conferences best pitch¬

ers. The Lady Bullets re
sponded to this defeat by
pounding the Bears 8-1 in the
second game. Eight of the nine
starters recorded hits in this
balanced offensive onslaught.
Tract Bullock, Erin Killeen, and
Jen White each contributed

Erin Killeen patiently awaits a ball batted by her opponent.

two hits and two RBI.
The consistent bats of Jen
White and Karyn Miller paired
with the strong arm of Angie
Hoptak continue to lead the
team. Hoptak's last week per
formance earned her a spot on
the Centennial Conference's
Weekly Honor Roll.
Angie pushed her Cen
tennial Conference record to 3
1 after pitching 17.3 innings for
a 0.40 ERA with four walks and
four strikeouts. White is lead
ing the Centennial Conference
with a .526 batting average.
Miller is close behind in second
place, hitting .516.

Maryland for a doubleheader,
which could decide the confer
ence championship.

Bullets shoot way to head of conference

by Henry Fawell
Assistant News Editor

While most of the school
spent this past week gearing up
for the holiday respite, the
Men's Lacrosse team used the
warm weather wisely by vent
ing a little on-field frustration
against Western Maryland
College and Washington Col
lege, two teams that ripped the
Bullets in 1997 by a combined
score of 28-14.
While the two confer
ence losses last year may have
been the most disappointing of
the season, this week's 15-9
victory over Western Mary
land, and a 7-3 triumph over
Washington, have catapulted
the Bullets to the brink of the
Centennial Conference crown,
a title they have not claimed
since the 1995 season.

As Western Maryland
rolled into Musselman Sta
dium on Wednesday, last year's
10-5 loss against the Green
Terror weighed heavy on the
minds of those Gettysburg
players who were there. "They

Jamie Bateman (11) makes his move past opposing defenders. ' by Emily

came in unranked at the time.
We didn't give them much

thought and we paid for it,"
said middie Andrew Edgerton,
"Everyone was thinking about
it on Wednesday."
After spotting WMC the
game's first goal, the Bullets'
silenced any effort on behalf of
the Green Terror to duplicate
last year's upset. It would be
another thirteen minutes before
they could find the net again,
and by that time Gettysburg
had a firm grip on the game's
tempo.
While ten different play
ers were able to score for the
Bullets, the most notable offen
sive performance came from
All-Conference defenseman
Brian Abbot who, one week af
ter scoring his first career goal,
racked up two more scores, in
cluding a fancy left-handed shot
coming out of transition.

Ross Garretson led the
Bullets' offense with three goals
and one assist, while Abbot, Lee
Hemming and Jamie Bateman
each scored twice. Mark Pol
lack, Rob Crowe, Doug Sage,
Christian Cronin, Pete
Milhman and Kevin Callahan

rounded out the scoring with
a goal each, Goalie Andrew
Barter spearheaded a solid de
fensive effort as he stopped 15
shots. Chestertown, Md.,
hometown to Washington Col
lege, has also been a source of
discomfort for the Bullets as
well. The Shoreman got a grip
on the Centennial title two
years ago by slamming the
door on Gettysburg, the '94
and '95 champs. Last year's
18-9 thumping of Gettysburg
solidified a second straight

title. On Saturday, though, the
Bullets fed off of an outstand
ing defensive effort and loos
ened, at least temporarily, the
Shoremens' two year strangle
hold on the crown. Goalie An
drew Barter, who was credited
with 16 saves by game's end,
teamed up with Brian Abbot,
Justin Domingos, and Mike
McCrain to hold Washington
College to a humbling three
goal output.
Not only was the defen
siye performance superb, but

it was nearly mistake-free, as
well. Gettysburg was only
called for the three penalties in
the entire contest, then stuffed
the Shoreman man-up team by
allowing only one shot in ex
tra-man situations.
Midfielder Lee Hemming
sparked the Bullets' offense as
he ripped the first of his two
goals past All-American Any
Taibl in the game's opening
minutes. From then on, Gettys
burg refused to slow down as
they piled up a 5-0 lead before
the Shoremen could slip in their
first goal.
Washington managed to
climb back to a 5-3 deficit at
the end of the third quarter, but
goals by Sage and Mark Pollack
in final period helped seal the
upset.

With the victory, Gettys
burg snapped Washington's 17
game conference win streak,
which dated back to the 1995
season. This week's conference
matchups against Dickinson
and Swarthmore are now more
important than ever, as Gettys
burg remains as the last unde
feated team in the conference.

Grossberg pleads
guilty to manslaughter

Spring Fest!

Sweetheart of former student faces imprisonment

by Dan Larkin
News Editor

The Associated Press reported
yesterday that the plea agreement
was reached after Grossberg's attor
neys reviewed a transcript of an in
terview Peterson had with prosecu
tors. Peterson reportedly said that
the baby was blue at delivery and
he thought that it was dead.
Peterson also told authorities
that Grossberg had considered get
ting an abortion in the spring of
1996, but decided against it.
Grossberg's lawyers confirmed that
she did consider the abortion.
Grossberg's attorneys main
tained that she believed she was only
four or five months pregnant at the
time of the delivery. She apparently
had a medical exam in July 1996
that did not reveal that she was preg
nant. The teens have both been liv
ing at home with their families, and
have been electronically monitored.
They were each free on $300,000
bail.

Amy Grossberg, high-school
sweetheart of former Gettysburg
College student Brian Peterson
pleaded guilty to manslaughter yes
terday in the death of their infant

son. The child of the affluent teens
from Wycoff, New Jersey was found
in a hotel trash bin in November
1996. Coroners for the state of Dela
ware claimed that the child was born
alive at full term, and died due to
multiple skull fractures caused by
shaking and blunt trauma.
Grossberg and Peterson, both
19, were charged with first-degree
murder after the child's body was
discovered.
Last month Grossberg's attor
neys asked to be tried separately from
Peterson and asked to introduce new
evidence placing blame for the
newborn's death solely upon the
former Gettysburg student.
According to Grossberg's law
yers, polygraph tests showed that she
never saw the child, and thought that
she had a miscarriage.

Peterson pleaded guilty to man
slaughter in the case in March, and
agreed to testify against Grossberg.
His attorney's claimed that he
believed the child to be stillborn, and
put the child in a trash bag per
Grossberg's orders to "Get rid of it!"
Despite the fact that
Grossberg's attorney, Robert
Tanebaum said in March that
Peterson's plea "[did not] change our
strategy at all," it currently appears
otherwise.

$$0e_$_p enjoy $_m and games during last

Grossberg was set to go to trial
on May 4, and could have faced up
to life in prison if convicted.
She entered the courtroom in
tears and embraced family members
before entering her plea. Like
Peterson last month, she answered
in the affirmative to question if she
understood her actions.
Grossberg's sentencing was set
for July 9, as was Peterson's. A man
slaughter conviction carries a maxi
mum penalty of 10 years.
Deputy Attorney General Paul
Wallace said that the baby's death
"was caused by her chilling indiffer
ence," and felt that imprisonment
would be an "appropriate" sentence
for the teens.

Review celebrates 10th anniversary

Gettysburg
chapter of OBK
turns 75

by Laura Root
Staff Reporter From the beginning, the
founders of The Gettysburg Re
view worked for greatness.
Its first issue was published
January 15, 1988. It had every
thing that the staff wanted—
strong writing, professional pub
lication design, and impressive
artwork.
"We wanted to make what
a literary magazine should be,"
said Peter Stitt, editor of the Re
view. "We wanted to start out
with something really good that
we could base the rest of our
magazines on. No poor publica
tions, not even the first time."
This strong work ethic has
helped to produce one of the fin
est literary magazines in the na¬

tion. The goal of the magazine is
simple. "We want to publish the
best writing in America," said
Stitt. According to its readers and

critics, it has.
The Review has been
home to the works of Ritd
Dove, Donald Hall, Garrison
Keeler, Joyce Carol Oates,
John Barrymore, Elizabeth
Bishop, Robert Bly, E.L.
Doctorow, and Robert Frost.
Three Gettysburg Re
views are published each
year by a staff of four pro
fessionals and three students.
The workers sort
through many submissions
to decide which ones will fit
into the magazine's frame
work best. It usually takes
three months to put an en
tire Review together.
The staff works on sev
eral Reviews simultaneously,
however, so this is only a
rough estimate. Some works
are even ready for next
year's publication.
Poetry, fiction, and
non-fiction can be found
within the magazine. It con¬

tains the work of about 24 au
thors. The Gettysbmg Review
adds to both the literary com
munity and the Gettysburg
College community. It brings
prestige to the Gettysburg Col
lege image and provides the
students with a lively source of
intellectual and artistic mate
rial. To celebrate its tenth an
niversary, The Gettysburg Re
view invited two prominent
writers to come and read at the
College. Last week, former
Poet Laureate and Pulizer Prize
winner Rita Dove read selected
poems.
This fall, Donald Hall
will visit the Gettysburg cam
pus. He is New Hampshire's
Poet Laureate and the winner
of many awards, including the
National Book Critics Circle
Award, a Caldecott Medal, and

from staff reports
The Gettysburg College
chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, Iota
chapter of Pennsylvania, is cel
ebrating its 75th anniversary
this year. Founded in 1776 at
The College of William &
Mary, Phi Beta Kappa is the
oldest honorary society in the
United States. It exists prima
rily to give public recognition
to excellence in undergraduate
liberal arts studies, to promote
liberal learning, and to support
and encourage scholars in their
activities,
The Gettysburg College
chapter was founded on Janu
ary 11,1923.
On Thursday, 45 mem
bers of the class of 1998 will
be inducted into Phi Beta
Kappa, two others were in
ducted in the fall, the initiation
ceremony will be followed by

the Los Angeles Times Book
Prize in Poetry.
Both poets are members
of the Advisory Board of The
Gettysburg Review and are con
tributing editors.
Dove was one of the
original members of the Advi
sory Board. Last week's visit
to campus was not her first.
Ten years ago, all nine of
the Review's editors visited
Gettysburg. Hall has been here
twice. Before Dove read from
her works, she gave a few
words on The Gettysburg Re
view. "It is one of the few
magazines that I look forward
to getting in the mail," she says,
"I can always count on the
good quality."

This year, The _Gettysburg
Review is not only celebratinj
ten years of being, but ten year
of being great.

a special dinner and program
celebration. Anne Fradiman,
the new editor of The Ameri
can Scholar will be the keynote
speaker. The title of her address
is "Procrustes and the Culture
wars". Dr. James Lusardi,
Francis A. march Professor of
English at Lafayette College
and Phi Beta Kappa Senator
will bring greetings from the
phi Beta Kappa society. More
than a dozen Gettysburg Col
lege alumni who were inducted
into Iota chapter more than
fifty years ago will be recog
nized.

Seniors raise $18,300 for scholarship fund

from Staff Reports
The Class of 1998 has
currently raised over $18,300
towards the Senior Scholarship
Prize Fund. The Scholarship,
established by the class of
1996, provides two scholar
ships annually to rising seniors.
The scholarships, presented
during Commencement cer
emonies in May, are awarded
to the man and woman in the
rising senior class who best ex
emplify a Gettysburg College
education. Candidates for the
scholarship must have a mini
mum 3.3 GPA and be involved
in various activities and honor
societies.

The members of the Senior Scholarship Committee with Dr.
Haaland.

The first Senior Schol
arship Prize was awarded last
year to current seniors Dan
Crowell and Lindsey Musser.
Funds for the gift are
raised by the Senior Scholar
ship Committee, which is cur
rently made up of twenty-seven
members, and is co-chaired by
Sara Glatfelter, Rebecca Card,
Brian Rusignuolo, and Mat
thew Eisenberg.
The goal set by the Com
mittee this year was to raise
$19,980 from 50% of the Class
of 1998 by April 24.
Currently the Com
mittee has gotten 44% of the
class to participate, and earned
an unprecedented amount of

Senior Scholarship co-chairs with President Haaland
(from left, Sara Glatfelter, Becky Card, Brian Rusignuolo
and Matt Eisenberg.)

money for the fund. Assistant
Director of Annual Giving
Kristen Anderson attributes the
success of the Committee to the
co-chairs. "They've done an
incredible job and worked re
ally hard," she said.
Though the Senior
Scholarship Prize is a relatively
new program, it is part of a
longstanding tradition at the
College. It grew out of what
was previously the Senior Class
Gift to the College.
Members of the Senior

Class who make a pledge of
$100 or more by June 30,1998
will become members of the
1998 Cupola Society Associates
program.
The Cupola Associates
program allows ' younger
alumni of Gettysburg to play a
key role in the future of the
College that was previously
available only to older alumni.
Students who make a
pledge to the fund now are not
required to pay right away. No
money has to be paid until one
year following graduation.

vey was impressive...and di
verse. Many people returned
the survey, and it was quickly
discovered that there are lots
of opinionated people here.
And they feel very passionately
about many things.
The problem of "Favor¬

ite Professor" is a good ex
ample of this. Many profes
sors were named as favorite,
but because of this, no one pro
fessor stood out as a clear fa
vorite. We'll just say that many
professors are well loved.
Other random thoughts
on the survey: Wal-Mart falls

under a good number of catego
ries, including late-night hang
out and favorite date location.
The Gingerbread Man got
votes for both upscale and
cheap restaurant.
Originally, 1 thought that
a date on the battlefields was a
very original and romantic idea.

Then I saw how many people
did it. There are an awful lot of
nicknames for 7-11.
Many people gave very
detailed answers to the ques
tions. Or simply mocked me
for asking.
People gave very specific

locations for favorite place to
study. Like, down to the ac
tual chair in the library.
Don't agree with the fa
vorites listed above? Many
people didn't. Maybe The Best
of Gettysburg 2 (date un
known) will better reflect your
opinion.

swinger, and one of the most
popular men of his day.
When his arch nemesis
cryogenically freezes himself in
order to return in a time where
free love no longer reigned,
Austin volunteers to have mm
himself frozen as well. H
When Dr. Evil makes his H
return in the year 1997, the H
Ministry of Defense H
reawakens Austin to put a H
stop to Dr. Evil's fiendish 9
plans. H
After Austin is H
thawed, he must be accli- H
matized to the 1990's. Spe- H
cial Agent Vanessa H
Kensington (Elizabeth H
Hurley) has been assigned H
to help him get adjusted. H
Vanessa is following in the
footsteps of her groovy mother,
Austin's partner in the 60's.
Austin and Vanessa travel from
London to Las Vegas, where
Dr. Evil's underground lair is
purported to be.

Dr. Evil has returned
from his frozen cocoon in a Big
Boy statue floating in outer
space to find that the cover for
his evil enterprise is flourishing.
His henchman, Number Two

(Robert Wagner), has things
well in hand. Virtucon is a
company which makes over
nine billion dollars a year in the
communications industry. Af
ter being frozen for thirty years,

Dr. Evil must be brought up to
speed by his notorious assas
sins. Austin Powers and Dr.
Evil are both travelers from
another time. They bring with
them a different set of values
and each has a difficult time
adjusting to the changes of the
last three decades. Austin is
ready to have a shagadelic time,
just like they did in the sixties.

However, he doesn't re
alize just what has been going
on for the past thirty years. He
has missed the end of the Cold
War, man's first walk on the
moon, and the deaths of his

friends Mamma Cass, Jerry
Garcia, Jimmy Hendrix, and
Janis Joplin.
Dr. Evil is surprised to
learn that there is a hole in the
ozone layer that will contrib
ute to skin cancer, and that
there has been a divorce in the
Royal Family. Each man has a
very difficult time getting ad
justed, but that is what makes
this movie so funny.

Dr. Evil is holding the
world hostage with a hijacked
nuclear missile, and it is Austin
and Vanessa's mission to save
the world from annihilation. In
typical spy film fashion, they
mm are captured and an elabo
H rate death is planned for
H them. Austin Powers is an
H excellent spoof, making
H many references to James
H Bond films.
H Myers is at his best
H when he plays opposite
H himself. In addition to
H playing Austin Powers,
H Myers also plays Dr. Evil.
H In So I Married An
H Axe Murderer, Myers also
_^_J plays a dual role. Myers is
_^P a master of characters, and
movies like Austin Powers
are an excellent showcase of his
talent.

Austin Powers is a lot of
fun to watch, and would be a
great tension breaker during
exams. And if you see this
movie, you'll understand all of
the Austin Powers-speak at the
Bullet Hole and just what your
friends are saying when they
start discussing Fembots. Yeah,
baby, yeah!



Reel Hits & Misses Object of our contention

by Dan Larkin and Mike Petro
Movie Columnists
Mike: The new movie
starring Friends star Jennifer
Aniston is a romantic comedy
known simply as The Object of
My Affection . Aniston plays
Nina, a youth counselor living
in Brooklyn, who meets
George, a gay school teacher,
at a party.
They exchange stories
and George, played by Paul
Rudd (Halloween: The Return
of Michael Myers, Clueless)
ends up moving in with Nina.
Dan: This spring I've seen
more movies staring cast mem
bers of Friends than I ever
thought I would. And remark
ably, I've been pleasantly sur
prised so far. But like all good
things, this pleasant streak has
come to an end with The Ob
ject of My Affection.
Both George and Nina

are people with difficult prob
lems. George has recently bro
ken up with his boyfriend of
four years and Nina is pregnant
by her overbearing boyfriend,
Vince, played in a solid perfor
mance by John Pankow (Ira
from Mad About You).
Needless to say, they be
come fast friends, so much so
that Nina ends up asking
George to help raise her child
when it comes into the world.
The plot moves for
ward reasonably well,
though at times it is a bit /
slow. Aniston and Rudd _^
play off of one another _^H
very well and are believ
able as friends and kindred
spirits.
They are also supported
extremely well by a strong sup
porting cast.

To say that the plot of this
movie is "a bit slow" is quite
the understatement. It drags

and drags and drags. I guess the
intention is to build up sympa
thy for George and Nina, but it
just made me sick of them.
All I could think of was
that Nina had a heckuva nice
apartment _^_±jor a su ppos-

«_K_^=

^^_v m e n -
tioned before,
Pankow gives a
strong screen performance,
adding a certain brutish charm
to scenes he's in. Also turning
in strong performances are

Alan Alda, who plays Nina's
brother-in-law, and Nigel
Hawthorne, who plays a gay
theater critic.
Hawthorne turns in a
particularly poignant perfor
mance and I was touched by
the perspective his character
brings to the whole story.
/ did like Pankow and
Alda, but I was unimpressed by
leveryone else. Rudd and
I Aniston are boring and unin
spired. I didn't care about
them nearly as much as I
should have for this movie
_^ to succeed.
H I liked this movie.
_^ I liked the fact that
many of the typical Holly
wood stereotypes were
avoided. More than that, I
liked the minor characters in
here, including the very believ
able one-eyed dance teacher at
the community center.
The Object of My Affec¬

tion may avoid some stereo
types, but the neat, patent end
ing is pure Hollywood sap.
What I did like about the
movie was the fact that it didn't
skirt around the issue of homo
sexuality. Even in 1998, show
ing two men kiss is pretty brave.
I thought that this movie
was going to be funny. It
wasn't. I was supposed to care
about the characters. I didn't.
Two stars (out of five).
This is a good movie
about love, friendship, and the
often gray areas that are in be
tween.
I liked Aniston and I
think she has real potential as
a leading actress in romantic
comedies or romantic dramas.
While I think that this
movie was mis-categorized as
a romantic comedy, as a whole
I like it and enthusiastically rec
ommend it. Three and a half
stars out of five.



Warrior Poets play for Irish children Monday

by Barb Dickson
Features Editor
The Warrior Poets, an
Irish music group made up of
sophomores Ian Isherwood and
Jay Spiese and senior Paul
"Hutch" Hutchinson, will per
form for the last time on cam
pus on Monday, April 27, in the
Junction from 8 to 10 p.m.
The group is performing as a
benefit to raise money for the
Irish Children's Fund and will
be joined on stage by friends.
Hutchinson says the
show will be a "good, rowdy,
fun show. It's late in the se
mester and people need a good
time." According to
Hutchinson, the group wanted
to do a big last show, play some
new songs, and make it worth
something. That's where the
idea for making it a benefit con
cert comes in.

The concert itself will be
free, but the group is asking for
a donation of at least one dol
lar. Anyone who donates more
than $10 may also be given a
tape of an earlier Warrior Po
ets concert, recorded in Febru
ary. The availability of the
tapes has yet to be determined.
The Irish Children's Fund
(ICF) is a group that works to
bring groups of both Catholic
and Protestant Irish children
together in the United States.

The students, all eleven to
twelve years old, live together
for six weeks during the sum
mer and get to know children
not of their faith. Hopefully
they will create friendships that
will weather the trip back to
Ireland and create understand
ing in the war-torn country.
The ICF, founded in
1982, is dedicated to salvaging
some of the joys of childhood
for the children of Northern
Ireland, and to building a foun
dation for future peace. Its

goals are to teach tolerance,
understanding, and respect for
the religious, political, and cul
tural beliefs of others, laying
the groundwork for communi
cation.
Among Isherwood's
many hare-brained ideas (after
forming the group, playing in
the Junction, and getting a job
at Buckley's) is the idea to unite
the island of Ireland with the
music of the Warrior Poets,
"like Bill and Ted," says
Hutchinson.

The group was originally
contacted to perform for
Stephanie Sellars' senior thesis
on Irish music in America.
They thought at first about get
ting a large number of campus
bands together to perform, but
decided the idea would be too
difficult to carry out at this busy
time of the semester.

Friends of the group who
will join them on stage during
the performance include Sam
Goodman, who wrote a song
for them, and Sellars, as well
as senior Joie Bucci and other
seniors. "It's sort of a last hur
rah for the seniors," according
to Hutchinson.
The concert will be vid
eotaped, and a copy will be
given to GCTV
The group was formed
last Thanksgiving, and had
their first performance early
this semester. The Warrior Po
ets have performed at the Junc
tion a couple of times, and per
form regularly at the Irish bar
in town, Buckley's. They may
perform at the bar one more
time before graduation. "My
parents still haven't seen me
perform," commented
Hutchinson.

Hutchinson, after gradu
ating in May, will be working
in Gettysburg next year.
Isherwood, however, will be
studying abroad, so the Warrior
Poets will have to disband.
Hutchinson is thinking of
forming another Irish band.
The new band need to think of
a new name though—they
wouldn't be the Warrior Poets.
Even so, "there's still a
future to the band,"
Hutchinson states, and the
band's future is one to watch.

Jones, Rabbai
perform concert

from press release
The Buzz Jones Big Band,
with special guest George
Rabbai, trumpet and scat, for
merly with Woody Herman's
"Thundering Herd" Jazz Or
chestra, will be Celebrating
Gershwin on Tuesday, April
28, at 8 p.m. in the CUB Ball
room. Doors open at 7:30 and
admission is free. Refresh
ments will be provided.
Rabbai's first national
recognition as a trumpeter
came when he joined the
Woody Herman Orchestra,
touring as a jazz soloist. Dur
ing his two year stay, Rabbai
performed at jazz festivals and
concert halls throughout the
United States and abroad, and
recorded with Herman on the
Concord and Toshiba EMI la
bels.

His unique style of scat
singing prompted Herman to
reinstate and rerecord the clas
sic arrangement of the big band
be-bop hit Lemon Drop as a
vocal feature. Lemon Drop is
also the title of Rabbai's own
CD, released in 1997, on DBK
Records.
After touring with the
Herman Orchestra, Rabbai
was selected as part of the
Woody Herman All-Star small
group, performing with artists
like Sal Nistico, J ake Hanna,
Nat Pierce, George Duvivier_,
Scott Hamilton, and Frank
Wess. He has also performed
as a soloist with the Concord
Jazz AllStars.
As a leader, Rabbai has
recorded with jazz greats Hank
Jones, Rufus Reid, and Mel
Lewis for the Naxos label.

Rabbai's lyrical trumpet
sound is featured in the
soundtrack of Baseball , a film
by Ken Burns, which first aired
nationally on PBS in 1994. He
can also be heard in Burns' epic
documentary The West.
Rabbai has been cur
rently working as a soloist be
hind vocalist Rosemary
Clooney, and is featured on her
"Demi-Centennial: A Girl
Singer's Golden Anniversary"
television special for A&E.

He has also recorded
with Margaret Whiting and
was featured with Tony Bennett
on his television special, "Tony
Bennett With Love."
Admired for his tone,
phrasing and swinging style,
Rabbai infuses his perfor
mances with humor and per
sonality. From his exuberant
scat vocals to his warm
flugelhorn and wide array of
assorted mutes, Rabbai's musi
cal colors fill the complete
spectrum of jazz.
His performing engage
ments have included Carnegie
Hall and the famed Rainbow
Room, as well as European jazz
festivals, New York City's St.
Regis Hotel and many East
Coast jazz clubs.

An active jazz performer
and educator, he is currently on
the faculties of Philadelphia's
University of the Arts, The
College of New Jersey in Tren
ton, and Rowan College of
New Jersey in Glassboro. He
makes frequent appearances at
area schools as a jazz clinician,
festival adjudicator, and fea
tured artist.
John Williams "Buzz"
Jones is the Director of Bands
and Associate Professor of
Music at Gettysburg College.
He is responsible for conduct
ing the Symphonic Band, Jazz
Ensemble, Marching Band, and
instrumental chamber en
sembles.
The Buzz Jones' Big Band
was formed in 1979. It was
started simply as a "rehearsal
band," meaning it was basically
a group of people bonded to
gether through the common
thread of music.

The band became popu
lar by word of mouth, and be
gan doing small gigs. At the
peak of their career in the
1980's, they were playing ap
proximately 100 dates a year.
With Jones' teaching career,
however, they had to cut back.
The band now performs be
tween 12 and 15 times a year.
The concert is sponsored
by the Social Initiative Com
mittee and the Jazz Apprecia
tion Society.

The HIV and AIDS epi

"homo
sexual white male disease" be
cause most AIDS and HIV cases
were found among homo
sexual males. Currently this
disease is prominent among
heterosexual females. The
myth that AIDS and HIV is
only contained within the ho
mosexual community is false
and needs to be addressed.
Anyone, any race, any gender,

The only way to protect
yourself is by abstaining from
intercourse or by you and your
partner getting tested. The
more education there is about
AIDS and HIV, the lower the

number of cases there will be.
The top ten states in
number of reported cases are
(in order) New York, Califor
nia, Florida, Texas, New Jersey,
Puerto Rico, Illinois, Pennsyl
vania, Georgia, and Maryland.
The top ten cities are New York
City, Los Angeles, San Fran
cisco, Miami, Washington
D.C., Chicago, Houston, Phila¬

delphia, Newark, and Atlanta.
AIDS is so deadly due to
its ability to mutate rapidly to
counteract the effects of any
drugs used to resist it. Drugs
used in HIV therapy work by
inhibiting specific viral en
zymes essential to the virus'

normal func
tion or replica
tion. It ih es
sential li you
believe that you
are at risk for
AIDS that you
get tested.
Only about
20% of people
at risk are

tested; this is how the disease
spreads.
In the past year, the death
rate has dropped by half not
only due to the new medica
tions, but also because of the
awareness about the disease,
who it affects, and how it can
be prevented. HIV and AIDS
can affect anyone, so don't
think, "That could never hap
pen to me." It could.

Cancer sticks

by Wesley Thurmond and
Andrew Addonizio
Contributing Reporters
Despite the overwhelm
ing statistics, the tobacco in
dustry still claims that there
is no link between smoking
and cancer. In 1990, it was
estimated that over 419,000
people died from diseases di
rectly related to smoking ciga
rettes. This statistic accounts
for one-fifth or all deaths in
the United States.
Not only does smoking
have health problems related
to it, but the economic factor
is astronomical. Over 97 mil
lion dollars are spent each
year to treat smoking related
diseases. This does not in
clude such things as smoking
related fires, birth defects
caused by smoke, or illness
due to second-hand smoke.

It is know that tobacco
smoke contains 4000 chemi
cals, including 200 known
poisons. This fact alone
shows a great link between

cancer and cigarettes. Smoking
can also cause emphysema and
chronic bronchitis.
The best way to reduce
your risk of cancer is to fully
abstain from smoking. It has
been found that non-smokers
live 25 percent longer than those
who do smoke.
Sidestream smoke, which
is blown at bystanders, contains
higher concentrations of some
harmful compounds than the
mainstream smoke inhaled by
the smoker.
To help fight the war on
smoking, Congress has set regu
lations on the tobacco industry.
All states have banned the sale
of cigarettes to anyone under 18,
and have banned the use of
vending machine cigarette sales.
Many states now ban advertis
ing on billboards and public
transportation.

For a healthier lifestyle for
you and others around you, ab
stain from smoking cigarettes.
Quitting smoking will improve
your health and could possibly
save your life.

Greek tragedy at
Gettysburg

From staff reports
On Friday, May 1, Clas
sical Studies 264, Ancient
Tragedy, will be performing
Euripides' The Phoenician
Women as interpreted
through the eyes of directors
Jeremy Knapman, Travis
Kreider, Marty Masar, John
Meier, and Erich Peitzsch.
The play will take place
in front of Penn Hall, on the
Musselman Library side, and
will begin at 3 p.m.
The Ancient Tragedy
class puts on a play each year
on the reading day before fi
nals. Past plays include last
year's Amphitryon.
Oedipus discovers that
he has just married his own
mother and killed his father
and so blinds himself in pun
ishment. He then hands over
the rule of Thebes to his two
sons which causes conflict and
civil war. Some Phoenician

Women who are trapped in
Thebes witness the horrors of
the war.
This play, written in 410
B.C. and considered to be among
Euripides' most famous works in
Plutarch's time, about the con
flict between two brothers at
tempting to gain the heritage of
their father's land, is a great rep
resentation of a typical Greek
tragedy.
Euripides, who began writ
ing plays at the age of 18, wrote
approximately 92 plays, of
which 18 remain. He was the
third of the three great Greek
dramatists, Aeschylus and
Sophocles being the other two.
He was quite popular in his
own time and was the object of
satire by Athenian writers of
comedy, particularly
Aristophanes.

Come out on the reading
day at 3 p.m. and see how Greek
tragedies were performed way
back in ancient Greece.

CONFLICT & Consensus

Everyone Should Study Abroad

enough, I chose to come back

To the Editor:
Disclaimer: Any sarcas
tic, negative comments di
rected at a particular group
on campus is merely a gener
alization that is not meant to
offend any individual.
As a graduating senior,
I spend a lot of time reflect
ing on the past four years. We
are all aware of the debates
that have spilled across the
pages of The Gettysburgian
with the two most volatile is
sues being Greek vs. Indepen
dent and diversity. Before

you stop reading, I assure you
that this is not another poorly
written, squashy stream of
complaints about the institu
tion we all chose to attend. I
assume that all the students
at Gettysburg College are
here out of their own free
will; if not, well, I can't imag
ine anyone being dragged
kicking and screaming by
their parents to a college that
costs $30,000 a year. Finan
cial issues are not my concern
in this letter, but I can con
tinue along the theme of "free
will."

At first glance at all the
Greeks running around doing
juvenile things because a fel
low brother or sister tells
them to, and at the flocks of
sheep that thunder into Servo
every evening, Gettysburg
College does not seem like
the ideal place to grow as an
individual. Yet, adversity of
ten sprouts integrity, just as
suffering allows one to feel
and appreciate happiness to
a greater degree. Take me as
an example of this sociologi¬

cal phenomenon. After one
semester at Gettysburg, I was
ready to transfer. But I'm still
here. Why? Besides the fact
that I never actually applied
to any other schools, I rea
soned that if I go abroad for
one full /ear, three years
won't be so bad. Actually, it's
been pretty darn good. I
would say that the best thing
that Gettysburg has done for
me is provide me with the
opportunity to expand my
education into the world.

Isn't that what we're all here
for, to learn about the world?
Gettysburg is far from being a
microcosm of planet Earth (it's
probably closer to Mars, since
we're so ahen-ated...ha ha);
behold the necessity of study
ing abroad, or spending some
time off-campus in a more di
verse community via a service
learning project, for example.
One does not have to
leave the country in order to
experience "diversity" (for lack
of a better word); go to New
York City, Arizona, or the Sea
Islands and you will discover
that the United States does not
lack culture; too many students
are just too sheltered in their
personal lives to realize or care
that it exists. Yet, the many
colors of America make up only
a fraction of the prism. Every
student should go abroad at

some point during his/her
higher education. I do not
mean a two week European
vacation, American style. I
mean whether it is two weeks
or two years, one must live in
another country. I have heard
students complain that spend
ing a semester away from Get
tysburg would interfere with
his/her major or that it is too
expensive. Getting away from
Gettysburg does not necessar
ily mean physically leaving
Gettysburg during the aca
demic year. There are many
abroad opportunities during
the summer; you can even le
gally work in some countries,
and get a practical as well as
cultural experience. As for the
cost, a semester at Gettysburg
is more expensive than some
study abroad programs. I do
not wish to ramble on like a

study abroad brochure, so for
more information contact
Rebecca Bergen at OffCampus
Studies. The important thing
is to open your mind beyond
Gettysburg, because, as St. Au
gustine said, "The world is a
book, and those who do not
travel, read only a page."
That brings me back to
the idea of free will. I chose to
go abroad, and surprisingly

If I could have completed a
degree in England or France
(where I spent my junior year,
respectively) I probably would
have stayed. But for conve
nience and to please my par
ents, I reluctantly came back to
Gettysburg. I came back ex
pecting everything to be the
same, and weekends to be spent
sighing in my room looking at
photos of my European travels,
reminiscing about wild nights
in pubs and clubs. But, some
thing had changed. Weekend
thoughts went from "what to
do, what to do" to "what can I
do...I can do this, this, or
this..." without even thinking

about leaving campus. I left the
Dive to return to the Junction.
(Of course, I knew about the
renovation before leaving, but
it was quite a shock anyway).
Whether it's the coffeehouse,
a concert, a speaker, a poetry
reading, weekend or weekday
the Junction is never left in
bubbling emptiness (allusion to
the bubbly pillars of the Dive).
Along the lines of improved
social programming are BYOB
events, and talk about building
a bar and maybe even a dance
club on campus. So congratu
lations to SAC and others for
their efforts in making Gettys
burg a better place to party.

In addition to the long
awaited changes that have fi
nally come forth and those that
are in the midst of creation, I
have noticed a slight decrease
in the student apathy for which
Gettysburg College is s known.
There may not be less com
plaining, but there is definitely
a lot more doing. Unfortu
nately, these changes have not
affected everyone. The echo of
"there's nothing to do here" is
still in the air. And though
there are more minority and
international students than my
first year, I still smell a cloud
of intolerance floating around.

Consider this

When it comes to getting
students fired up, the best in
stigator isn't a anti-Greek ar
ticle but the debate over
Macintosh versus PCs.
There are too many con
sequences for Gettysburg to
become a PC-only environ
ment, just as converting to all
Macs is unreasonable.
The College supported
Macintoshes when the Classes
of '98, '99, and '00 arrived.
Ironically, at those times, one
of the College's selling points
was that it had equal numbers
of Mac and PC labs, yet the
current proposal threatens to
exclude the computers that the
College endorsed for students
prior to their enrollment.
Denying support to Mac
users is not only unfair but
unjustified. The resources to
maintain those machines on
campus are minimal. This
move will not reduce the num
ber of computers on campus
but simply shift the balance to
PC, a type of machine not
without its own faults.
The Mac phaseout would
alienate too many incoming
students that would want to
bring their Macs from home.
Such drastic measures would
also cause students who own

Macintoshes to feel obligated to
purchase a PC system-another
expense to discourage would
be students.
While Mac-bashing is
trendy, the facts are that new
Macs have faster processors
than the Pentium II, are easier
to use and network (although
PCs are quickly learning that
Apple is on target and has be
gun to follow the Mac lead),
and are better for graphic arts
and publishing applications.
While the cost of updat
ing the Mac labs with new ma
chines has been argued, a col
lege that wants to upgrade its
academic standing should not
fear expense when it comes to
purchasing cutting-edge tech
nology to bolster the education
of its students.
Macs and Mac clones are
still used in the "real world"
that college prepares us for.
The real world uses a lot of dif
ferent kinds of computers, and
learning any one of them
should be ample preparation
for working in the Information
Age. The question should not
be Mac versus PC but rather a
matter of allowing students to
use the operating system of
their choice.

Republican changes now can mean big gains in 2000

by John Dunlap
Political Columnist
This week Republican
congressional leaders dumped
the entire United States tax
code into Boston Harbor as a
way to show their desire to
change the burdensome and
overly large federal tax sys
tem. Once again, the GOP
hopes to stand with our revo
lutionary forbears. However,
over three years after a Re
publican Revolution was pro
nounced, Republicans seem to
have lost their revolutionary
zeal. In 1995, Republicans
entered Congress in the ma
jority for the first time in forty
years. Seventy-three fresh
man Republicans in the
House o'f Representatives
were setting the tone and had

a Contract on America to work
from. They wanted a balanced
budget, tax cuts, regulatory re
form and tort reform. Today we
have a balanced budget, we have
received some tax cuts (but not
nearly enough), and no regula
tory or tort reforms. This is not
the complete fault of Republi
cans. The first one hundred days
of the Republican majority were
remarkable. They kept all of
their promises and had pre
empted the President. Bill
Clinton was forced into arguing
that he was still relevant. Within
a year, the White House spin
took over, along with a media
onslaught against House Speaker
Newt Gingrich of Georgia. On
the issue of the budget, the presi
dent demonized Republicans,
and things only got worse in the
1996 presidential campaign.
The 1996 Republican

nominee for the presidency,
former Senate Majority Leader
Robert Dole, seemed out of
touch with the conservative
movement and ran a poor cam
paign. In congressional races,
Republicans kept with the mes
sage and held on to Capital
Hill. 1997 would bring a still
divided Washington, but now
Republicans seemed afraid of
the president. The budget was
balanced, but no major reduc
tions in the size of government
were made and taxes are still
too high. Republicans talked
up tax reform but have only
held hearings, and GOP lead
ers are still divided. Speaker
Gingrich has survived one coup
attempt, and Majority Leader
Dick Armey has come under
assault by Republican sopho
mores in the House.

Just recently the days of
the old Democratic pork-bar
rel politics came back to the
House and Senate as a pork
barrel transportation bill was
passed. Its main author was the
Republican version of the
Democratic Senator, and pork
barrel king, Robert Byrd, Bud
Shuster of Pennsylvania.
Gettysburg's own history pro
fessor Norman Forness said it
correctly in his Urbanism in
American History course when
he stated, "Republicans know
how to spend when they want
to." The GOP is great at talk
ing tax cuts and reduction, but
Washington has trapped them.
Do not get me wrong,
things are much better than
they were four years ago when
we had an off and on liberal
Democratic president and
Democratic Congress. In

1994, the talk in Washington
was of tax increases, national
ized health-care and increased
government spending. Repub
licans have given us welfare
reform, the line-item veto and
health-care reform that Presi
dent Clinton could not deliver.
Republicans can get back
on track by maintaining the
Congress this year and electing
a President in 2000 who favors
basic reforms such as tax re
form. I do believe that repub
licans should just not wait the
Clinton presidency out. They
should be pushing for com
mon-sense reforms and debat
ing the president on the key is
sues of the day, not just watch
ing for the next presidential
scandal.
We have the majority for
the first time in forty years.
Let's do something with it.



CONFLICT & Consensus
Bothered "brother" bashes 'burgian

To the Editor:
In search of some
amusement, I decided to read
The Gettysburgian. As usual,
I was provided with hours of
laughs from this poorly writ
ten, researched, and pre
sented excuse for a paper.
Specifically, I chose to make
this overreaching generaliza
tion to stoop to the level of
your authors. Many instances
in your paper have been por
trayed in highly biased and
stereotypical fashion.
Instead of focusing on
this endless list of previous
mistakes, I would like an ex
planation from the nameless
author in the "Consider
this..." section of the paper to
defend his or her statement-

that "brothers were allowed to
continue their repulsive lifestyles
off campus." This statement is a
horrendous accusation. Assum
ing that you are somewhat edu
cated here at Gettysburg, igno
rance cannot be your excuse.
All-inclusive statements are
wrong both morally and ethi
cally when referring to a group
of people. Also, being a fellow
"brother," I'm extremely in
sulted that you have described
my lifestyle as "repulsive." Please
step off you pedestal and stop
judging others.
Also, I would like to com
ment to the people of the "Ha
zel Alley Association." Your
town is a fine town, but most of
the time your "townie" mental¬

ity is part of the problem. I
would like to know the answer
to a few trivial questions: Why
do the Gettysburg police wait
in the Ice House overflow lot
to give tickets to college stu
dents? Why are all the meters
in town free during the Christ
mas season while the college
meters are still ticketed? How
is Crack Alley coming? Are
there still bar fights once a
week at Hamilton's? Why am
I harassed and annoyed by loi
tering high school children at
7-11? Also my most important
one, Why do some of the land
lords charge -astronomical
amounts of rent to college stu
dents? The town is selling their

soul to rent their properties and
they still have the audacity to
complain when college kids do
not treat them with respect.
Basically, I would like to say
that some of the landlords here
are thieves. As college students
we are very limited in the prop
erties that we can rent. Have
some integrity and break up
your monopoly of rental prop
erties and earn the respect of
the students. I can site numer
ous examples of houses that
four to six college students pay
more than $3,600 per person
to rent a house for one year that
often does not include utilities.
Also, these rentals are often
safety hazards and show land
lords' ability to count money,

but not to spend it. I just don't
understand how the rentals in
Gettysburg can be priced like
they're on Park Avenue. Actu
ally, I think I know why—Be
cause we have no choice if we
don't want to live on campus.
Wake up Gettysburg and stop
playing this elitist game. You
complain about empty kegs and
I'll complain about
Gettysburg's homeless, va
grants, crack, and thieving mo
nopolistic landlords. Don't
you people have something
more worthwhile to attend to?
I know I do.
Sincerely,
Michael J. Holm '99

Musical Tribute to Professor DeClair

To the Editor

Tragedy

To the Editor:
I bemoan the musical
tragedy that occurred in the
CUB on Saturday, April 18.
Ziggy Marley and the Melody
Makers were wonderful as
usual (I think), but our ears
were deprived of the experi
ence. Why? Because the deep
bass was cranked so loud that
it distorted and covered the rest
of the sound spectrum. This
made it virtually impossible to
hear the lyrics, or to appreci
ate the subtlety of the instru
mental mix. I felt as if I were

being buffeted by the wind, and
it rattled my entire body.
I complained to three dif
ferent people by the sound
board, none of whom seemed
neither to have any authority
nor care to pass the word to
anybody who did. When I
spoke to the man in charge as
he walked by me, he wouldn't
and/or couldn't hear me. Ev
eryone else I talked to agreed
with me that it was too loud,
including both students and old
fogies like me.
Ziggy's brand of reggae is

joyful, spiritual, and (often)
lyrically significant. It doesn't
need to be blasted and distorted
to make an impact. And it
wasn't when I heard them at
Yale 4 1/2 years ago. What a
pity that Gettysburg College
was deprived of a similar ex
perience due to the behavior of
the contracted audio firm that
handled our concert.
After an hour I gave up
and left. Outside the building

I saw people dancing to the
sound of "Raw Riddim" and
rattling windows. At home I
played my three Ziggy Marley
CDs to replace bad vibes with
good. We have heard great con
certs in the CUB before. I'll
never forget Squeeze and Flock
of Seagulls in the early 80s, and
the more recent Violent
Femmes concert. It can hap
pen again if somebody can con
trol the sound contractor.

Sincerely,
Charles F. Emmons,

For the past five years
Professor Edward G. DeClair
has given his knowledge and
foresight in an effort to better
prepare his students for the
adversities they may face in the
real world. His unique style of
teaching, while sometimes con
troversial, offers his students an
educational experience wholly
different from the rather bor
ing and mundane styles so
prevalent on this campus. His
methodology of treating his
students like the adults they
supposedly are and should be,
along with his refusal to mol¬

lycoddle those who have no
desire to learn, often offends
people. Yet for those who wish
to receive an excellent educa
tion, above and beyond the ut
terances of a textbook, he
shines as an educator who
genuinely cares about the well
being of his students. It is our
position that the denial of ten
ure to this excellent professor
was a grave mistake, made by
those who care too much about
catering to the infantile few and
not enough about the values of
a superior education. Yet this
forum is not for rehashing is¬

sues that have long since passed
us by, but instead, formally say
ing goodbye to the man who
gave many of us the greatest
educational experience of our
lives. While many who have
taken a class taught by Profes
sor DeClair may agree with the
statements made in this article,
only those who have taken his
European Union: Policy and
Progress course can appreciate
fully, the professor, the man,
and the paramount importance
of his presence. The culmina
tion of a semester of immense

work and research is the Euro
pean Union Simulation in
Washington D.C. The three
day simulation is not only an
opportunity for students to use
the acquired knowledge in a
practical manner, but stands
alone as the only practical uti
lization of knowledge, incorpo
rating both academics and life
skills. For those who partici
pate, a commitment is made
not only to Professor DeClair,
but to their fellow students as
well. It is a commitment to
learn and work together, not
only through the course of the

semester, but representing Get
tysburg at the simulation,
which involves thirteen other
schools. Each year this simu
lation is dominated by Gettys
burg and this year was no dif
ferent. From December 4-7,
Professor Declair's students
performed at a level that far ex
ceeded their colleagues from
other schools. Their level of
preparation was noticeably bet
ter than the other participating
schools. For its participants,
obvious credit should be given

to Professor DeClair for pre
paring his students in a man
ner that allowed them to rep
resent Gettysburg in a way that
all would be proud. To profes
sor DeClair, who gives so much
of his time to insure the suc
cess of his students, we say
Thank You. You have given us
memories, which we shall
never forget; for that we are
eternally grateful. Wherever
you may go, you will be re
membered not only as a great
professor, but a wonderful man
as well.
Thank you and good
luck!


EU class. Fall 1997

To the Editor:

For almost two years I
have observed the system of
our residential staff. In this
time I have come to the con
clusion that this system is a
mockery of the same ideals that
Gettysburg College so fervently
espouses: unconditional equal
ity and unbiased action. The
first page of the Student Hand
book states that, "It is the
policy of Gettysburg College
not to discriminate improperly
against any matriculated stu
dent, employee or prospective
employee on account of race,
color, religion, ethnic or na
tional origin, age, gender,
sexual orientation, or being dif¬

ferently abled."
However, the college
gives distinct and empowering
abilities to a select few and
leaves the vast majority impo
tent and "differently abled." As
mere matriculating commoners
we are left to the disposal of
the elite R.A. class. This is not
equality. One can respect the
logically-appointed hand of a
college administrator, but he
surely cannot respect the im
pulsive fist of his fellow stu
dent. It is hardly uncommon
for R.A.s to become authoritar
ian or experience delusions of
grandeur. And all too often

there is a grievous abuse of
authority. R.A.s are best
known for their unwarranted
"power-trips" and wanton dis
regard for their fellow students.
Like the Gestapo of old,
R.A.s frequently take pleasure
in the misfortunes of their resi
dents. They notoriously boast
of their citations, trophying the
enormity of the subsequent
fines. Concepts of fraternity
and confidence are surely lost
in this deceitful power struc
ture. R.A.'s need nothing more
than the cross of a "t", to be
seen for what they really are:
RATS.

Abroad

-from
Experiencing other cultures is
the way to dissipate that
cloud...if only every student
was required to experience
other cultures (because some
irrationally choose not to),
whether by going abroad, do
ing a service learning project,
or some other way...but per
haps I am being too hopeful.
All I can do, as one who is de
parting, gladly (because I'm
ready to move on), yet sadly
(because I wish I could be
around a little longer to ap-

page 11
preciate the wonderful
changes that have been hap
pening here and help initiate
more) is encourage those who
remain: go away, but while
you're here, do something.
Gettysburg College is finally
progressing rapidly; it can
only be blinded by the cloud
when people refuse to see the
beauty outside, and reel that
beauty in with persistence and

Matrices, or tables of numbers, are
representations of operators on a
vector space that preserve the
essential operations of vector addition
and scalar multiplication. They have
applications in many important areas
including mechanics, fluid flow,
ecology, probability theory, engineer
ing, and communications. A key to
understanding the behavior of a
matrix is its factorization. In this
talk, we look at a particular factoriza

simple, albeit incomplete, example
from communications. ALL STU

Forget about raising the roof... raise the rim

by Bill Davidson
Staff Reporter
Basketball is a game ot
passing, cutting, and shooting
that requires skill, balance, and
grace. This is still true at the
amateur level, but the National
Basketball Association (NBA) is
another story. Taller, stronger
athletes dominate the game. To
continue popularity, the NBA
needs to adjust its rules to ac
commodate these phenomenal
players.
The evolution of NBA
athletes is evident when com
paring teams of different eras.
The average height of the
1959-60 World Champion
Boston Celtics was 6'4", while
the 1997-98 Los Angeles Lak
ers average a height of 6'8".

During the 1960_'s a leg
endary giant dominated the
NBA. Wilt Chamberlain, a 72"
giant possessing astounding
speed, towered over the com
petition like a redwood in a
scrub forest. His supremacy
peaked in the 1961-62 season
when he averaged an unprec-

¦e de _ited hfty points per game.
To reduce Chamberlain's domi
nance, the NBA intervened,
widening the three-second lane
by four feet, forcing him to play
farther from the basket. The
rule change was needed, and it
worked to a certain extent.
Since the 1960's, the aes
thetics of the game have
changed. Today, there are sev
eral NBA centers with Cham
berlain-like attributes. Patrick
Ewing, Shaquille O'Neal, and
David Robinson all possess ex
ceptional speed and jumping
ability to accompany their tre
mendous height. Guards and
forwards have also followed
this trend. Tall, rangy athletes
_snch as Eddie Jones have cre
ated a new generation of guard
play-

Forwards close to 7' such
as Kevin Garnett possess the
agility of guards. As a result,
these oversized players have
created a claustrophobic game
above the rim. To counter this,
the NBA needs to make a
monumental rule change that
would drastically improve the

game. Raising the basket six
inches would revive passing,
cutting, and shooting, ingredi
ents which used to be essential
in the NBA. All NBA players
would need to utilize funda
mental skills. Dominating cen¬

ters and leaping forwards
would no longer be able to
dunk at will. Instead of dunk
ing, they would need to en
hance their Herculean power
with finesse. Undoubtedly
these players would respond to
this change by developing their
skills, thus restoring the purity
of the game.
The majority of dunks in
a NBA game are no longer en
tertaining. Watching giants

such as Shaquille O'Neal barely
leave the ground before thrust
ing the ball through the hoop
is simply not fun to watch.
Raising the height of the rim
would solve this problem.
Most players would still be able
to dunk, but they would do so
less frequently. Therefore,
dunk shots would once again
be appreciated. And, fans
would respond to the fresh
game above the rim.
The six-inch theory faces
three common arguments.
Most people feel that the his
tory oi the game would be jeop
ardized, making past, present,
and future records incompa
rable. Second, people who
think the height adjustment is
a good idea are still skeptical
because they feel all baskets at
every level of play would need
to change accordingly. Finally,
many critics feel the change
would hamper shooting.

The NBA, like most pro
fessional sport leagues, has
tinkered with subtle rule
changes throughout its history.
In 1979 they added the three
point arc to generate more

scoring and in the process cre
ated a more enjoyable game for
fans. A rim adjustment in high
school or college basketball
would be ludicrous. At these
levels, the game is played in its
purest form, below the rim.
Only in the NBA are seven
footers abundant. Only in the
NBA do 6'10" forwards possess
forty-eight inch vertical leaps.
Only in the NBA does the av
erage guard approach six-and
a-half feet.
Incoming players would
need time to adjust to the dif
ferent rim height, but the tran
sition would not be difficult.
After several weeks of practice,
any player would realize that
it is not a substantially higher
target at which to shoot.

For NBA fans there is
no need to panic. The game
will not be ruined. Kobe
Bryant would still deliver acro
batic dunks; Reggie Miller
would still drain three's, silenc
ing raucous crowds; and
Michael Jordan would still be
the most talented man to ever
play the game.



Bateman shoots his way into the record books

Bullet bats battling barrage
of close games

by Henry Fawell
Assistant News Editor
The Bullets used this past
week wisely by scoring two big
wins and continuing to nail
down their chances for the
Centennial Conference cham
pionship.
Consecutive victories
over Dickinson and Swarth
more, both conference oppo
nents, improved the Bullets'
record to 8-3, 5-0 in the con
ference, and ensured at least a
share of the conference crown.

Last Wednesday, Gettys
burg travelled north to Carlisle
where the Dickinson Red Dev
ils were looking for their first
conference win of the season.
The Bullets severed what hopes
the Devils may have had by
racking up a dominating 27-2
win, where fifteen different
players scored for the Bullets.
Jamie Bateman and Scott
Lowery each tallied five goals
in the win. In the past two sea
sons the Bullets have beaten
Dickinson by a combined score
of 57-4.

On Saturday, the Bullets
put on another exhibition at
Swarthmore's expense for all

those taking a break from
Spring Fest. Jamie Bateman be
came the seventh player in
school history to score at least
100 goals in his career.
Bateman racked up six
goals on the afternoon, includ
ing four and one assist in the
first quarter when Gettysburg
jumped out to an 8-0 lead.
Only the final whistle could
stop the Gettysburg onslaught,
but not before they had in
flicted a 22-3 drubbing on the
visiting Scarlet.
Scott Lowery turned in
another well-balanced perfor
mance against Swarthmore by
scoring four" times and handing
out four assists. On the week,
Lowery scored nine goals on
just eleven shots and registered
six assists. His outstanding play
landed the senior captain on
this week's conference Honor
Roll.

Bateman is presently the
fourth-leading point scorer in
the conference with 34 goals
and 9 assists (43 pts.). Lowery
is seventh with 19 goals and 20
assists (39 pts.), and Ross
Garretson is eighth with 22
goals and 11 assists (33 pts.),
despite battling a leg injury the

Gettysburg face-off man Lee Hemming battles for this free ball

past few weeks. »
Andrew Barter, who fin
ished Saturday's game with
seven saves, is on pace to break
the record for save percentage
for conference games. The
standing record of 71.3 percent
was set in 1995 by former Get-

by Ronnie Beeman
Staff Reporter The Gettysburg Bullets
have won three out of their last
four games. Last Saturday, the
Bullets swamped struggling
Swathmore College and
pounded out two wins in both
ends of a double header.
In the first game, Paul
Koether picked up his 5th win
of the season. Koether only
gave up three hits in his seven
innings of work. John Woods
went three-for-four with an
RBI and Kevin Grimm had two
RBI's to pace the Bullet offen
sive attack.
In the second game,
freshman Jeff Ellis picked up
his second win of the season.
Bill Neston was three-for-four
with and RBI; Drew Lavenburg

tysburg All-Atnencan Jake
Kovalcik '96. Presently, Barter
has stopped an impressive 75.3
percent of his shots faced. The
next best percentage, held by
Franklin &c Marshall's Marc
Pascal, is 62.1 percent.
Gettysburg, which is cur-

was two-for-four with two RBI;
Chris Lunardi and Daryl
Clancy each had two hits
apiece; and Bill Beining put the
finishing touches of with a two
run triple. On Monday, the
Bullet's traveled to Lancaster to
face Franklin & Marshall Col
lege. The Bullets won 10-8
behind the strong pitching per
formance of Drew Chiesa.
Chiesa (3-2) struckout eight in
eight innings of work.
P.J. McElroy worked a
perfect ninth inning to pick up
the save. To top of a streak of
smoking hot play, Lunardi hit
a game winning three-run
homerun to seal the win for the
Bullets in top ot the ninth.
Freshman catcher Kit Wannen
made an immediate impact in
his first varsity start going 3-4
with 2 RBI's.

rently ranked No. 6 in the Di
vision III polls, travels to F &
M this Saturday for their final
conference matchup. A win
against the Diplomats will en
sure the Bullets an outright
Centennial Conference cham
pionship and a berth in the
NCAA Tournament.

Yesterday the Bullet's
lost a heartbreaker to Messiah
College. The Bullets overcame
a four run deficit in the first
inning with three runs in the
first and two runs in second.
The Bullets' held the lead until
the ninth when they gave up
four runs.
Tom Boob pitched well in
the loss, only giving up 1 run
in his time on the mound. John
Woods, Bill Beining and
Lunardi all made significant
contributions to the Bullets's
five runs, but in the end Mes
siah was the winner.
The 16-13 Bullets have
five games left on thier sched
ule, including games versus
conference rivals Franklin 6c
Marshall, and Washington Col
lege. Their other remaining
games are against York College
and Lebanon Valley College.




Men shut down Dips, both teams await conferences

by Bev-Freda Jackson
Staff Reporter The Lady Bullets finished
up the regular season with a
series of matches. Last Wednes
day, the Bullets took on West
ern Maryland, a team who is
in the midst of a formidable

season.
Doubles action fell in the
favor of Western Maryland as
all three doubles teams fell in
tight eight game pro-sets. Al
though it would be a challenge
having to come back from be
hind, the Bullets were still in
the match.
It was imperative that the
Bullets get off to a good start
in singles. The Lady Bullets
rose to the challenge to stage
the comeback, sweping the
singles and the match 6-3.
The biggest match of the
season had the women's tennis
team traveling to Franklin 8c
Marshall for the conference
showdown. Defeat of F & M
would make Gettysburg co
champs for this season.

The match was a com
petitive one, but the Bullet's
fortune fell to F &c M, 6-3
Wins were recorded at #1
doubles by Tara Schmitt and
Masako Yoshida, Yoshida again
at #1 singles and Laura Bauer

at #4 singles. The Lady Bul
lets' second place finish in the
conference is indicative of their
great season.
The last

match of the
regular season,
on home turf,
had Gettysburg
facing Ursinus.
The Bullets fin
ished the season
with a bang. Tara

Despite skid, laxsters learning

from Staff Reports
As of late the young Lady
Bullets lacrosse team has been
running into some tough com
petition. The Bullets have been
playing well, but their oppo
nents have been putting up
some tough competition.
After winning four times
in a span of five games from
March 26 through April 11, the
Bullets (5-7, 5-3 conference)
have suffered consecutive
losses to nationally ranked op
ponents Drew and William
Smith.
Through 11 games, se
nior Chrissy Nordoff is the
Bullets leading scorer with 34
goals and seven assists.
Nordoff leads the team in as
sists with sophmore Amy
Stambaugh, who has had 17
goals to go along with her seven

assists.
Freshman Michelle
Centrella has been the Bullets
starting goalie the whole sea
son and has saved close to 80
shots. Statistics prove these
women have had some tough
games. To date the Bullets have
scored 121 goals, while their
opponents have scored 122.
The Bullets have gotten off 336
shots while their oppoents have
only totalled 284 shots.
The team has registered
36 assists to their opponents'
25, and have also out- hustled
their opponents gaining 298
ground balls to their challeng
ers' 220.
In recent action, the Lady
Bullets took on the Lady Dip
lomats frnm F &" M. Once

again super-senior Kristin
Sullivan (17 goals, 3 assists) is
leading the team with her abil¬

ity and heart, as she endless
romps up and down the field.
The Bullets made a great
effort against the Diplomats
and played with all the inten
sity of a locomotive train, but
came up short in the end, los
ing 17-11.
The team has the talent
and they fight until the final
whistle blows, but the fact re
mains that this particular group
of women has only played to
gether for 12 games.
With mostly an under
classman starting contingent,
this squad, though packed with
talent, may just need one thing:
time. Though this season is
drawing to a close, along with
the carrers of Nordoff and
Sullivan, this group of Bullet
women hope to open eyes in
the future, with talent, heart
and experiences.

Women defend crown at Messiah, men compete well

by Erika Durst
Contributing Reporter
Strong performances
were recorded by the men's
and women's track and field
teams on Saturday at the Mes
siah Invitational. Although
both teams were set back due
to illness and schedule con
flicts, the women defended
their invitational title and the
men finished strong placing
sixth. The women's team bet
tered its record by sweeping the
18-team invitational. The Bul
lets finished with 117 points,
while Dickinson was second
with 111. Other strong teams
included Roberts Wesleyan,
Susquehanna, and Lebanon
Valley.

Leading the Gettysburg
women with individual efforts
was Tabitha Gary, whose per
sonal bests of 35-0 3/4 in the
triple jump and 16-2 1/2 in the
long jump earned her first place
in both events. Karen Helmick
lead the distance squad with a
personal record of 5:10.2,
good for 6th place, and a 5 th
place finish in the 3000m run.
Other personal bests in
clude Michelle Fields' 71.48
debut in the 400m hurdles, and
Kelley Lord's 43:50.98 effort
in the 10000m run.

The women's 400m relay
team of Keri Hymen, Jackie
Klug, Emily Brown, and Andi
Therit set a new school record
with a time of 51.01. Cathy
Spangler lead the women's field
events finishing seventh place
in the shot-put, a sixth in the
discus and fourth in the ham
mer throw.
The men's team, while
missing several key athletes,
posted many exemplary perfor
mances. Gene Kraus set a new
school record with his hammer
throw of 120-9, good enough
for a runner-up title. Nathan

Grim was the shot-put winner,
recording a new invitational
record at 51-5 1/4.
The men's distance team
was headed by Jon Catlett,
placing third in the steeple
chase (9:52.96) and eighth in
the 800m run (2:02.64), and
Dave Gary, completing 25 laps
in 34:15.58, for a third place
in thelOOOOm run, and record
ing a fourteenth place in the
800m Run. Will Hanema
achieved a personal best of 12
feet in the pole vault, while
running well in the 400m run
and 1600m Relay.

Softball team rides roller-coaster to conference title

by Bill Davidson
Staff Reporter The Gettysburg softball
team experienced a roller
coaster week, hitting several
peaks and valleys before find
ing themselves back where
they had started.
A sweep of F 8c M,
paired with a Western Mary
land loss, left the Lady Bullets
in a first place tie with the
Green Terror atop the Centen
nial Conference. Then they
rolled over Albright in a non-

conference doubleheader and
were seemingly gaining mo
mentum for the weekend se
ries against conference foe
Muhlenberg. However, the
women were tripped up by the
Mules in the opener 6-5, be
fore earning the split with a 7
5 comeback victory in the sec
ond game. When the dust
cleared, they found themselves
in a familiar position, one
game behind Western Mary
land for the Centennial Con
ference lead.

In Lancaster, Melissa
Hazzard pitched 4 and 1/3 in
nings of shutout relief, while
scattering 3 hits to earn the 5-

4 victory over F &: M.
Emily Boardman singled
in the tying and what would
prove to be the winning run in
the 6th. Jill Murphy and
Marybeth Korejko once again
provided solid defensive play, in
addition to contributing multi
hit games.
In the twinbill finale,
Suzzanne Dailey was brilliant,
outdueling the Diplomats 2-0 in
a game, which did not feature
an extra base hit. Traci Bullock's
RBI single and Sara Gravehne's
sacrifice fly supplied the only of
fensive support.
The women were cruel
hosts to Albright on Thursday
outsconng them 21-5 in the
doubleheader. Graveline led
the balanced onslaught in the
first game, going three-for-three
with one RBI and two runs
scored.

Jody Noel scored three
runs, converting two walks into
stolen bases, while Sara Stokes
picked up the 11-3 win. In the
second game, Katelynn Gorton
tossed a three-hitter, allowing 0
earned runs en route to a con
vincing 10-2 triumph. Bullock
and Murphy each went 1 for 2,
driving in two and three RBI re¬

spectively.
Casey Stevens also con
tributed, going 2 for 2 and scor
ing three runs. Her efforts were
rewarded with a spot on the
Centennial Conference Honor
Roll. She batted .533 on the
week, going 8 for 15 with four
runs scored, three RBI, and two
stolen bases.
The Lady Bullets dropped
a disappointing, 6-5 decision to
Muhlenberg in the first game
on Saturday. Allowing three
unearned runs proved costly, as
they fell short in a seventh in
ning comeback. Stevens drove
in two runs on two for three
hitting in the losing effort.
Coach Mike Kirkpatrick was
not pleased with the result, but
he did not feel that his team was
overlooking the Mules. "I don't
(think we were looking ahead
to Western Maryland)," he ex
plained. "We just played a bad
game."

The women responded in
the nightcap to earn the split,
scoring three runs in the bot
tom of the 6th for a come-from
behind victory.
Karyn Miller's two RBI
double proved to be the differ
ence in the pivotal inning.
Third baseman Korejko and
shortstop Graveline repre
sented the left side of the infield
well, going three-for-three and
four-for-four, respectively. Sara
Stokes pitched six innings of
relief to pick up the win.
To this point, the Lady
Bullets have enjoyed one of
their most successful seasons in
school history, posting a 22-7
record. They conclude the sea-

Then, on Saturday, they travel

said Kirkpatrick, "then we can

Lambda Chi Alpha to become student housing
Fraternity leaves house due to financial woes

by Laura Root
Staff Reporter The house that
has belonged to the
Lambda Chi Alpha fra
ternity for years is set
to become student
housing next year. It
will stay that way for
the next two to five
years. According to
College administra
tors, fanancial troubles
and the fraternity's
small size contributed
to the decision to lease
the house.
Two years ago,
the Lambda Chi house,
located on West Broad
way, went through
some major renova
tions. To pay for these
renovations, a loan had
to be taken out.

Because of the
loan, the brotherhood
is in debt. To pay back
the debt, the Alumni
Corporation of
Lambda Chi (who
owns the house) decided
be in the best interest of

to lease their house.
The house will be leased to the
College for a maximum of five years.
At the end of each year, the fraternity
has the option to buy out the house's
occupants and move into the house the
following year.

According to Assistant Dean of
the College and Director of Greek Or
ganizations, Dennis Murphy, the
fraternity's return to their house could
take anywhere from two to five years.
The house will be open to the
brothers for receptions and meetings
during Alumni and Homecoming
Weekends.

Current chapter president, An
thony Futia insisted that the fraternity
will remain active on campus, and
hoped to move the brothers back into
the house "in the shortest possible time."
Murphy said that the house will
most likely become Honors Housing
next year. To prepare for its new resi
dents, the house will undergo some mi¬

nor renovations in
cluding a new paint
job. The use of the
Lambda Chi house
for student housing
will help to alleviate
the current housing
shortage on campus,
which has increased
the number of stu
dents living off cam
pus. The College
has current plans to
reduce the number
of students living off
campus to 200 by
the year 2000 (see
article on page 4).
Until they re
turn to the house,
Lambda Chi broth
ers will be living in
residence halls on
campus. During this
time, it will be a
"non-residential fra
ternity," where
brothers attend fra-

house.
Currently, the Lambda Chi Alpha
fraternity has 18 members. According
to Dean Murphy, that is not a large
enough membership to continue as a
brotherhood. But beyond the issue of
membership, the greater problem that
Lambda Chi faces is sustaining increas
ing costs of living while they remain in
a large amount of debt.

GCPR J. Matthew Gallman,
professor of history at Loyola
College in Baltimore, has been
named the Henry R. Luce Pro
fessor of the Civil War Era at
Gettysburg College. The first
person to be named to this
newly established position,
Gallman will begin teaching
and administrative duties of the
position in the fall.
Gallman was selected
for the post after an extensive
national search. The College

was awarded a six year grant
of approximately $600,000 last
year from the Henry Luce
Foundation to establish a pro
fessorship in the Civil War era.
Gallman will lead an under
graduate program in Civil War
studies and will develop and
direct "The Gettysburg Semes
ter," a program through which
college students from across
the country will come to
Gettysburg College for a se
mester of intensive interdisci
plinary study of the Civil War

era. "This

Trustees have awarded 316
scholarships for the 1998-99
school year to undergraduate
sophomores and juniors from
the fifty states.
Jay L. Henniger, a jun
ior physics and mathematics
major at Gettysburg College,
was one of the recipients.
Henniger, a native of Seattle,
Washington, has studied exten
sively in the fields of as
tronomy, with Dr. Larry
Marshall, and combinatorial
mathematics, under Dr. Bela
Bajnok.

Henniger is an active
member of the Society of Phys
ics Students and the Math
ematical Association of
America. In January, Henniger
and his partner Andy Danner
received Honorable Mention at
the student poster session at the

timore. The Goldwater Schol
ars were selected on the basis
of academic merit from a field
of 1,186 mathematics, science,
and engineering students who
were nominated by the facul
ties of colleges and universities
nationwide. One hundred and
eighty-three of the Scholars are
men, 133 are women, and vir
tually all intend to obtain a
Ph.D in their respective areas
of study. Nineteen scholars are
mathematics majors, 215 are
science majors, 20 are major
ing in engineering, and 62 have
dual majors in a variety of
mathematics, science, engineer
ing and computing disciplines
The one and two year
scholarships will cover the cost
of tuition, fees, books, and
room and board up to a maxi
mum of $7,500 per year.

The Scholarship Pro
gram honoring Senator Barry
M. Goldwater was designed to
foster and encourage outstand
ing students to pursue careers
in the fields of mathematics,

science and engineering. The
Goldwater Scholarship is the
premier undergraduate award
of its type in these fields.
The Foundation, now
in its tenth year, has, to date,
awarded 2,407 scholarships
worth approximately twenty
five million dollars. The Trust
ees plan to award about three
hundred scholarships for the
1999-2000 academic year.

College close to obtaining $48 million bond
Funds to pay for construction of new student housing

by Henry Fawell
Assistant News Editor
Gettysburg College is on
the verge of obtaining a $48
million bond issue from the
Gettysburg Municipal Author
ity, following a 6-2 borough
council vote Monday.
The bond will be used by
the College mainly to help fi
nance construction of new
buildings and the renovations
oi old ones. As a result, the
College hopes to minimize the
number of students living off
campus.
Members of the Hazel

Alley Association, an organiza
tion formed by area residents
to deal with off-campus hous
ing problems, have requested a
commitment from the College
that the number of students liv
ing offcampus be reduced to
200 by the upcoming fall se
mester.
Gordon Haaland, presi
dent of the College, has yet to
comply to this commitment,
despite college efforts to lower
the number by reducing admis
sions next fall and adding 150
on-campus beds by 2000.
The college's plans in
clude the construction of a new

science facility, which would
then open up dorm space, as
the present science building
would be converted into col
lege housing.
The College has already
made some immediate efforts
to alleviate the housing prob
lem. The purchase of a prop
erty on North Washington
Street and the lease of the
Lambda Chi fraternity house
(see front page) are some of
these efforts.
While the borough was
pleased by the efforts, their
overriding concern was the
college's plan to curb the un¬

civil behavior of some of its stu
dents. In an article run by The
Gettysburg Times President
Haaland said, "We have a di
lemma. We invite a group of
intelligent, ambitious young
people. They are teenagers, but
college is a time of change. We
need to use appropriate re
straints and still understand
that young people are differ
ent." These restraints may in
clude programs designed to fa
miliarize students with life
within the community, and an
orientation program for stu¬

dents who plan to live off-cam
pus. The borough council is
also doing its part to quell stu
dent behavior. An ordinance is
being discussed among the pub
lic safety Committee that would
require landlords to regulate
the behavior of student tenants.
Some behavioral prob
lems mentioned by residents
have been excessive porch fur
niture and students sunbathing
on roofs.
Concerning the council's
demands on the college, one
Gettysburg resident told The
Gettysburg Times, "If nothing
else, we got their attention."

Lukewarm L Baltimore

by George Spelvin
Contributing Reviewer
The Hot L Baltimore, the
Owl and Nightingale Players
spring production by Lanford
Wilson, is a play about a once
elegant hotel left to rot along
with its tenants until finally it
is set to be demolished. This
description does not describe
the production, and I think
that, with a couple of excep
tions, the presentation was an
elaborate success.
Directed by George
Muschamp, the gritty, realistic
drama t came to life. No easy
script to direct, Muschamp
handled the blocking brilliantly.
Everyone on stage had much
"business," yet nothing was dis
tracting. His direction of the
final fight scenes at the ends of
Acts I and II began minimally
and then little by little he added

tension; the pattern of crosses

increased the stress level and
finally the big explosion ar¬

rived. I do question the open
ing tableau. For me, it left
something unfinished. I ex
pected perhaps a da capo fin
ish or some reason for the ac
tors to be in those specific
places. In a show that is 100%
realistic, the freeze just didn't
make sense.
I also had a problem with
the third act. Now, this is not
the fault of the director or any
of the actors, but of Lanford
Wilson's. One word sums up
the final act—anticlimactic.
After the fight at the end of Act
II between Morse, Jackie, and
Katz, to have such a "blah" act
can only mean poor writing.
Additionally, some of the
loose ends seemed untied.
What will happen to everyone

in the hotel after the demoli
tion? Who knows?
The rest of the play, how
ever, was full of conflict, ten
sion, and interesting dialogue.
Also, the theme, as Muschamp
puts it in the program, of the
threatening demise of human
spontaneity appropriately ap
plies to today.
As far as the visual ele
ments, the set designed by Brian
Hershfeld was, in a word, fan
tastic. I felt as though I was
actually in a ' hotel lobby. The
detail work of the stairs, ' the
marbling, the-_^flats, etc., im
pressed me immensely. Kudos
to Anne Semple for her set
decoration. One thing did
bother me, for it _seamed quite
out of place —the mural on the
stage left catwalk. Although
drawn and painted well, it just
conflicted with the other set el
ements.

The lighting, also de
signed by Mr. Hershfeld,
worked efficiently. It was un
obtrusive and nondistracting.
However, the fade ins and outs
occurred a bit too slowly, al
lowing the audience's attention
to wander. Thank goodness for
the music; otherwise the audi
ence would have been far too
gone during the changes.
The costuming was ap
propriate, as was most of the
makeup. April (Mary Cordero)
could have used a bit more age
makeup, however.
The acting was Very good
as well. Not one cast member
really could qualify as miscast
or as a "bad actor." Overall,
the actors handled the difficult
timing with success at most
points. All were very believ
able in the massive fight scene
at the end of act one.
However, as with any

production, there were some
standouts. Duncan Niederer as
Mr. Morse knew exactly what
he was doing. More impres
sive than his speaking lines was
his ability to just sit around
during Act III. It takes great
concentration to act when say
ing nothing, and he certainly
deserves applause for his silent
performance in that final act.
Additionally, I loved his
checker-fight with Jaime (Paul
Lapato).
Brad Cerilli as Bill Lewis
also performed well. His fa
cial expressions were excellent.
He had the most stage business
of any of the actors and not
once could I say he was dis
tracting or unrealistic.

Reel Hits & Misses _ T r . A
Falling Angels

by Dan Larktn and Mike Petro
Movie Columnists
Do you believe in angels?
Maybe you do or maybe you
don't. Perhaps your faith
might tell stories of angels and
you take their existence on
faith, and perhaps you just
think it is all just myths and
fairy tales.
Angels are certainly all
the rage these days. They're on
all sorts of pins and bumper
stickers, and there's that annoy
ing TV show that my mom likes
so much. So, I fi gured that City
of Angels would be yet another
f oray into pop spirituality.
The new movie City of
Angels takes a look at the an
gels of our world. According
to the story, angels are all
around us and even though we
cannot see them, they are al
ways there. They hear music
in the sunrise, feel no pain or
other human emotions, can
read anyone's mind, and are

messengers of God. These di
vine beings operate around us
all the time.
One such messenger,
Seth, turns up one day during
a heart surgery that has gone
wrong. During the trauma of
the moment, the chief surgeon,
Dr. Maggie Rice, played by
Meg Ryan (Joe vs. the Volcano,
Amityville 3-D) while working
feverishly on her dying patient,
sees Seth in the room and hears
him too. The patient dies; Seth
had come for him.
Maggie, confused and
bewildered, ends up in a stair
well sobbing, thoughts of what
went wrong spinning in her
head, and as she cries, Seth is
there, longing to reveal himself
to her, yet knowing nothing of
what he feels inside.

This turns out to be the
telling moment of the film: it
is where Seth, played with
charm and charisma by Nicho
las Cage (Zandalee, Trapped in
Paradise), falls in love with

Maggie.
Cage is one of my favor
ite actors, though he's been
slumming since Leaving Las
Vegas, but even his mediocre
performances are pretty good.
He does an okay job in this
movie, but he doesn't act so
much as stare soulfully at Meg
Ryan throughout the movie.
Troubled by his thoughts
of love, and intrigued by the
interaction he wants to have
with Maggie, Seth seeks coun
sel with his partner of sorts,
Cassiel, played by Homicide's
Andr e Braugher. Seth learns
of the ability for an angel to
"fall" to earth and become hu¬

man. This part reminded me a
lot o/"Superman II, when Clark
gives up his powers in order to
have a relationship with Lois.
And Nick Cage will be playing
Superman in a new movie next
year. Ah, the irony.
The rest of the movie fo
cuses around the conflict of

emotions between the two
main characters and the
struggle each has with their
emotions. Both are assisted in
understanding by Nathaniel
Messinger, a fallen angel him
self, played extremely well by
Dennis Franz (Sipowicz!), a joy
in a often sad movie.
I'm a big fan of Dennis
Franz on NYPD Blue, but I was
worried when I saw that he was
in this, we wouldn't see his na
ked butt. I shouldn 't have wor
ried. He does a pretty good job
with the acting.
This is a well put to
gether, if not sometimes sappy
love story. I love the visual
imagery of the movie and I like
the conceptualization of what
an angel is. I think it works as
a romance and as a means to
spiritual exploration.

The actors are very good
together as well. Franz and
Braugher give solid perfor
mances that are reflective of
their excellent talents, and

Cage and Ryan are both excel
lent in their own right.
The visuals of this movie
are very impressive. I liked the
scenes with the angels on the
rooftops. It wasn't over-the-top
special effects wizardry, like
Fifth Element (about which I
might have been a little over
zealous in an earlier statement
I made about the Oscars), but
just really nice camera shots.
This is a very watchable
film and I found myself liking
it very much. For a good,
thought provoking and roman
tic movie to cleanse your pal
ate before the summer explo
sion fest, see City of Angels*
Three and a half out of five

stars. I can't say that I found
this movie thought-provoking
It made me sad. I guess you
could call it tear-provoking?
Though fairly predictable, City
of Angels is a nice romantic
tear-jerker. Two and seven
eighths stars (out of five).

80's Brat Pack flick provokes laughter and thought

In Case You Missed It

by Eileen O'Donnell
Movie Columnist
What happens when five
teenagers are locked together
in a library for a whole Satur
day? John Hughes' moving tale
about teen angst, The Breakfast
Club, asks this question.
Starring Molly Ringwald
(Pretty in Pink, Sixteen
Candles), Emiho Estevez
(Maximum Overdrive), Ally
Sheedy (Maid to Order), An
thony Michael Hall (Weird Sci
ence), and Judd Nelson (TV's

Suddenly Susan), The Breakfast
Club was released at the height
of Brat Pack fame. These five
stars were the stock actors and
actresses for adolescent films of
the early to mid 1980's.
Ringwald and Hall starred to
gether in Sixteen Candles.
Nelson, Sheedy, and Estevez
were all together again in St.
Elmo's Fire, which also starred
Rob Lower, Andi MacDowell_,
Demi Moore, and Andrew
McCarthy.
An emotionally complex

film, The Breakfast Club has
very little action. The setting
is a Saturday detention in the
library of Shermer High School

i n
Shermer, I
Illinois.
The five
students,
Andy Clark,
the Jock I
(Estevez);
Brian
Johnson,
the Brain
(Hall);
John Bender,
the Criminal (Nelson);
Claire

Standish, the Princess
(Ringwald); and Allison
Reynolds, the Basket Case
(Sheedy), are required to write
an essay saying who they think
they are.
On the surface, The
Breakfast Club is a movie about

five kids who are serving de
tention for breaking various
rules. On this level, the movie
elicits both laughter and tears

as the students antagonize the
detention monitor, Mr. Vernon
(Paul Gleason_, the nemesis of
Eddie Murphy and Dan
Aykroyd in Trading Places) and
each other.
On a much deeper level,
Hughes explores stereotypes,

generalizations, and confor
mity. He attempts to make
sense of a teenager's need to fit
in and be accepted by his or her
peers.

Not
only
does
Hughes
explore
the atti
tudes of
teenag
ers to
wards
their
peers,
but he
also ex
amines the rela
tionships of teens
The film

with their parents.
begins with each kid being
dropped off by his or her par
ents. Interestingly, Brian's
mother is played by Hall's real
mother, Mercedes Hall. And
making a cameo as Brian's fa
ther is Hughes.

Mr. Vernon, meanwhile,
sees the students under his care
in the broadest terms and in the
most convenient categories, not
for the people they are.
Hughes directed many "of
the Brat Pack films that we can
all remember. He is respon
sible for Sixteen Candles, Pretty
in Pink, Ferris Bueller's Day
Off, Some Kind of Wonderful,
and Weird Science.
Hughes has also directed
National Lampoon's Vacation,
European Vacation, and Christ
mas Vacation, as well as Uncle
Buck, Mr. Mom, The Great
Outdoors, and Home Alone 1
3. The film is full of honest
feelings, and the dialogue is
brutally frank. The Breakfast
Club is one of those rare films
that makes you think, but
makes you laugh at the same
time.

If you take anything away
from this movie, remember
this: "Screws fall out all the
time; the world's an imperfect
place." -John Bender

Our third place winner,
Stephanie, agreed to have her
entry published in the paper, so
here it is:

thing catches my eye.
A black form, a few feet
to my right, sits in the sand. 1
approach the figure and I can
see that it moves, awkwardly
No, it hobbles, crippled. As 1
get closer, it tries to move away
but it can't; it struggles as if the
beach has suddenly become
quicksand.
I am close enough to see
what it is now, a creature of the
air, imprisoned on the earth by
a blackness, cruel and unnatu
ral. Her eyes are shut, glued
by the black goo that separates
her feathers into stiff spikes,
like a porcupine, but these
spikes are no defense mecha
nism; they are an encumbrance,
rather, heavy chains that pre
vent her from taking flight as
she was born to do.

It's still a beautiful day
Blue sky, hardly a cloud, but the
sun screams Icarus. I imagine
how that boy must have felt,
trying to defy nature with his
foolish wings. Invincible. But
he died of natural causes. This
bird, however, may never reach
the sun again. She will not
melt, but she may suffocate in
the black stains deposited by
the Icaruses of the earth.
I reach out, and pick up
the black, sticky mass of plum
age, as a tear falls from my sun
blocked face and mixes with
the sympathetic salt of the
ocean.

It's a beautiful day. Blue
sky, hardly a cloud, and a sun
that screams Helios. The UV
rays brighten every melancholy
face. A perfect day for the
beach. So I pack my 100% UV
resistant sunglasses and a bottle
of 15 SPF: skin cancer preven
tion fluid. As I walk along the
water's edge, black sand sticks
to my feet. I forgot my all
natural cork flip-flops. I wade
into the water to wash off the
gritty oil. While scraping the
sewage from my feet with a
piece of broken glass, some-

Memones

Junction was called the Dive.
I remember when the li
ons at SAE had noses!
I remember when ' frater
nities had parties three nights a
week. I remember when I was a
freshman, the real world didn't
look quite as scary.
Chrissy Shott: I think one
of my many fond memories of
Gettysburg College was know
ing Casey Dunn. She brought
joy to the hearts of all who
knew her, and kindness to those
she encountered. I miss my
bond with her as a friend, sis
ter, fellow student, and close
confidant.

Buhrman. I remember one
time when he wanted to de
frost the fridge, so he got out
a screwdriver and hammer to
chip away the ice. Jn doing so,
he struck the gas line and was
propelled backwards into the
bathroom! We watched the
geyser of freon for a few min
utes, then he thought that
freon would give him cancer,
so he left. I opened a window.

Mike Wooden: My most
memorable experience of col

Rebecca Babbitt: One
memory is of when a fraternity
boy--"Corey"~crossed my best
friend, Kate. Kate and I de
cided to get even by removing
all of his clothing from his
closet and drawers. His room
mate told us which clothes
were Corey's. We walked right
out of the house with a
trashbag full of clothes during
a party and nobody said a
thing! We got an angry phone
call the next morning from the
roommate; he had pointed out
his own clothes and didn't
have any underwear!

Jaime Foanio: One of my
funniest memories has to be my
trip to Cancun for spring break
my sophomore year. We got
there and did not have a hotel.
We fought for a place to stay
and ended up in this really
creepy place. We were walked
up to our rooms with candles,
no other lighting. The next day
we fought hard and ended up
with a room at another hotel;
of course it was about $100
cheaper than what we actually
paid. To compensate, they sent
us a free weekend stay at the
hotel. I'm don't think I will be
going back there anytime

soon...

pletely believable and executed
her lines with a comic grace
unlike any other. I would ditch
the wig, though.
Samantha Gregg per
formed the role of Jackie, a
tough New York lesbian. In this
role, her versatility as an actress
took her far. She completely
inhabited the character in
voice, posture, movement, and
mind. This was some of the
best acting I have ever seen, not
only from her, but on the Kline

me wanting more of her char

last week, I automatically as
sumed that I would use these
last few-hundred words to get
my final revenge, to blast all
that I dislike and to bid a fi
nal farewell to this asinine life.
But, I have done enough
of that over the past four
years. I have made enough
enemies and lost enough
friends.
Instead, I would like to
take this space to thank those
people who have positively
affected my college career. It
will read like an Academy
Awards speech, but I feel it is
important to publicly ac¬

knowledge those people who
have made a difference.
First, there are many
friends and acquaintances who I
want to mention. It is often said
that most of the learning done
in college takes place outside of
the classroom. Without these
friends, I fear I would have
learned very little. I want to rec
ognize Kate Naughton, for read
ing my mind and always listen
ing to me; Laura Garncarz, who
taught me the wonders of the
Chicken Truck; Joanna Bucci,
for always making me laugh;
Amy Sedor, for going to break
fast with me all those times;
Laura Benicasa, who helped me
through some of the hardest
times; Susannah Kopcho, for just
being herself. I also want to
thank Hutch, Mike Wooden,
Corey Ehrenworth, Julie
Wilmer, Colleen Gormley, Erica
Duchnowski, Mark Gorman and
Andrew Spitilari, who are all
wonderful people and good

friends.
Teaching is a noble occu
pation; unfortunately, there are
few people who fulfill the re
quirements of being a great
teacher. I have been lucky to
know some of the professors
who are brilliant, not only in
their field of study, but also as
teachers. Some of these people
are Dr. Charles "Buzz" Myers,
who taught me to think for
myself and to value my ideas;
Dr. Timothy Shannon, from
whom I learned that good
enough is never good enough;
and Dr. Jack Ryan, whose pa
tience, understanding, and sup
port are enough to nominate
him for sainthood. I also must
take time to appreciate some
administrators, namely, Anne
Lane in Academic Advising,
Julie Ramsey and Tim Rupe in
College Life, and Assistant
Chaplain Bill Gohl. These men
and women have taught
through demonstration what a

good leader and confidant
should be.
And then there are those
who have already gone.
Former Pastor Nadine Lehr was
an important influence in my
life. She taught me that you can
get pissed off and still be a good
Christian. Will Siss ('94) and
Brett Forshey, Eric Chalek, and
Jeannie Welch ('97) challenged
me to think for myself and just
have a good time. Most nota
bly however, is Casey Dunn,
who taught me how to laugh
at myself.
I need not mention the
importance of the Gettysburg
ian to me over the last four
years. The many people who
have served on the staff have
put up with me and my mood
swings with grace and dirty
jokes. They have always chal
lenged me to see the big pic
ture and to "fight injustice, to
right that which is wrong and
to serve all mankind!"

I must also acknowledge
my sisters in Alpha Xi Delta,
without whom I would be
nothing. I hope they know
how much I love them.
Last, but far from least, I
thank my family: my mother
and father who have always
stood by me and loved me,
even when I messed up and dis
appointed them. They taught
me well and have given me all
that I desire; my sister, Bryanne
(a.k.a. Flakes) who has been
just as much a friend as a sis
ter; my grandmother, who I
admire for her hard work and
dedication to her family, and
my grandfather, who reads ev
ery word of this newspaper ev
ery week. I love you!
I know that this has been
sappy, but it needed to be said.
My life has been enriched by
knowing these people. Please,
don't wait until your senior
year to start appreciating those
around you.

Jason Hatheway

"Just throw the ball over
the plate this time ya yutz!"
Hateway clamored as he
swung the Wiffle Ball bat back
and forth over the imaginary
plate that was really only a
worn place in the grass where
they had stood for the whiffle
ball game the day before.
They were playing along the
backside of the College
Chapel which had a giant
brick cross imbedded in the
three story wall. This was
what the hitter was supposed
to aim at to score points. The
system was complicated and
new rules always had to be
made to make up for discrep
ancies. It seemed sacrilegious
to smack a ball against the
back side of a chapel, espe
cially on a Sunday when there
was a service inside.

Eric just looked intently
as he pitched the plastic ball
covered with electrical tape
towards the "plate". "Swing
at something!"
"Throw it over the

plate." "Swing at something."
"Throw it over the plate."
"Look. I am up by seven
points, so just swing." Eric
looked exasperated. Apparently
he was looking forward to a meal
of rice products and Bisquick
Biscuits that had been made two
days before and the thirty tons
of hot dogs that he had shuffled
off during a victimized school
picnic. In truth, the boys had be
come experts at the scrounge. It
had started when the year before

was spent in Servo carrying
plates of chicken fingers, which
were the equivalent to finding
gold, to a plastic bag and then
carrying about twenty pounds of
these delectables in a covert op
eration back to the apartment
where they would eat dinner
while watching them Duke boys
out maneuver Fatty Whites and
Crony Cop. From there it had
led to even greater exploits in
cluding frequent raids on depart
ment picnics.
Well, the Redman was

starting to taste bad. Actually
they couldn't taste it at all.
Hateway's mouth was so numb
from the chew that he was slur
ring his words. He knew that
if he didn't get rid of the taste
by that night he would prob
ably drool on his pillow. All of
a sudden food sounded very
good to him. Any attempt to
see if his taste buds were still
functioning seemed much more
important than waiting for the
ideal pitch.
"I quit."

"You should."
"Okay, let's eat. C'mon."
Back at the apartment
they were once again made
aware of the fact that there was
not one kitchen utensil that was
clean except the sponge. The
plates had been there for God
knows how long. Eric and
Brett, the proprietors of Tudor
six, attempted at all costs to
avoid the mess. They had
hoped with people like
Hateway and others always us
ing the apartment for their per¬

sonal playground that these
people would sooner or later
clean it for them. They were
often right. The sink was gur
gling and if one tried to put
their head within a three foot
radius of the sink, it was obvi
ous that something was decay
ing in there.
Eric opened the fridge.
The sink would once again be
left to its own devices.
"Hot dog?" Eric yelled
from the fridge.
"Yeah, and grab me a bis¬

cuit too." So much for rice.
They went out on the
back porch with hot dogs
speared on plastic forks and
crumbling stale biscuits in the
other hand. The porch was a
fire escape and the area be
tween the metal slats allowed
the food that did not make it
into the mouth to fall onto the
wood deck of the neighbors
below. All of a sudden it was
their problem; if they didn't
clean it up it was their fault if
their porch became a feeding

ground for the carnivorous
squirrels in the area.
Although they were on
the shady side of the building
they could see the sunset re
flecting off the sides of the
buildings as they ate in silence.
Hateway finished his hot dog
and realized that he was prob
ably going to be sick if he didn't
get the taste out of his mouth.
The biscuit had no moisture in
it and only the saliva that was
forming from the aftertaste of
the chew was allowing him to

digest it. He lit a cigarette and
offered one to Eric who took
it and, as Hateway expected,
puffed on it without inhaling.
It just hung from his lips.
Hateway inhaled his cigarette
and felt the food he had just
eaten hit the lower regions of
his stomach. The wind picked
up a little and they felt the qui
etness only pierced by the J
brake of the trucks a few streets
away. It was all so simple, easy
and wonderful. At the very
least, it was ideal.


Senior Staff Reflections
AANIEA AAPKIN

People like me who re
member when the Junction was
called the Dive, and when the
Honor Code had a semicolon
instead of a comma are fast
becoming in short supply
around here, so as closing time
approaches, I guess it's only
natural to look back and reflect
on the past four years.
I stood at The Gettys
burgian table at Get Acquainted
Day last weekend "getting ac
quainted" with people I'll never
get to know. As I met and
spoke with some of these soon
to-be first years, I was made
hopeful. A lot of these kids
seemed enthusiastic and ex
cited to be coming to college,
eager to become involved. I
was jealous, jealous not to be
able to know and work with
these people, and jealous of the

opportunity that lay before
them. But just when something
like that happens to make me
upset to be leaving this place, I
have the eggs splattered on my
door by my rowdy neighbors
and the obnoxious freshmen in
my softball class to make me
think otherwise.
But then I think of how
good I have it right now. I will
never be able to live so pam
pered a lifestyle again. I will
never live in such close prox
imity to my closest friends in
all the world again. I will never
again be able to obtain a meal
merely by producing a little
plastic card. I probably won't
be able to sleep until eleven
o'clock so much anymore ei
ther. And I won't be able to
schedule my life around The
Simpsons.

For all the little things
about Gettysburg that piss me
off on a fairly regular basis,
there's so much I'm going to
miss about this place.
I'm going to miss my
close friends, of course. But I'll
stay in touch with them. I'm
not worried about that. But
what I'm going to miss most is
the friends that I probably
won't see after graduation.
Members of my classes, people
from my first-year residence
hall, friends who I've drifted
apart from- my casual friends,
who I'll never see again.
I'm going to miss this
newspaper. Staying up 'till
some ungodly hour, pouring
your heart and soul into a little
publication that nobody appre
ciates might not be everyone's
idea of a good time, but I can't
think of anything else I'd rather

do on Wednesday nights. It
appeals to the masochist in me,
I suppose. Despite the occa
sional inaccuracies and errors
the 'Burgian suffers from time
to time, I'm awfully proud of
it. In fact, I'm prouder of the
front page story from last April,
"Squirrel attacks student", than
just about anything I've ever
written.
I came to Gettysburg as a
quiet, shy, short-haired guy
with no idea what I was going
to do with my life. Strangely
enough, that's a pretty accurate
description of me now.
But lots of stuff has hap
pened along the way. Two ma
jors. Five roommates. Three
pairs of glasses. Two hair-col
ors. Lots of different hair
lengths. Going cornin'. Break
ing up with my high-school
girlfriend. Spanish 201. The

nudist special interest house.
My first sports-related injury.
James Joyce, Friedreich
Nietzsche, and Toni Morrison.
The professors of the English
and Philosophy departments.
The Gettysburgian. Grogan.
Fry. In some countries, rice is
bread. Todd, Sib, and Kenny
Phi Delta Crow. _Al. Leroy -
R.I.P., Petro, my favorite movie
date. Heidi. The Vons. Mon
keys, monkeys, monkeys. Meri.
Lonneke. Nelson. Kari. The
phonathon. Tyler. Little Man
Hate. Lennon and Suzie. Win
ning a t-shirt from Servo.
Ambro. Carol. Marsupials and
monotremes. My (now
broken) streak of staying until
the end ever Wednesday. Eric
and Brett's opening day party.
Becca, Barb, Melodie, Pepper,
Spicer, and Sara. Wee wee ra
dio. Batman's a scientist. Molly.

As I sit here to pen my fi
nal words to Gettysburg Col
lege, I am forced to reflect
upon who I have become in the
past four years. While this is
something that I think about
daily, I never really thought I
would be putting it on paper.
Thanks to The Gettys
burgian for giving me the plat
form to speak my mind, play
with voices, and voice my cyni
cism. Also, special thanks to
everyone down in that office.
You have given me so many
fond memories, Wednesday
nights will never be the same
in my life again.
I came to college as an
idealistic, yet admittedly nar
row-minded individual. I
thought that I knew everything,
and I was sure that I could share
that omnipotence with every
one. What I soon came to find

out is that I knew very little. I
was miserable in my first
months at Gettysburg. I may

and of my home town, but
what I didn't know was how to
adjust myself to the new life of
college.
Thankfully, I finally
ended up with a close group of
friends, and we have remained,
through thick and thin, closely
knit. I will miss them all and
truly hope we remain in touch
as the years drift on. Of the
things that I will miss most, one
is staying up until sunrise, talk
ing with a small group of
friends, no one wanting to
leave for fear they would miss
something. To me, that exem
plifies the college experience.
Another fond memory
that I have is of the particularly
friendly staffs of facilities,
health, safety and security, and
dining services. I can tell you
that the friendliness of both

these respective organizations
on campus did not go unno
ticed. Although it is not said
enough, I thank all of you for

p
joyable experience.
I have taken full advan
tage of the liberal arts educa
tion here at Gettysburg, sam
pling from most of the depart
ments and participating in a
variety of activites. If you are
a first year and you are reading
this, please heed my words:
don't let the opportunities
Gettysburg has to offer pass
you by. And if you have been
here for two or three years, it
is never too late. Go out and
try something new, go abroad,
go on a service learning project,
do an internship or anything
else that gets you off campus!
You will never truly appreciate
all that Gettysburg gives you
until you step away.

However, my experience
here was not all positive. In my
time here I have been exposed
to the truths that our peers rape
and are raped, take their own
lives, suffer horrific injury and

, often
than I wanted to admit, act
without consideration given to
anyone else other than them
selves.
Moreover, I learned that
sometimes, even when you are
right, you fight city hall and
lose. To the administration of
this college, my college, you
screwed up badly with the ten
ure debacles of the past year.
The tenure system here is se
verely flawed, and without re
vision it will continue to drag
down the quality of the educa
tional product that this institu
tion has to offer.
And to my professors, I
thank all of you, especially ev
ery professor that ever took the
time to get to know me.

To Professor DeClair,
thank you for being the con
summate teacher, and for push
ing me to do my best work. My
only regret is that I didn't push
until the last. You gave your all
every day for your students; I

wish I had done the same for
you. If one of life's lessons
crystallized as a result of this
all, it was to never give up on
that which you truly believe in.
Finally, to Professor
Borock, I offer my sincerest
thanks and gratitude. I heard
all the horror stories and they
were all wrong. I know I
couldn't have found a better
advisor, mentor, and friend in
the faculty here at Gettysburg.
I thank you on behalf of all my
fellow students, you are a true
friend to the students here.
This college as a whole
has been good to me, and I shall
always look back upon my four
years here with great fondness.
As I prepare to move onward
to a new chapter of life, it is
with a mix of excitement and

sadness. Thanks to Gettysburg
College and the people who
touched my life for preparing
me to always strive for great
ness. I will.


The realities of sexual assault

Sexual Assault Aware
ness week was the result of
the work of a group of stu
dents, faculty, and support
staff who recognize that our
campus is not immune to the
problems of the world, and
that sexual assault is one of
these problems. Sexual as
sault is a tradition here at
Gettysburg, and that tradi
tion is continuing.
This past weekend a
young woman was raped by
two men on this campus, two
men she knew well and
thought were her friends.
Two men she trusted. Two

To the Editor:

men who took that trust and
violated it - violated her.
Now they are walking
around this campus as if
nothing has happened. Per
haps one of them sits next to
you in class, or is a member
of a club with you. Perhaps
one is your fraternity
brother, or one is your best
friend. As she prepares her
self to deal with this trau
matic experience for the rest
of her life, these two men
(are they worthy to be called
men? Animals is a better
term.), are free to do this to
another woman.

There are people on
this campus who were of
fended by Sexual Assault
Awareness Week. Why?
Was there something in the
message that made you ques
tion your own actions?

Other people do not believe that
rape occurs here. Let it be said
to you all - race and economic
background do not determine
who rapes. The "fine upstand
ing well-to-do students" of Get
tysburg College are capable of
rape. Students at our campus
rape their fellow classmates.
This is a fact, whether you want
to admit it or not.
I've heard people on this
campus say that because they do
not know a woman who has
been raped, that it must not hap
pen here, or that, because few
cases have been made public, it

does not happen often. WAKE
UP! Simply because someone
chooses not to come forward to
let the campus know what has
happened to him or her, does
not mean that sexual assault is
not occurring!
And why would a woman
who has been raped want to
come forward on this campus?
Repeatedly, women who are vic
tims of sexual assault are
shunned by their friends when
they confide in them and are told
not to "rock the boat." On this
campus, it's "unpopular" to have
been raped.

But it still happens,
doesn't it? You all saw the wall
full of stories of sexual assault
in the CUB during Sexual As
sault Awareness Week-it's hap
pening, and it's happening often.
Ninety percent of all rapes
involve alcohol; as more and
more parties move off campus,

from under the watchful eyes of
security and the administration,
it is vital that we look out for
each other. How many times
have you laughed at that woman
who was so drunk she had no
idea what was going on around
her? Funny isn't it, but she is a
wonderful candidate for rape.
Go to parties with a group
of friends, and more impor
tantly, LEAVE WITH THEM.
And take those people home
who need help getting home
safely, even if you do not know
them. What you may think is
an inconvenience is really an act
of consideration, and this act
may be what keeps that person
from being raped that night.
Wouldn't you want someone to
extend that courtesy to you?

So, when you come back
to campus in the fall, talk about
sexual assault. Tell your friends,
tell the first-year students in par
ticular, that Gettysburg is not the
safe care-free environment that
we pretend it is. Let's take a
stand as a campus against these
acts of violence, and work to
eliminate them. If we continue
to ignore this madness, then we
have neglected our responsibili
ties to each other, and to those
people who have already been
victims.

Consider this.

As the seniors make their
final statements and exert their
last round of influence over
the College, and admissions
begins preparations to wel
come a new first-year class,
The Gettysburgian will take a
moment to reflect on the past
academic year.
We've reflected on many
serious and not-so-serious is
sues this semester: sexual as
sault, eating disorders, large
prehistoric creatures wreaking
havoc on campus, rowdy stu
dents wreaking havoc on cam
pus, AIDS, housing, and the
fact that our pig is still miss
ing. On a more serious note,
we would like to take a mo
ment to remember those we
have lost this year. Casey
Dunn was a bright spot in
many people's lives. She
touched everyone who knew
her, and we on The Gettys
burgian staff feel privileged
that she was one of us. She
left an impression on Gettys
burg College, and we will
never forget her.
This year has been an
eventful one. One of the ma
jor academic buildings on

campus was threatened with a
bomb, Fiona Apple didn't come,
fraternities were closed down,
Bob Dole spoke to many
(though many were turned
away). South Park found an at
tentive audience—attentive for
our generation. Campus social
events didn't revolve around fra
ternity parties, as more events
were open to the whole campus
and BYOB.
Now it's time to look to
wards next year. We'll welcome
the class of 2002 (the members
of whom are the first class to
have been born in the 1980's)
and realize just what the class of
1998 meant to us. We'll see the
places they left, and we'll look
to others to fill those places. But
the spaces held in our hearts for
them will never be filled.'

Who knows what will hap
pen next year—who will come
here, what will happen, and
where will we and our friends
end up. Is there a future presi
dent among the ranks or, per
haps a Nobel prize winner? The
future is a blank slate, and it is
up to us to fill it. Whether we
do this from Gettysburg or from
the Real World, we are the fu
ture. Go out there and grab it.

Reducing risk through behavior and education

I'm really glad to see
the 'burgian helping edu
cate students with respect
to health matters, but the
article in the April 23rd is
sue raises some serious
concerns here at the health
center.
In the 2nd paragraph
of the 2nd column, the
reader is told that "the
only way to protect your
self (from HIV) is by ab
staining from intercourse
or by you and your part
ner getting tested."
This is most certainly
not true. Although ab-

Conflict and Consensus

To the Editor

staining from sexual inter
couise MAY reduce ones risk
there are LOTS of risky sexual
behaviors that don't involve
"intercourse." In fact some of
the worst cases of sexually
transmitted disease that I've
seen are in people who have
not had intercourse. Any ex
change of blood or body flu
ids, oral, anal, or genital, is as
sociated with the risk of
infection,certainly of HIV but
also of other bloodborne dis
eases like hepatitis B.
In addition, being tested
for HIV is NOT a protective
measure. It lets one know,

within the parameters of accu
racy of the test, whether he/she
is positive or negative for anti
bodies to the virus. It is our
behavior that protects us or
puts us at risk.
Education and HIV status
give us important information
that may or may not effect our
behavior! What we need to do
is to influence readers to
change their behavior if it is
putting them, or others, at risk.

Connie Songer

They're all foreign policy presidents

by John Dunlap
Political Columnist
No matter what the po
litical background of a Presi
dent, it is the historic pattern
that chief executives make their
mark in foreign, not domestic
policy. Richard Nixon visited
China and established detente
with the Soviet Union. Gerald
Ford dealt with the fall of Viet
nam, middle east shuttle diplo
macy and Detente with the So
viets. Former Georgia gover
nor and President Jimmy

Carter concentrated on human
rights, and his greatest achieve
ment was the Camp David Ac
cord between Israel and Egypt.
President Reagan took on the
Soviet Union, and towards the
end of his presidency_^ because
they were changing, he made
peace with Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev. Finally
president George Bush was at
tacked for spending to much
time on foreign policy. , Presi
dent Bush dealt with the Per
sian Gulf War, Middle East
peace and the fall of commu¬

. As governor, Bill Clinton
attacked President Bush in
1992 for not concentrating
more on domestic policy. Now,
President Clinton has joined his
predecessors, and yes, _eyen Bill
Clinton is a foreign policy
president. Two weeks ago he
was in Africa, last week he was
in Latin America and next week
he will be in London for the G
7 Economic Summit. Early in
his first term, the new president
had trouble in the foreign

policy arena. The disaster and
outright humiliation of the
United States, as American
troops were dragged through
the _streets of Mogadishu _^ So
malia ., Bill Clinton _seepied at
home when it came tp_.calking
about the budget or health
care, not nuclear weapons or
international terrorism.
This began to change in
1995, as for the first time in
forty'years the Republican
Party took control of Congress.
The new Congress and its Con
tract with America* were not
overly concerned with the
Clinton domestic agenda. Even
if presidents cannot get their
domestic agenda through the
Congress, they have virtual
complete control of the foreign
policy agenda and policies of
the United States. I am often a

very big critic of the Clinton
_Administration but by the end
of first term, the American mis
sion, in : both Haiti i and the
_former Yugoslavia had, gone
better than,anyone expected.
The president used for
eign policy to his advantage in
the 1996 presidential cam
paign, which originally was
supposed to be a Republican
issue. Foreign policy is not as
popular of an issue as it was tin
past decades due to the Cold
War, hut jt is still an area where
presidents can get things done
without having to deal with
Congress or the Washington
bureaucracy. Foreign
policy has also been heightened
by the fact that the President's
second term Secretary of State
Madeline Albright is very ac¬

tive, unlike the very laid back
term number one Secretary of
State Warren Christopher. The
administration with Madeline
Albright has gotten more in
volved in the Middle East pro
cess and has taken a tougher
stand with Iraq and United
Nations weapons inspectors.
The President personally got
involved in the peace process
within Northern Ireland and it
paid off in the form of a peace
deal has been reached. Now
Bill Clinton, the peace-maker

is looking to get involved in the
situation in Cyprus between the
Turks and the Greeks.
Part of Bill Clinton's
work in the foreign policy
arena has to deal with econom
ics. With an interdependent
world and expanding free
trade, the President has focused
on expanding trade to South
America and Africa. The presi
dent suffered a defeat on fast
track to Chile but that does not
seem to have held him back as
he continues to fight to open
markets for American goods.

A major reason for the
president's recent emphasis in
peace and security around the
world is due to the fact that
Washington is not the best
place in the world for him.
With continuing sex scandals
and the ongoing media focus
on Monica Lewinsky, the Presi
dent is being undermined in the
nation's capital. Around the
world his leadership is easier to
establish. That's why the for
eign-policy tilt of the Clinton
Administration will probably
continue until his resignation,
oops I mean retirement.

Columnist I had fun on Saturday
night. No, I didn't go out,
booze up, and not'remember
what I did the next morning. I
went to the Black Student
Union's Step Show. It was awe
some. I seriously did not ex
pect so many people to be
there, but I couldn't even see
over the crowd" in front of me.
I also didn't k_^now, What to ex
pect. I mean, I had see step
shows on television before, but
not in person. I wanted to see
the cool routines that these
young men and, women had
practiced hard for ( ., Stepping is
something that takes a lot of
hard work and dedication, not
to mention coordination.

Not to my surprise, Pro
fessor Gray from the African
American Studies _Department
stepped forward to say a few
words. A lot of faculty advi
sors do that at certain events.
What I didn't expect_,was what
came next. Professor Gray pro
ceeded to explain that there
were "concerns'* expressed
throughout the campus as to
what was part of, the content
of the step show, meaning
sexual moves. Some people
were concerned that what we

students would see over the
next hour and a half would
corrupt us in some way. I
thought that was ridiculous.
Then I looked around the room
and saw about four security
guards standing in ' the door
ways. That's more than there
were when Bob Dole came here
to speak. What made these
concerns rise all of a sudden?
Could itbe that these
people who were so worried
about our well-being were so
closed-minded that they
couldn't get past the fact that

it was a show performed by
African-Americans? Were these
people scared that in a : matter
of an hour we would walk out
of the Ballroom as the prover
bial "gang-bangers"? That is
ludicrous. '
If I'm right, Gettysburg is
working towards a more cultur
ally-diverse campus.. r ]_fw can
_thjsyiappen when _#eo_|_i|e dan't
take a step show at face value?
If these concerned citizens of
ouncamaus are _worried about
our exposure to explicit situa
tions, why don't they watch
MTV once in a while (which is
channel 51 on the college-sup
ported cable)? Maybe they
should check out Fiona Apple's
"Criminal" video. Thecollege
was all for Ms. Apple coming
here _^ while her video with her
prancing around in her under
wear was winning MTV Video
Music Awards. But when

people from the area would
like to come and gjvea step
show, all of a sudden, we stu
dents are being corrupted.
My assignment to ' the
"concerned" citizens of ' Gettys
burg College is to open their
mind ' s. I know that I enjoyed
the Step Show way more ' than
I would have enjoyed Fiona
Apple's concert (if " she had
shown). I am still the same
person, that I was Saturday be
fore I went to the step show. I
didn't start toting a gun because

I was "exposed" to an aspect
of AfricanAmerican life that I
had not formerly been _Ii) con
tact ( with. Actually_^ I adfriire
those men and women wHo
came to Gettysburg ' _^nd per
formed for us. They _Vvjere ex
cellent, ' and you can t ' efl that
they spent a lot of tirrie prac
ticing; for this. I look forward
to the next BSU sponsored step
show, and I look forward to
coming back to a more open
minded campus in the fall.



Enjoy
yourselves

the future. And that is where
the depression part comes in.
Please, take my word that
I am not anti-education and I'm
definitely not anti-money. I am
simply pro-fun. People, enjoy
yourselves! I can't think of a
bigger tragedy than to go home
after two semesters of hard
work and to spend the entire
summer going to work in an
office. Granted, it's inevitable
that most of us will eventually
end up in offices for at least one
summer prior to graduating.

by Rick Deutsch
Columnist Unless you're like me and
are postponing it for as long as
possible, most of you are prob
ably looking for internships for
this summer to bulk up your
resume. We've all been told
that next to grad school, an in
ternship in our possible termi
nal field of expertise is the most
important asset when applying
for jobs. That's probably true,
but isn't there anyone else out

there that is completely de
pressed by planning for the fu
ture? Think about our school
ing process: we go to grade
school to prepare for junior
high, then to junior high to pre
pare for high school, then on
to high school to prepare for
college, and finally to college
to prepare for our jobs. Maybe
you haven't noticed, but the
end goal there is our jobs! By
that process, our whole lives
are really just preparations for

But I don't think I could call
myself young anymore if when
asked how I was spending my
summer I started my reply with
"Working for..."
I can't wait to go home
for the summer, but my excite
ment certainly doesn't stem
from my job. It stems from
hanging out with my friends,
enjoying a nice dinner with my
girlfriend, spending Sundays
with my family, and getting a
warm "welcome-home" face
licking from Oliver.
Think of it this way: af¬

ter the summer entering your
senior year here, chances are
(unless you plan on being a
teacher or an outdoor ice skat
ing rink attendant) you will be
spending your summers work
ing. No more warm and sunny
three-month vacations. No
more weekly barbecues with
friends. No more unexpected
trips to the beach for a nice
four-day weekend. Real life is
just around the corner and I'm
not about to make the turn
until I absolutely have to. With
all this preparation for adult
hood we forget that we're still
kids. The number of people I
have tell me that they wish they
could get back to college is all
the convincing I need to assure
that I cherish this time. It's sad
but true, but this is our last
chance at true youth...and I
plan to make the most of it. I
hope you will too.

Conflict and Consensus

RA's are here to help not hurt their peers

Unfortunately, in The
Gettysburgian last week, an
anonymous and angered stu
dent unfairly lambasted the
Residence Life staff in the let
ter, "Rats on Campus?" As I
have had the opportunity to be
a member of the Residence Life
staff for two years, I find it ap
propriate as one of my last re
sponsibilities to uphold and
support the system that I fer
vently believe in.
The purpose of Residence
Life at Gettysburg College is to
"create a connection between
living and learning that is natu
ral, seamless, and
exciting...through the ideals of

respect, understanding, and
community" (Residence Life
Mission Statement).
Sounds simplistic does it
not? Yet the reality of the job
is that its complexity is great.
As the articulate, yet mis
guided, author of the anony
mous article stated, the college
"gives distinct and empowering
abilities to a select few and
leaves the vast majority impo
tent and 'differently abled"'.
There are two deeply
flawed, yet resolvable, prob
lems with this statement. One,
the assumption that RC/RA's
duties exceed our limited au
thority over our peers, and two

that an unequal distribution of
authority and responsibility
among peers is an incorrect
way to deal with violators of
Gettysburg College policies.
The assumption that, as
members of the Residence Life
staff, the only expectation
placed upon us is to enforce
rules established by the college
is not true. Our most time con
suming responsibilities are as
counselors, peer educators, and
social and academic resources.
This portion of our job is not
as public, nor as contested, as
that of policy enforcer. I fear
the assumption is therefore
made that these duties are not

fulfilled by RC/RA's.
However, if the curtains
were opened, our pessimistic
and temporarily narrow
minded peer would see the
daily one-on-one conversations
with residents, contacting ad
ministrators and support staff,
referrals, and necessary organi
zational duties. We are forced
to assume a position of peer
enforcer only after a peer has
made poor decisions and bro
ken policies clearly stated to
him\her in the Student Hand
book and Guidebook for Resi
dents. Therefore, if a student
has an issue with the way an

RC/RA enforces those rules
that he/she has broken, there is
a strong likelihood that the stu
dent should be upset with
themselves for breaking the
rules, not with the RC/RA for
enforcing them.
Furthermore, I firmly be
lieve that the mature way to
deal with one's anger over what
a student feels is an unfair situ
ation is to confront the RC/RA
directly. That would be an edu
cated response.
Secondly is the issue of
the peer to peer relationship

Eisenhower award
an honor to all

by Cammie Grant
Columnist The 1998 Eisenhower
Leadership Prize Dinner was
held Tuesday evening at the
Hilton Hotel in Washington
D.C. It was a very festive and
patriotic event. This year's re
cipient was William S. Cohen,
current U.S. Secretary of De
fense. Gettysburg College and
the Eisenhower World Affairs
Institute jointly give the
Eisenhower Leadership Prize.
The recipient must possess
qualities which reflect charac
teristics of Dwight D.

Eisenhower. President
Eisenhower was an honest,
charismatic individual who
took great pride in the United
States. Previous recipients of
the award are Lt. General Brent
Scowcroft, General Colin
Powell, Honorable Lloyd
Bentsen, Honorable Bob Dole,
President George Bush and
Nobel Laureate Elie Wiesel. In
addition to Cohen, these recipi
ents are all very deserving of
the award. They are amongst
the most prominent leaders of
our country. Awardees receive
$25,000 and a bronze replica
of President Eisenhower.
Cohen has an outstanding po¬

litical record. He served as a
Representative and Senator
from Maine and now serves as
the 20th Secretary of Defense,
under President Clinton. In
addition to his current position,
he also writes. He has either
authored or co-authored eight
books.
Prior to dinner, Cohen
addressed the audience. In his
speech, he spoke very highly of
Dwight D. Eisenhower. It was
interesting to listen to an ex
pert of defense comment on a
war hero. He also quoted au
thors and described the duties
of his current position. Cohen
also applauded Clinton for
crossing party lines in his cabi
net selections. He is a well
rounded individual who is per
sonable and intelligent. How
ever, he is very serious about
his job and takes great pride in
it.

After listening to Bob
Dole speak a few weeks ago
and Cohen Tuesday night, it is
easy to distinguish the charac
teristics that one must posses in
order to receive this great
honor. It is also an honor for
Gettysburg College to be in
volved with The Eisenhower
World Affairs Institute and the
wonderful leaders who are as
sociated with it.


Conflict and Consensus
Serious thoughts from random thinker

by Sara Sprenkle
Random Thinker
Something has been both
ering me for over a year. Now,
I have to attempt to write a ra
tional argument for something
that I am emotionally attached
to. Here goes everything.
I am impressed by the
number of letters about Dr.
Edward DeClair's tenure denial
that have been printed in The
Gettysburgian. What I haven't
seen are letters of support for
Dr. David Levine, who was also

denied tenure. This may have
been because Dr. Levine did
not wish to have any aggressive
reaction movement because the
person most hurt by these
things is the person that they
are meant to help. I respected
his wish—until now. This is the
last issue of The Gettysburgian
that will be printed while
Levine is still employed at Get
tysburg College, and I want
everyone to know that I think
that his tenure denial was one
of the worst decisions that the
College has ever made.

In The Gettysburgian's
Best of Gettysburg survey, 1
chose Dr. Levine as my favor
ite professor. (Features Editor
Barb Dickson can vouch for
me.) I have had Dr. Levine for
the majority of my computer
science courses, and I am glad
I did, since I won't have the
chance to take any classes from
him during my senior year.
Besides his extensive in
volvement within the depart
ment (programming team ad
visor, colloquium co-chair,
etc.), Dr. Levine is one of the

few professors who attends
events outside of his depart
ment. He is interested in many
other disciplines. An example
of this (from my understand
ing) is his work in the Spanish
Department with interactive
programs, which have been
turned over to different stu
dents since his initial work.
Partly because of his in
volvement, Dr. Levine is well
liked and supported by his col
leagues. In particular, I had a
conversation with a Political
Science professor who spoke
very highly of Levine when I
mentioned that I was disap
pointed that Levine was denied
tenure.
Dr. Levine is also one of
those professors that you can
find at work any day of the
week. He is always willing to
help a student or just chat with
you about baseball, current
events, or whatever else is on
your mind.

Having Dr. Levine as an
advisor isn't easy. You can
never say, "I want to get the
distribution requirements done
early" because you'll get your
self into a discussion about lib
eral arts colleges and what the
purpose of distribution require
ments is. If he senses that your
schedule is not difficult
enough, he will challenge you
to add another course or opt
for a harder course instead of
the one you're planning on tak
ing. Dr. Levine will do his best
to ensure that you get a good
education in your four years at
Gettysburg College.
Dr. Levine loves to teach.
He tells stories that seem unre¬

lated to the topic covered, but
he ties everything together, and
students understand concepts
better when they remember
things like "pizza values." But,
no one will ever claim that Dr.
Levine is an easy professor. Dr.
Levine has also helped me in
courses that he isn't teaching. I
knew that he'd be willing to
help me, and I would under
stand the material better if he
explained it to me.
Maybe I'm biased be
cause I have gotten to know Dr.
Levine well enough that I
would consider him a friend.
Sometimes, I got visibly upset
when we were interviewing
candidates to replace him, but
that's because I really regret
that Dr. Levine will not be here
next year at my graduation.
For this to be a legitimate
testament of Dr. Levine's supe
rior ability as a professor, I
must add some personal expe¬

.
I remember being in his
office during the Spring Semes
ter of my freshman year after a
Computer Science 103 test and
Dr. Levine's attempts to con
vince me to continue on to
Computer Science 104. I
should have told him that his
efforts were futile since my ad
visor had already signed my
form, and I was going to enroll
in CS104 in the fall. I guess it
doesn't matter really; the point
is that he took the time out to
tell me that he could see talent,
and I should continue on with
the discipline.
Sometime in either my
CS103 or CS104 course, Dr.
Levine told me that I had an

intuition for computer science.
I have often wondered how he
could tell that I had this "intu
ition," especially when I was
only in introductory courses. I
remember him telling me that
he had heard from other stu
dents that I was helping them
with their programs, and I
guess that's how he knew. (I
still kind of want to ask him,
but I always forget.) It's one
of those selfish things that I
want to know, and coming
from a person like him, a per
son that I respect and admire,
it's something that I'll want to

remember when I am disap
pointed with myself.
So, those things hap
pened two years ago. Dr.
Levine found out that he was
denied tenure in December of
1996. Nonetheless, he hasn't
forgotten his responsibilities as
a professor. Actually, what he
did was above and beyond the
call of duty. Last Monday, he
met with my group that partici
pated in the Mathematical
Contest in Modeling. We
didn't do as well as we would
have liked, and he met with us
to tell us how we could have

submitted a better entry. He
didn't disrespect us by empha
sizing the bad, but he was very
fair in his judgement. We came
away knowing that we had
done good work, but hadn't
presented it well. We know
where we can improve our pa
per when we compete in the
contest next year. Jokingly, Dr.
Levine ended our meeting with
"I hope you guys finish second,
behind the school I'm at next

That's enough reminisc
ing, but I think those are some
fine examples of a professor
who cares about his students,
even when he knows that these
are the students that he will be
rooting against next year. Why
should he help us? Gettysburg
College screwed him over. He
should say to hell with the stu
dents as well. I'm so grateful
he hasn't taken that attitude
because I would have missed a
lot of learning opportunities if
he had.
Finally, one of the worst
parts of this fiasco is that noth
ing has come out of these de
nials of two well-liked profes
sors—professors who really
teach and care about students.
The factionalized Political Sci
ence department would not
cease individual pettiness and

infighting to effect a change,
and Dr. Levine did not want
anything from his department.
I hope if (or when?) a
similar situation occurs, stu
dents in both affected depart
ments can rally together and
get some changes made. Did
anything ever come out of
those town meetings? I don't
think so. I think they were
thrown out at us to give us a
little gratification, but nothing
has changed. Worthy profes
sors will continue to be denied
tenure in favor of unworthy
professors.
In conclusion, Sara (along
with others who didn't know
what to say or how to say it)
says, "Good luck, Dr. Levine,
and teach your students to aca
demically shame Gettysburg
College."

Housing at Gettysburg is in need of serious change

To the Editor:

Disorganization +
injustice + chaos +
angry students = room
selections by the lottery
system I have to admit I was sur
prised on April 15,1998 which
happened to be a Wednesday
when my roommate for next
year and I were told with a
large number of other people
that the school was out of hous
ing. Yeah. Out of housing.
The people in charge at this
"housing meeting" assured us
that every student will get
housing because of drop outs,
expulsions, etc. However, the
rooms ran out before passing
the number 415 out of 600+.
I don't really comprehend how
there will be openings for al
most two- hundred students.

It is an interesting situa
tion because all of my friends
who also attend fine academic
institutions have their housing
set for the most part. Many of
them have apartment like com
plexes set up for the coming
year or at least their normal
housing is set and ready to go.

They were also very surprised
and amused that there were
restrictions for living off-cam
pus. But, they are all very
pleased with their situation.
And somehow myself and a
large group of other students
find ourselves in a ridiculous
limbo crap shoot. If by some
miracle the confused flock of
students including myself
should all be housed, I seriously
doubt we will all be in our
proper places. I know that my
roommate and I have no inten
tion of living in Lamp Post,
Carlisle or any of the other
"special house." But, because
of the overflow in people and
the disorganization within the
system we have been told that
this might happen. All we want
is a normal and decent living
environment and a place also
conducive to study and relax
ation. However, we should be
living in more than a decent liv
ing environment for $2,656 a

year.
Getting off-campus: an
unnecessary stubborn
fight

Before even having the
joy of attending the "housing
meeting" I had been in the pro
cess of trying to convince the
ever-powerful Residence Life
committee to give permission
to three of my friends and my
self to get an off- campus house
that was available. I have talked
to many upperclassmen about
this subject and the reply is al
ways something like "good luck
man...it's ###@@@ impos
sible." This off campus hous
ing opportunity was extraordi
nary in its location and price.
I'm not going to mention what
the price was compared to the
$2,656 that my parents and I
pay for a very small room here
and the privilege of sharing
bathrooms and showers with

twenty other people because it
could cause a riot, and I'm not
a violent person. Even after
talking to my parents, Resi
dence Life were still as stub
born as goats. My friends and
I that were interested in this
house are not involved in fra
ternities but do have a band
that needs space to play and
keep equipment. The music

department has not helped us
in the least bit in storing our
equipment or giving us a place
to play. My old high school
offered more support to music
than this very prestigious insti
tution. But all this will be ad
dressed in another article. My
point is: why should I not be
able to establish residence off
campus if I desire to? Is this
boarding school, or military
school in which I have to earn
the ranks in order to gain privi
leges. I am here for an educa
tion not to be told were to live.
I don't want to give off the
wrong idea here. When using
the housing of the school it
makes sense that they have a
say in where people live. The
point I am trying to get across
is that I am nineteen years old,
and two of my friends which I
was planning to room with in
this beautiful house will be

twenty by next semester. A
person can establish legal resi
dency in the U.S. at age eigh
teen years old. Why do I have
a problem establishing resi
dence off-campus at nineteen
years old at Gettysburg Col¬

lege? When asking to move
off-campus my friends and I are
not asking anything from the
College itself. We are just ask
ing to be on our own as we are
entitled to. Maybe the College
doesn't want to loose the
money and just wants our
families to pay the ridiculous
room rates. However, this does
not make sense taking into con
sideration that all the campus
living areas are filled right now.
I know that the reply to this
from some higher authority

will be "spaces will open."
Maybe they will and maybe
they will not. And... maybe
just maybe my roommate and
I will be placed into the desired
living area. But, still I feel vio
lated that I can not reserve the
right to live on my own con
sidering the only thing holding
me back is permission from the
school. I am not sure why I
need anyone else's permission
to do something as basic as liv
ing where I want considering I
am held as an adult by the law
and government.

Conflict and Consensus

Macs will be around for at least a couple more years

To the Editor:

The "Consider This" col
umn of April 23, 1998 dealt
with the debate over
Macintoshes vs. PCs on the
Gettysburg College Campus.
Some of the statements in the
article seem to be based on a
misunderstanding of the
College's current policy in this
area. This policy, like every
thing in the world of comput
ing, is examined and updated
frequently, and it is often hard
to promulgate the latest
changes.
A faculty committee com
prised of seven members from
various disciplines, called the
Information Resources Advi
sory Committee (IRAQ, exam
ined the Mac vs. PC issue dur
ing the past year in order to
provide recommendations to
Provost DeNicola.

These recommendations the April 2,1998 faculty meet

are the basis for our current ing
policy. IRAC's efforts focused
on three important topics:
1) What type of com-
puter should the college recom
mend to incoming students?
2) What type of com-
puter should the college recom-
mend for faculty and staff desk-
tops? 3) When a public lab such
as Glatfelter 112 (Macintosh)
becomes obsolete, what should
be the replacement or upgrade
strategy?
IRAC examined these
questions by considering costs,
long term impact on academ-
ics, curriculum support, faculty
freedom, industry trends and
technical support. Their com
plete list of recommendations
can be found in the minutes of

_ei
rol cor ;
anc to_;
res: Careful analysis of the is
sues led IRAC to endorse the
following:
1) Gettysburg College
will recommend Windows
compatible computers for all
new students. Currently en
rolled students with Macs will
continue to be fully supported
until they graduate. IRAC
could not identify any Mac spe
cific software that was manda
tory for students to run on their
computers and Information
Resources and Computing has
indicated it would realize a cost
and staff savings if it only had
to support one platform in the
residence halls.
The College owned Mac
labs will continue to be avail
able for students who need ac¬

cess to specialized Mac soft
ware. This year our incoming
first year class owned 10%
Macs vs 90% PCs, reflecting a
continuing trend towards PC's
that was felt in other schools
across the nation.
2) IRAC's second recom
mendation is that the Mac lab
in Glatfelter Hall will be con
figured with 16 new Macs
(most likely Apple G3's) plus a
seventeenth unit for the in
structor. This upgraded lab will
be configured to provide in
structors with a more conve
nient teaching arrangement
and with space for two students
to work at one computer. Since
the Mac Lab in Glatfelter cur
rently holds 22 computers, the
remaining computers will be
upgraded with PCs and will be
relocated to Musselman Li
brary. No changes are recom¬

mended for the other public
labs at this time.
3) IRAC's third recom
mendation is that Gettysburg
College will continue to sup
port both the Windows and
Mac operating systems. Faculty
and departments may continue
to use the platform they choose
as best suited for their work.
If both platforms are equally
suitable in satisfying user needs,
conversion to the Windows
operating system may result in
some saving for the College
and should be considered. The
College will provide conver
sion assistance to support and
assist the departments and fac
ulty converting from the Mac
to the Windows operating sys
tem.

by Ted Hartman
Staff Reporter The Bullets' baseball
squad is in its hnal week of play.
This spring saw Gettysburg get
off to an impressive 8-3 start
and then fall out of playoff con
tention, losing six of seven
games. Though tallying a dis
appointing 8-10 Cenntenial
Conference record, the Bullets
were able to salvage a winning
season at 18-17.
Recent successful indi
vidual and team performances
have given Gettysburg baseball
hope for next season. The Bul
lets blanked York 10-0 on Tues
day with a combination of
clutch hitting and errorless de
fense.

Defensive problems
plagued Gettysburg through
the middle of the year, extend
ing innings and tiring pitchers.
Freshman hurler Drew Chiesa
enjoyed the play in the field
Tuesday and went the distance,

allowing for
only five hits.
Chiesa and
Freshman Pat

two first year
hurlers that
should prove
to be an im

of the squad

New addition to the Bul
lets' lineup, Kit Wannen, has
also contributed impressively.
First-year studend Wannen did
not play in the first half of the
spring, however, in a handful
of late season appearances, he
was able to take over the start
ing catching job. Brett Thorp
was also able to make a big
impact on the lineup as a fresh
man, and is now the everyday
short-stop.
The Bullets concluded
this season in fourth place in
the Cenntenial Conference,
falling behind champion Johns
Hopkins, Ursinus, and Wash
ington College. Only the first
two teams in the Conference
qualify for the Division III tour
nament, and therefore the Bul
lets' season will end with
tomorrow's non-league game
versus Lebanon Valley. Coach
Campo is very optimistic with
the crop of incoming freshmen
and the return of all current
players.



Bullets softball squad stays on target, has record breaking year

by Bill Davidson
Staff Reporter The Lady Bullets had _t
disappointing close to their fan
tastic season, losing their final
three games to finish with a 24
10 record. Sweeping Lebanon
Valley College to begin the
week, the women seemed
poised for a championship run.
However, a decisive loss tc
Messiah and a doubleheadei
drubbing inflicted by Western
Maryland left them short of a
conference championship.
At Lebanon Valley, Angie

Hoptak tossed a 3-hitter, strik
ing out one batter and walking
none as the Gettysburg women
notched a 3-1 victory.
Erin Killeen's two RBI
single in the top of the 7th
capped a 3-run rally to defeat
the Flying Dutchwomen. In
the nightcap, Karyn Miller had
four singles in as many at bats,
scoring two runs and driving in
one, as the Lady Bullets com
pleted the sweep. Sara
Graveline also supplied offen
sive punch, lacing a two RBI
double in the 5th. Suzanne
Dailey picked up the win with
seven strong innings.

After being 1-hit by Mes
siah, the women were swept by
Western Maryland, dropping
decisions of 10-1 and 5-0.
Despite this disappointing end,
several Bullets enjoyed record
setting seasons.
Defensively, Erin Killeen
surpassed her own single sea
son putout record, improving
from 218 a year ago to 237.
Jen White narrowly passed Tif
fany Wright's ('97) year-old
record for at-bats in a season,
finishing with 104 to Wright's

103. Karyn Miller batted .484
on the season, shattering the
previous mark of .468 set by
Jacquie Gatti in 1991. White
and Miller also broke Mary
Sautter's 11 year-old record of
38 hits in a season, with 46
apiece.
The future of Gettysburg
softball is promising. Their
entire pitching staff returns,
including strikeout leader (21),
Angie Hoptak and wins leader,
(7) Suzanne Dailey.
In addition to White and
Miller, the Bullets also return
defensive standout, Sara
Graveline; stolen base leader,
Jess Rising; and emerging star,

Casey Stevens.
"I think next year's team
will be in the running for the
conference title," said an opti
mistic Coach Kirkpatrick. "1
feel we have a very strong core
returning to maintain our win
ning tradition."
The Bullets, however,
will need to fill holes created
by the loss of the three senior
captains: Traci Bullock,
Marybeth Korejko, and Jill
Murphy. Coach Kirkpatrick
had flattering remarks for all of
them. "Jill is an outstanding stu
dent of the game. She was al
ways willing to sacrifice herself
for the good of the team."
"Traci has an outstanding
arm and was probably our most
:onsistent player."

"Marybeth was a very in
tegral part of our defense and
offense. At third she was steady
and occasionally outstanding."
"As a group, these young
women showed excellent lead
ership both on and off the field.
They thought of the team first
and themselves last. It has been
more than a pleasure to have
coached them and an honor to
have known them,"
Kirkpatrick commented.

Bullet hurler Mellissa Hazzard fires a seed towards home
Hazzard will be back next year as one of the primary Bullet
pitchers.

Bullets reign as champs begins again

by Henry Fawell
Assistant News Editor

riade a turn for the better on
Saturday, as they took hold of
the tempo early-on against
F&M and never let go.
"Marymount opened our eyes
a little bit a few days before,"
said senior Mike McCrain,
"then we realized we were a
game away from the champi
onship and we wanted to close
it out with a big win."
Scott Lowery, arguably
the most consistent player this
year for the Bullets, helped seal
the deal with an eight point
performance, on five goals and
three assists. Jamie Bateman

added another three goals,
while juniors Ross Garretson
and Lee Hemming each scored
twice for Gettysburg.
The Bullets offense reeled
off 42 shots in all, while the
defense held the Diplomats to
just 12. Andrew Barter col
lected six saves in the victory.
Gettysburg's final regular
season game comes this Satur
day when they travel to Ithaca
College in New York. Ithaca is
currently ranked No. 8 in Di
vision HI and will be looking
to upset the Bullets in order
gain home field advantage for
the NCAA Tornament.

The Gettysburg men's la
crosse squad captured the Cen
tennial Conference champion
ship on Saturday by pounding
Franklin & Marshall on their
home field by a score 16-5. The
victory marked the third time
in the conference's five year
existence that Gettysburg has
captured the crown, the past
two coming in 1994 and 1995.
The win on Saturday did
not come, however, before a
mid-week scare from unranked
Division I opponent
Marymount University, who
caught the Bullets off-guard
and nearly escaped with a stun
ning upset. Marymount was
able to muster a 6-3 halftime
lead, but could not hold the
advantage against a second half
Gettysburg comeback.

The Bullets scored four
unanswered goals in the third
quarter, but still found them
selves in a battle that would
wage up until the final minutes.

assisted goal with 2:30 left in

for good.
Junior Rob Crowe deliv
ered an outstanding perfor
mance in the afternoon, as he
won a perfect 10 of 10 face-

offs and put in the final goal of
the first half, which cut
Marymount's lead to three
goals. "They were a surprisingly

good team, " said senior Jamie
Bateman, "We only beat them
6-4 last year and we were lucky
to get a win from them this
year." Gettysburg fortunes


Track teams ready to shine

If past form holds true, as
many as four or five schools
could be in the hunt for the
women's team title when the
Centennial Conference con
ducts its annual outdoor track
and field championship this
weekend at Haverford College.
On the men's side, how
ever, the other eight schools
will, in all likelihood, be chas
ing Haverford, which has
emerged as the team champion
four years in a row.
Gettysburg women, who
are the defending champions
and have never placed lower
than third in the team stand
ings, figure to be a contender
for fhe conference title. Cathy
Spangler is the defending con
ference chamipon in the
women's discus, she won that
svent last year as a freshman

with a toss of 116' 11 . Sopho
more Beth Castagno, who
holds Gettysburg's high jump
record at 5'6", has the poten
tial to take the conference title
and jump 5'7" this weekend.
Other track and field ath
letes who are expected to place
high and do well this weekend
are Tabitha Gary (high, long,
and triple jumps), Jackie Klug
(100m Hurdles, long jump),
Andi Therit (100m, 200m),
Anne Schenck (100m, long and
high jump), and Karen Helmick
(1500m, 3000m).
Last year, the men fin
ished fourth, behind
Haverford, Swarthmore and
Western Maryland. The men
also have hopes of running
avvay with the title. Senior
Nathan Grim, who will be trav
eling to the NCAA tournament
for the shot-put on May 20-23,
placed first in the shot and dis
cus at last year's outdoor con¬

ference meet.
This weekend, Grim
hopes to improve upon last
year's performance, where he
broke both meet and confer
ence records. Grim's best ef
fort this season in the shot is
52' 11". Senior Bryan Sentz
will also figure prominently in
the conference meet, compet
ing in the pole-vault, long
jump, 100m, 200m and the
1600m relay.
Junior Brendon Clark,
who has a season best of
1:59.16 in the 800m, will be
running for the championship
in both the 800m and 1500m
runs. Leading the distance
squad, along with Clark, will
be first-year student Jonathon
Catlett in the 1500m and
3000m steeple chase.

Despite the predictions
for nasty weather this weekend,
these Bullets are expected to
shine.

prepares to throw at the top of the conference.

This special athlete will GRAB your attention

Whether she is scoring goals or helping people reach theirs, Kristin Sullivan has been an
integral part of many lives at Getysburg for the past four years...

by Steve Jenkins
Sports Editor
Somebody hand me a dic
tionary. All right, somewhere
in here there have to be a few
words that I can use to describe
the person that Kristin Sullivan
has become. Hmmm, nope,
there are no words that can pin
point this amazing woman ex
actly, but man, we can try. With
nothing but toughness, a tire
less work ethic, and a desire to
help others, "Sully" as her
friends call her has left a per
manent imprint on the students
of Gettysburg College.
As you may or may not
already know, Sullivan is a
dominant force on the lacrosse
field. She dumfounds defend
ers, flying effortlessly past them
with her tremendous speed,
then changes her stick to her
non-dominant left hand
"schooling" anyone who gets in
her way. And to think it all
started just four years ago.

What? There is no way
that Sully just started playing
lacrosse her freshman year. It
is impossible to go from never
having picked up a stick to Di
vision III All-America in only
four years! Well, impossible is
not a word that is in Kristin's
vocabulary. "Nothing is im
possible," she says, "if you
work hard, and push yourself
to the edge, you can reach all
of your goals." It is this men
tality that has made Sullivan
such a successful leader, men
tor, and role model, but she has
also had some good teachers.
The one person that has
been the most important in
Sullivan's life is her father. "He

is always there for me, even a
when there looked like there _^
was no hope, or when I was
really down. He always had
a card for me. He always
has a way of renewing my _Jm
faith in my team and _^jSfl
the job I have to get _^HP
done. I could J§3_gF
never replace jmB/_F
Kristin's fa-_^S2_t_^
ther instilled in
her the will never to
quit, never to let the difficulty

of a task scare you, no matter
what the odds. That is why she
has become so successful, that
is why she is such a dynamic
character.
"My brother and I used
to battle," Kristin, reminisces.
"We used to watch the Price is
Right, and in between commer
cial breaks... man we used to
go at it. I never yelled to see
Bob Barker and the Showcase
Showdown more in my life."
So, being one of the younger
kids in her family Kristin took

many a beating, but as we see
today on the lacrosse field Sully
is no stranger to dishing out
some pain on the opposing de
fense as well.
If you have ever seen
Sully play lacrosse, there would
be no doubt in your mind that
she is a leader. "I think that a
leader has 'moves' on and off
the field. I am one of the only
older players that the young
freshman and sophomores have
to look up to. I try to do my
best on and off the field to be

fair, establish
initiative,
and show
them no
matter
what ¦ » '
that '«"
there is
always
hope."
With
Sim ' _^

f and myself, and pushing people
to their full potential. We all
want everyone involved to be
the best they can be and find
_«_a _^ _j out the most about them
SgjaE|i ^_ se lves as they can. Through
all of our activities that is

rha d her
work cut out
for her. But like
any of these young
players will tell you,
Kristin Sullivan has ,
been a model of in- _(
tegrity, guts, and j
that scrappy atti¬

tude that have people in awe what we hope to promote... re
of her character. spect, truth, self-confidence,
The proudest moment and pushing yourself until you

that Sully can remember was
this year during a Centennial
Conference clash with Ursinus.
"I just remember thinking after
we won that I was so satisfied.
I was so proud of the younger
players. Nobody expected us
to beat them. We were so
'young'. But we sucked it up,
tackled the challenge, and said
'hey if you play with us we are
gonna kick your butt.' It just
made all the hard work worth
while, you know? It was a tre
mendous feeling for me and the
team."
Sullivan's work ethic has
not always been the intense lo¬

comotive train that it is now. In
fact, in the fall of her junior year
she had a big turn-around when
she did a transfer semester at
Duke University. "I went down
to Duke and everyone was so
intense and passionate about ev
erything. I just picked up on
what they were doing, and de
cided that I was going to reach
my full potential everyday. I
worked out seven days a week,
I just kept going." Working to
her full potential is a idea that
Kristin personifies and it has a
truly amazing effect on every
person she meets.

This spark lit a fire in
Sullivan to really do everything
in her life with all the intensity
of a bolt of lightning, and that
was when she found GRAB
That is right, you know GRAB,
the Gettysburg Recreational
Adventure Board, oh yeah, well
that is Kristin Sullivan. "Yeah,
one day my friend Brad
McCutcheon asked me if I
wanted to be a part of starting
this program, and I filled out
the application. I guess you
could call all of the members
that year the pioneers of
? GRAB, the rest is history."
C "GRAB is such an un
m portant thing in my life," says
* Sullivan, "It has taught me so
much about respect for others

have nothing left."
Sully could not possibly
name all the important people
who played such a tremendous
role in the _ >_u*^ . ..
matura

rvi if h ?* i-i
tion of
GRAB,
but she
said that
she
was /
s o

_^^F her thoughts
_^H and feelings in
_^B t he organiza
H tion. "GRAB
W _tft helped me to
P&f\ discover All

_^_gHti/_Rr self. the m
people that I came in
contact with were on the same
page as me. We all shared the
same mentality; the same pas
sion for living life to the full
est. I am so thankful that I was
a part of something this great.
It [GRAB] was our baby, and I
know we have people here now
that are going to help it grow."
Kristin Sullivan is going
to take all of the things that she
has learned on the field, as well
as on the rock wall, with her
into the future. What is she
going to do, you ask? Well, as
of now, she has plans to go into
the Peace Corps in South
America. She has not received
her orders yet, but regardless
of where she will be, she will
help the people there in more

ways than they know. We can
only hope the Peace Corps
knows what a special person
that they are getting, and what
kind of persona this strong
woman brings to the table.
I asked Kristin if she had
any regrets about her four years
here at Gettysburg. She looked
at the ceiling in the Bullet Hole,
searching. Then, with a tear in
her eye, she said to me, "I just
want more time. I'm not ready
to leave yet. I want to see
GRAB go. I just want
. ;O * to play lacrosse forever.
_$_P I just have such a strong
feeling for so many
things here. I don't want to
leave my friends, but that is the
way it goes, I guess."
Well, for this Environ
mental Science major/Biology

minor, who takes her bike ev
k erywhere, time is something
_^ that she will never hav e to
_^K worry about. She has left
_^K a legacy here at Gettys
W_* burg that everyone who
has been a part of her life
will always remember. Sully
can barely begin to understand
how much she has meant to so
many people here at Gettys
¦ t burg and for that we are for
i ever indebted to her.
I Kristin Sullivan has
* just about two weeks left
Bk"\ at this school before she
El receives her diploma.
Sp Which is good news for
Wjf all of you. That means
B you have two weeks left
to get to know this dy
namic, persevering, passionate
woman who has an intensity
for life like nobody has ever

seen. So, hustle over to the
GRAB house, where Kristin
lives, and set up an appoint
ment to sit down and talk to
this intense, awesome woman.
Oh yeah, as you talk to her, leaf
through your favorite pages of
the dictionary and try to find
some words to describe her.
You won't find any, but you can
try. You can look all over the
world for another a person like
Kristin Sullivan; you won't find
one... but you can try.

Double the pleasure, double the fun...

The doubles teams of Wells and Cutter and Yoshida and Schmitt bring home titles

by Bev-Freda Jackson
Staff Reporter
The mens' and womens'
tennis teams seasons officially
came to an end this past week
end. Both teams traveled to
Franklin 8c Marshall to partici
pate in the Centennial Confer
ence Championships.
Laura Bauer, Kay Co
Francesco, Patrick Delaney,
Bev-Freda Jackson, Chris
Rippey, and Dan Veschi saw
early round singles action on
Friday evening and Saturday

morning.
Doubles action for
Gettyburg's teams of Tara
Schmitt and Masako Yoshida
and Brandon Cutter and
Weston Wells began at 9:00 am
on April 25. Schmitt and
Yoshida made quick work of
their early round opponents
and posted impressive victo
ries. They defeated Swarth
more in semifinal action, thus
staging a showdown against
Western Maryland.
Schmitt and Yoshida suf¬

fered a conference loss to West
ern Maryland, last years' con
ference doubles champions,
earlier in the season, and the
Bullets were eager to set the
record straight. Schmitt and
Yoshida proved that they were
the best doubles team in the
Centennial Conference and
took the title in straight sets.
They dominated each set with
aggressive net play, consistent
groundstrokes and excellent
strategy.
Brandon Cutter and
Weston Wells had an impressive
record throughout the season,
going undefeated. This doubles
team had not lost a match all
season and was determined to
keep this trend throughout the
tournament.

Wells and Cutter played
impressive doubles and made
quick work of their opponents,
handing a defeat to Ursinus in
the semifinals. The serving
power of Wes Wells and all
